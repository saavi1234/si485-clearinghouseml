Plaintiff was arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant and was subjected to two strip searches upon his arrival at the Jail.  The strip searches were conducted pursuant to the Sheriff's General Order 506 which, up until February 25, 2007, mandated that all detainees except those in protective custody be strip searched on admission to the jail and again before leaving the jail to go to court.  Plaintiff claimed that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and requested that the Court award compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  </p><p>On March 14, 2008, Plaintiff filed a Motion of Class Certification. Plaintiff sought to represent a class of approximately 400 people who were illegally strip searched at the Jail. The proposed class consists of all people strip searched without individualized reasonable suspicion on or after March 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the Jail. On April 15, 2008, the Court (Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman) granted Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification.</p><p>The parties conducted discovery from July 2007 to November 2008, after which they both filed Motions for Summary Judgment. On October 22, 2009, in a Memorandum and Order, the Court (Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman) granted Plaintffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and denied Defendants' Cross Motion.</p><p>Following the Court's ruling, the parties entered settlement negotiation. After several months' negotiation, the parties signed the Settlement Agreement on June 24, 2010. The Court approved the parties's Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement on July 12, 2010. An Amended Settlement Agreement was filed on July 15, 2010. Plaintiffs filed a Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement on December 23, 2010. On January 14, 2011, the Court (Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman) approved the Class Action Settlement. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Commonwealth agreed to pay on behalf of all Defendants $1,162,468 to settle all claims brought by Plaintiffs in this action, including claims for attorney's fees and costs.</p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs submit this memorandum in support of the parties' joint motion for final approval \nof the settlement in this civil rights class action. \nThe Court granted preliminary approval to the settlement agreement on July 12, 2010. The \nagreement provides that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will pay $1,162,468 on behalf of both \nDefendants to resolve all of Plaintiffs' claims, including clairus for costs and attorney's fees. The 487 \nclass members received individual notice of the settlement, along witb a clairu  form,  whenever \npossible;  notice was  otherwise provided by  multiple  methods  designed  to  reach  as  many  class \nmembers as possible. To date, 250 class members, or 51 % of the class, have submitted valid claim \nforms - an extraordinarily high rate of return for a prisoners' rights class action. No class members \nhave ftled any objections to the settlement, and only one class member has opted out.' \nAfter payment of clairus administration expenses, litigation expenses, an incentive award to \nthe class representative, and attorneys' fees,  all of the remaining settlement fund balance will be \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 2 of 16\nev-enly divided arn()l1g participating class melnbers, If the Court approves the all10unts requested for \ncosts, fees,  and the incentive payment, each participating class member will receive approximately \n$2,850. Because of the high participation rate, the reversion and CJI pres provisions of the agreement -\nwhich  provide that  funds  remaining after distribution  to  class  members will  be divided equally \nbetween Prisoners' Legal Services and the Commonwealth - do not apply. \nThe settlement is the product of contested and lengthy negotiations. It is fair, reasonable and \nadequate.  For  these  reasons,  it  warrants  the  Court's  final  approval,  which  will  permit  the \nCommonwealth to make the required payments under the agreement. \nII.  CASE BACKGROUND \nTbis is  a civil rights class action under 42 U.S.c. § 1983 against Franklin County Sheriff \nFredcrick Macdonald and Special Sheriff Forbes Byron. Plaintiff, Gregory Garvey, Sr., filed suit on \nMarch 28,  2007,  alleging that Defendants maintained a policy of strip  searching all individuals \nadmitted to the Franklin County Jail without individualized suspicion, in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment. This policy was in place throughout the class period, which runs from March 28, 2004, \nto Fehruary 24, 2007, inclusive. On April 15, 2008, the Court certificd the following class under Fed. \nR.Civ. P. 23 (b) (3): \nAll people strip searched without individualized reasonable suspicion on or after \nMarch 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the Franklin County Jail \n(a)  while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being \narrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a \nviolent felony, or \n(b)  while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default \nor  other  warrant  for  charges  that  did  not  involve  a  weapon,  drugs, \ncontraband or a violent felony. \nI See Declaration of David Milton (\"Milton Dec!.\") ~ 5. \n2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 3 of 16\nTIle parties conducted discovery froin July 2007 to N overI1ber 2008, after which they filed \ncross motions for summary judgment. On October 22, 2009, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion \nfor summary judgment and denied Defendants'. \nFollowing the Court's ruling, the parties spent several months determining who was in the \nclass, a necessary precursor to negotiating a settlement. After extensive review of individual intake \nfiles and of the applicable law, the parties reached agreement as to who was in the class and who was \nnot. The parties then began settlement discussions in earnest. After several months of negotiations, \nthe parties signed the settlement agreement on June 24, 2010. \nOn July  12,  2010,  the  Court  held  a  hearing  and  granted  preliminary  approval  of the \nsettlement agreement; appointed Analytics, Inc., as claims administrator; approved the class notice \nand notice plan, as altered during the hearing; and setJanuary 14, 2011, as the date for the f1nal \nfairness hearing. On July 16,2010, the parties f11ed amended settlement documents to conform to \nthe changes discussed at the July 12 hearing. \nIII.  SUMMARY OF THE SETTLEMENT \nUnder the settlement, the Commonwealth agrees to pay on behalf of Defendants $1,162,468 \nto settle all claims brought by Plaintiffs in this action, including claims for attorney's fees and costs. \nThe agreement provides for a cash payment of up to $3,500 to every person who meets the class \ndef1nition and submits a claim form.  Only one payment will be made to each class  member no \nmatter how many  times  during the class  period he or she was  admitted into the jail  and strip \nsearched. \nClass counsel recommends and Defendants do not oppose an incentive payment of $20,000 \nto tile named Plaintiff, Gregory Garvey, Sr., to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a result of \nbringing this case and for the time he spent working with counsel to bring about the favorable result \n3 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 4 of 16\nfor the class. Attorney's fees and expenses, including the costs of administering the settlement, will \nbe  deducted  from  the  settlement  amount  before  calculating  the  distribution  amount  to  class \nmembers. Class counsel have ftled a motion requesting that the Court award a fee of one-third of \nthe gross settlement amount, or $387,489.33. Counsel's total costs will not exceed $42,498, of which \n$12,498 represents litigation costs2 and up to $30,000 represents the costs of claims administration.1 \nAfter  the  above  payments  are  deducted  from  the  total  settlement  amount,  each  class \nmember who submitted a valid claim form will receive a payment of approximately $2,8504  Because \nno funds will be left over after every participating class member receives a payment, no money will \nbe given to Prisoners' Legal Services under the doctrine of 'y preJ, and no money will revert to the \nCommonwealth. \nIV.  THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR, REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE \nA.  The Settlement Is Entitled to a Presumption of Reasonableness. \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), the Court must hold a hearing and determine if tl,e settlement is \n\"fair, reasonable and adequate.\" See Nat'l AsJ'n of Chain Drl(~ Stores I!. New Eng. Health BenefitJ Fund, \n582 F.3d 30, 44 (1st Cir. 2009); Dumtt v. H01lsingAuth. ofProviden,~, 896 F.2d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1990). \n\"If the parties negotiated at arm's length and conducted sufficient discovery, the district court must \npresume the settlement is reasonable.\" Id.; aavrd City Pshp.  Co.  v. Atlantic Acquisition Ltd.  Pshp.,  100 \nF.3d 1041, 1043 (lstCir.1996). \n2 Milton Decl. ~ 19. \n3 Under the settlement agreement, the payment to the Claims Administrator is capped at $30,000, based on a detailed \nestimate provided by Analytics at the time of the agreement was made. As of November 24,2010, Analytics \nestimated its fees to date to be $23,000; this figure will go up as Analytics continues to respond to class member \ninquiries, processes changes of address and other administrative matters, and, if the settlement is approved, prepares \nthe final distribution list. Milton Decl. 1120. \n4 The actual amount will be slightly more if the Claims Administrator's final fee is less than $30,000. \n4 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 5 of 16\nThe setdement in this case warrants the presumption of reasonableness. The parties' claims \nand defenses were thorougbly litigated. The parties reached setdement only after vigorous arm's \nlength negotiations. \n1.  The parties conducted extensive discovery. \n\"The  stage  of the  proceedings  at which  setdement is  reached  is  important  because  it \nindicates how fully the district court and counsel are able to evaluate the merits of plaintiffs' claims.\" \nRolland p. Ce!!ud, 191 F.RD. 3, 10 (D. Mass. 2000) (quoting Duhaime 1). John HalltVck Mutua! fflJurance, \n177 F.R.D. 54 at 67 (D. Mass. 1997)).  Plaintiffs in this case had the benefit of a complete discovery \nperiod, and a ruling on the merits from the Court, before entering into the settlement. \nPlaintiffs took extensive discovery both on the merits of their claims and on the composition \nof the class. Plaintiffs took eleven depositions, sent document requests, and propounded two sets of \ninterrogatories  to  each  Defendant.  Plaintiffs'  counsel  reviewed  multiple  complex  electronic \nspreadsheets and voluminous paper booking records. \nDuring discovery, Plaintiffs identified approximately 580 individuals as likely to fit the class \ndefinition based on Defendants' records. To arrive at the fmal class list, Defendants reviewed the \nintake files and other materials for nearly aU of these individuals. Plaintiffs' counsel, in tnm, reviewed \nthe  materials  Defendants provided from  these  files  that allegedly disqualified  certain individuals \nfrom the class. The parties also conducted legal research to determine, among other things, whether \nparticular crimes should be deemed \"violent felonies.\" Then counsel discussed the application of \n5 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 6 of 16\nthis research to the class definition. Eventually counsel came to an agreement. As a result of this \nintensive review process, the parties agreed that 486 individuals met the class definitions \n2.  The negotiations occurred at arm's length. \nThis settlement is the result of vigorous negotiations. After the Court granted summary \njudgment in October 2009, the parties began to discuss settlement. As a threshold matter, the parties \nneeded to know the size of the class, which in turn required the parties to agree on who met the \nclass definition. This process alone took several months. After determining class size, the parties \nnegotiated for several months before agreeing on all terms of the written settlement agreement. \nB.  Other Factors Confirm the Reasonableness of the Agreement. \nThe First Circuit has not mandated any single test for determining whether a settlement \nmeets the standard for reasonableness under Rule 23(e). Jee In re Relaftn An/i/rt/J/ Litig., 231  F.R.D. \n52,72 (D. Mass. 2005); Rolland v.  Cellum; 191 F.R.D. 3, 8 (D.

Indus. Avg. Whole.rale Prite Utig., 588 F.3d 24, 44 (1st Cit. 2009). \nIn  Rolland,  this  Court  identified  eight  factors  courts  have  considered:  \"(1)  Plaintiffs' \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2)  the amount and nature of discovery or evidence; (3)  the \nactual settlement terms and conditions; (4)  the recommendation and experience of counsel; (5) the \nfuture expense and likely duration of litigation; (6) the recommendation of neutral parties, if any; (7) \n5 During tbe claims period, an additional individual was added to tbe class after review of information he submitted \nto the Claims Administrator, and of Defendants' records, showed that be met the class definition. Twenty-three (23) \nother individuals not on the class list submitted claims, which were denied after review of Defendants' records \nconfirmed that they did not meet the class definition.

Likelihood of success on the merits \nEach class  member will receive approximately $2,850 if the settlement and all  attendant \nrequests are approved. Class members risked getting much less, or nothing, if the case went to triaL \nBy reaching a compromise, Plaintiffs avoid the risks they would have faced by proceeding to triaL \nAlthough  this  Court determined  liability  in  Plaintiffs'  favor,  three  recent decisions  from  other \ncircuits  have  presented ilie  possibility  iliat the Supreme Court may soon  take  up  the  issue  of \nprearraignmcnt strip-searches, potcntially overtuling the First Circuit precedent on which this Court \nrelied. In Florence  Bd. of Chosen  Freeholdm of Burlington, 621  F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2(10), Buill). City and \nIJ. \nCounty of San Framisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc), Powell v.  Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11 th \nCir. 200S) (en banc), ilie Third, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits held that blanket strip searches of non-\nfelons at the time of admission to jail are constitutional; iliere is now a circuit split. By settling, class \nmembers avoid any risk of losing on the merits because of future changes in the law. \nMoreover, if damages  claims  were decided  individually  by a  jury,  class  members risked \nwinning  less  than  $2,850,  or  winning  only  nominal  damages7  Particularly  in  this  economic \nenvironment, juries may not feel generous to former arrestees. Any individual who believed he or \n\"In Rolland, the Court also considered the effect of the settlement, ifany, on third parties. Rolland, 191 F.R.D.  at 9. \nThis factor is inapplicable here, which affects only class members and creates no institutional changes like those in \nRolland. \n7See, e.g.,  Foote v.  Spiegel,  118  F.3d  1416  (10th Cir.  2001) (after two appeals,  plaintiff awarded $1  for  an \nadmittedly illegal strip search); Stewart v.  Lubbock County,  767 F.2d 153, 154, n.2. (5th Cir.  1985)(one plaintiff \nawarded $ I and the other awarded $15,000); Sorenson v. City olNew York, 2000 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 15090 (S.D.N.Y. \n2000)(two plaintiffs awarded $1  each); Polk v.  Montgomery County,  689 F.Supp.  556 (D.  Md.  1988) (plaintiff \nawarded $1 after rejecting a settlement offer of$31,000). \n7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 8 of 16\nshe could have done better at trial because of a particularly strong damages claim had the option to \nopt outS Only one individual opted out (without giving a reason), as opposed to 250 individuals who \nchose to participate in the settlement.' \nSettling now also ensures that class memhers will receive payment much sooner than if the \ncase proceeded to trial and appeal. Receiving prompt payment is especially important in this case, \nwhere a significant portion of the class is  poor and transient. Not only do many class members \npresumably need the money, but as time goes by, it will become increasingly difficult to contact \nthem.,n \n2.  The amount and nature of discovery or evidence \nAs discussed above, the parties reached settlement only after a full discovery period and \nextensive review of Defendants' intake records and a summary judgment decision in favor of the \nplaintiff class. The extensive discovery permitted counsel to carefully assess the value of the case and \nto reach a principled compromise. \n3.  The actual settlement terms and conditions \nThe total value of the settlement is $1,162,468. By any measure, this is more than a token \nrecovery. Participating class  members will receive nearly $3,000  for  filling out a short form and \nmailing it to the claims administrator. These class members will obtain this money without having to \nfind and hire their own lawyers, pay litigation expenses, endure the anxiety of litigation, respond to \n8 See McBean v. City a/New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388 (SD.N.Y. 2006) (\"Individual class members can decide on \ntheir own  where on  the scale of damages they fall,  from  nominal to  substantial.  If on the nominal  side, the \nsettlement's award of $ 750 or $ 1000 is quite attractive; if on the substantial side, the settlement allows individuals \nto opt out and pursue their own claims. \"). \n9 Two other class members submitted claim forms that were defective (one was unsigned, one was signed by \nsomeone other than the class member). Milton Decl. ~ 5. Despite being given notice of these deficiencies and an \nof portu nity to correct them, they have not done so. \n,  See McBean, 233 F.R.D. at 388 (\"The prospect of a trial in this case, with the risk of receiving only nominal \ndamages, and the risk that during protracted litigation class members or become unreachable to collect even a \n8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 9 of 16\ninterrogatories or requests for documents, testify at depositions, and prepare for trials.  Instead of \ngiving up their privacy by filing suit or participating in a damages hearing, they will benefit from the \nanonymity provided by their membership in the class. \nAs  discussed,  class  counsel anticipates  that each participating class  member will  receive \napproximately $2,850. If the Court approves the attorneys' fees and costs requested by class counsel, \nincluding  the  costs  of  claims  administration,  the  estimated  minimum  amount  available  for \ndistribution to class members will be approximately $712,481. All of this money will be divided \namount participating class members. Because of the excellent participation rate, the reverter and cy \npres provisions for undistributed funds do not come into play. \nThe amount class  members will receive wlder the settlement is  well within the range of \nreasonableness for sinillar settlements in this state and nationwide. In Ryall v.  Garvey, No. 05-30017-\nMAP, a case against the Hampshire Sheriff's Department settled in 2007, Judge Ponsor approved a \n$205,000  settlement  for  89  class  members,  30  of whom filed  claims.  Each  participating  class \nmember received approximately  $3,900.\"  In  2009,  a  district  court in  Pennsylvania approved  a \nsettlement that provided for all participating claimants to be granted a pro rata share of a settlement \nfund up to cap of $3,000 per class member; each claimant received approximately $1,400.12 In 2006, \na New York district court approved a settlement granting $750 or $ 1,000 per class member; the \ncourt cited another strip-search class action in which claimants received $1,000 each and another in \nwhich claimants received an average of $3,800 per person.13 \nnominal amount, strongly favors settlement.\"). \n11  In addition to Ryan, Plaintiffs' counsel has settled two other strip search class actions in Massachusetts. Mack v. \nSuffi)lk County.  191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), and Connor v. Plymouth County, 00-10835-RBC. See Declaration \nof Howard Friedman (\"Friedman Dec1.\") 1112. \n12 Boone v. City of Phila .• 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 702-03 (E.D. Pa. 2009). \n13 McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388, 390-91 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). \n9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 10 of 16\n4.  The recommendation and experience of counsel \n\"When the parties' attorneys are experienced and knowledgeable about the facts and claims, \ntheir representations to the court that the settlement provides class relief which is fair, reasonable \nand adequate should be given significant weight.\" Rolland, 191 F.R.D. at 10. \nAs detailed in the declaration of counsel, Plaintiffs' counse! has extensive experience \nlitigating claims of illegal strip searches. Howard Friedman has represented the plaintiffs in more \nthan a dozen strip search cases, including four other class actions and one case that went to trial. He \nhas spoken on strip search law at conferences, lectured on the subject in law schools, and served as a \nconsulting expert for the plaintiffs in other cases alleging illegal strip search policies. Attorney \nFriedman's opinion that the settlement is advantageous to the class weighs in favor of approval. \n5.  The future expense and likely duration of litigation \n\"When comparing the significance of immediate recovery by way of the compromise to the \nmere possibility of relief in the future, after protracted and expensive litigation, there are clearly \nstrong argnments for approving a settlement.\" Rolland, 191 F.R.D. at 10 (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted). Had the parties not settled, it would have been necessary to determine \ndamages for 487 class members. The simple, easy-to-administer distribution formula in this case - all \nclass members receive an equal share of the settlement - avoids the expenditure of resources \nrequired to make hundreds of individual damages determinations. Plaintiffs' counsel has consulted \nwith lawyers from around the country who have settled similar strip search class actions in other \nstates. Experience has shown that requiring individualized determinations of each class member's \n10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 11 of 16\nsubjective experience to determine his or her share of the settlement can be so time consuming and \nexpensive that it harms the class as a whole.!4 \nFurther, as discussed above, many individuals risked getting less money from an \nindividualized determination than they are getting from this settlement, and ail class members faced \nthe prospect that this Court's finding of liability might have been affected if the Supreme Court had \ntaken up the issue of pre-arraignment strip searches before this case had resolved. \n6.  Recommendation of neutral parties, if any \nNo neutral parties have made any recommendations, for or against, approval of the \nsettlement. The parties based the settlement on other settlements in this District, particularly Ryan \nlJ. \nCanJeY, and on the extensive, helpful discussions with the Court. \n7.  The number and nature of objections \nAs descrihed in more detail below, class members received more than adequate notice of the \nsettlement. Although the settlement notice and the claim form informed class memhers of their right \nto object to the settlement, not a single class member out of 487 has done so. \"The lack of any \nobjections from Class memhers is an extremely strong indication that the Settlement is fair.\" in re \nMarsh ERlSA Litig., 265 F.RD. 128, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); Jee aLro 4 Newberg on Class Actions § \n11.41 at 108 (\"If only a smail number of objections are received, that fact can be viewed as indicative \nof the adequacy of the settlement.\"). Further, any class member who felt dissatisfied with the \nsettlement, who felt that he or she suffered atypical hardship as a result of being strip searched, or \nwho, for whatever reason, did not want to participate in the settlement could have opted out of the \n14 Friedman Dec!. 1 22. \n11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 12 of 16\nsettlement. Only 1 of 487 class members did SO.15 When weighed against tbe fact that more than \n50% of the class chose to participate in the settlement, tbis factor strongly supports a finding that \nthe settlement is fair. \n8.  The presence of good faith and the absence of collusion \n\"The storm warnings indicative of collusion are a 'lack of significant discovery and [au] \nextremely expedited settlement of questionable value accompanied by an enormous legal fee.'\"  In re \nLtlpron Mktg. &  Sales Practices Iitlg., 228 F.R.D. 75, 94 (D. Mass. 2005) (citing In \nIn re CMC Pi(k·Up TrNcklc'zlelTank Prods. Iiab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 801 (3d Cir. 1995». No such \nwarnings are present here. As discussed above, the parties reached settlement only after three years \nof litigation and many months of negotiation. The settlement provides a substantial benefit to \nindividual class members. As discussed below, the amounts requested for attorney's fees and for an \nincentive award to the representative are reasonable and are consistent with a\\vards in other cases. \nC.  The Class Received Adequate Notice of Their Rights \nRule 23(e) requires that the Court direct notice \"in a reasonable manner\" of the proposed \nsettlement to all members of the class who would be bound by the settlemcnt. Fed. R.  Civ.  P. \n26(e)(1). OnJuly 12, 2010, this Court approved the parties' notice plan, with certain modifications to \nthe text of the class notice that were incorporated into the final version of the notice. The notice \nplan was a success. More than 50% of the class submitted valid, timely claims showing that the class \nreceived notice. 16 \n15 Milton Dee!. ~ 5. \n16 This is a well above the norm for prisoners' rights class actions, where return rates generally range from 10% to \n30%. See, e.g., Boone v. City of Phila., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 703 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (noting 15% of class members had \nfiled claims); McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)(noting that 4,319 of 40,352 class \nmembers, II %, had filed claims). \n12 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 13 of 16\nBeginning in early August 2010, the Claims Administrator mailed the approved notice and \nclaim form by ftrst class mail postage-prepaid to all potential class members at their last known \naddresses. The last-known addresses were derived from the records of the Franklin County Sheriffs \nDepartment and the Massachusetts Department of Correction. Where it was not clear which address \nwas  more  current,  mailings  were  sent  to  both  addresses.  Additionally,  approximately  13  class \nmembers who were  incarcerated at  the Franklin County Jail  during the notice period received \nindividual notice by hand. Defendants also posted notices in the booking room and in the inmate \nlibrary of the jail. \nLegal notice of the settlement was posted in the Springfteld Republican and Greenfteld \nRecorder on August 3-4, 2010. On July 13, 2010, the Republican published a front-page article about \nthe preliminary approval of the settlement. Also in July 2010, Associated Press released an article \nthat was  published  on over ftfteen  websites, including masslive.com (the  Republican's website), \nCBS3Springfteld.com, Boston.com, and BostonHerald.com. WFCR radio reported on the settlement \nand  included  an  interview  with  attorney  Howard  Friedman.  The  case  website, \nwww.franklincountyjailclass.com. provided notice and other information about the case as well as a \ndownloadable claim form. \nD.  The proposed incentive award to the class representative is reasonable. \nClass counsel requests, and Defendants do not oppose, an incentive payment of $20,000 for \nclass representative Gregory Garvey, Sr. This award is to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a \nresult of bringing this case and for the time he spent in responding to discovery and working with \ncounsel to beneftt the entire class. Mr. Garvey answered individual discovery requests and consulted \nwith counsel throughout the litigation. He ftled two afftdavits in support of summary judgment and \n13 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 68   Filed 12/23/10   Page 14 of 16\nattended the oral argument and preliminary settlement hearing. Mr. Garvey endured a loss of his \npersonal privacy by revealing his name to bring this lawsuit on behalf of the class. \n\"Incentive awards are recognized as serving an important function in promoting class action \nsettlements, particularly where, as here, named plaintiffs actively participated in the litigation.,,17 In \ngranting incentive awards, courts consider the efforts of plaintiffs in pursuing the claims and \"the \nimportant public policy of fostering enforcement of laws and rewarding representative plaintiffs for \nbeing instrumental in obtaining recoveries for persons other than tl,emselves.,,18  The dollar amonnt \nproposed for Mr. Garvey is in line with awards approved by other courts.\" \nAn  incentive payment is  especially  appropriate  for  the  named  class  representative  here \nbecause Mr.  Garvey sacrificed his privacy and subjected himself to embarrassment by admitting \npublicly that he was arrested and forced to SUlP naked as part of his detention in jail.2I1 If ?\"vir. Garvey \nhad 110t eome fOlward, class members would not have known that their rights were violated and \nwould  not  have  sought  or  received  any  compensation  for  their  injury.  Mr.  Garvey  deserves \ncompensation for efforts that helped achieve a substantial benefit for hundreds of people. \n17 In re Lupron(R) Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig. • 228 F.R.D. 75, 98 (D.

The aitorneys' fees and expenses are reasonabie. \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 230') and 54(d)(2), class counsel is filing a separate motion supporting \nits request for attorney's fees  and costs, along with declarations and a memorandmll in support. \nClass counsel requests attorneys' fees of one-third of the total settlement amount, plus litigation and \nclaims administration expenses. The fee request is consistent with the fees awarded to counsel in \nother similar strip search class action cases, and it is  justified by tbe amount of work, skill, and \nexpertise needed to settle tbis case with the results achieved.21 The costs are also reasonable. \nV.

Macdonald and Forbes Byron, and submit \ntheir Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and \nOpposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.   \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nDefendants are seeking Summary Judgment to enter in their favor pursuant to \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56, and request that the Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment be \ndenied.  Defendants claim that the archaic conditions in existence at the Franklin County \nJail (“Jail”) during the class action period, including its layout and age along with other \nfactors, made it legal to strip-search class members, and argue: \n1.  The strip search policy was reasonable under Bell v. Wolfish and its  \n  1\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 2 of 27\nprogeny. \n2.  The factors enunciated in Gilanian v. City of Boston provide a compelling \n reason for a blanket strip search policy. \n3.  The absolute defense of qualified immunity bars an action against the  \nDefendants due to the archaic nature of the Franklin County Jail. \n  The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants’ blanket strip search policy at the Jail from \nMarch 28, 2004, through February 24, 2007, which was changed to a “reasonable suspicion” \nstandard when the new Franklin County House of Corrections (“HOC”) opened, violates the \nFourth Amendment.  The Defendants argue that the archaic nature of the Jail, which was \nbuilt in 1886 and was replaced by the HOC in 2007, presented unusual institutional security \nissues and facilitated the entry of contraband into the facility, and therefore the policy of strip \nsearching all pre-arraignment detainees upon admission was necessary and constitutionally \npermissible.  These unique security concerns at the old Jail created a compelling reason for \nthe adoption of a policy which allowed for strip searches without the need for reasonable \nsuspicion.   \nFACTS \n  The Franklin County Jail was built in 1866.  Defendants’ Local Rule 56.1 Statement \n(“Defendants’ Statement”),  ¶ 1.  It was originally built to house 66 prisoners but, together \nwith a modular addition, eventually housed up to 188.   Id., ¶ 1.  The Jail was built in the \nolder “linear” style (cells lining corridors offering only indirect surveillance); the new HOC \nwas built in the modern “pod” style (two tiers of cells positioned within the perimeter of a \n  2\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 3 of 27\ncommon dayroom, which allows direct supervision of all cells).  Id., ¶ 5.  The cells in the Jail \nwere 48 square feet, compared to 80 square feet at the new HOC.  Id., ¶ 6.  The Jail was used \nby most of the police departments in Franklin County to hold pre-arraignment detainees \npursuant to G.L. c. 126, s. 4, as most local police departments in this rural county had no \nspecific facilities for holding these individuals.  Id., ¶ 13.  The Jail held a wide variety of \nprisoners, including those who were already sentenced (including convicted felons), federal \nprisoners, those awaiting trial, pre-arraignment detainees, and those held in protective \ncustody.  Id., ¶ 4.   The Jail also served as a house of correction, and thus housed convicted \nfelons serving their sentences.  Id., ¶ 4.  As a result of institutional security issues caused by \nthe archaic nature of the Jail, the sheriff adopted a blanket strip search policy for all pre-\narraignment detainees.  Id., ¶ 14.  The policy was intended to protect the safety of both the \ninmates and the correctional officers.  Id., ¶ 14.    The strip search policy was changed to a \n“reasonable suspicion” standard when the new HOC opened, as the new facility solved the \ninstitutional security issues that existed at the old Jail.  Id., ¶ 20.   \nIn 1999, the policy was changed from a blanket strip search policy to a “reasonable \nsuspicion” standard.  Id., ¶ 15.  The policy was changed after the sheriff attended a monthly \nMassachusetts sheriffs’ meeting, and the concern regarding the policy was due to general \nstrip search issues, and not due to any constitutional issues. Id., ¶ 15.  Several individuals, \nincluding Superintendent Byron and a transportation officer, protested to the sheriff that the \nnew policy was compromising institutional security.  Id., ¶ 16.   The policy was then changed \nback to a blanket strip search policy.  Id., ¶ 17.   \n  3\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 4 of 27\nThere were institutional security concerns due to the Jail’s design, its age, and its lack \nof space.  Id., ¶ 14.  Three small cells were used to handle pre-arraignment detainees within a \ncrowded “booking area” or “intake area,” which consisted of a desk area and a computer \nlocated within a few feet of the cells.  Id., ¶ 7.  All cells in the Jail had bars, instead of metal \ndoors with windows as in the new facility, and as a result, prisoners could reach out from the \ncells, leading to security and contraband problems.  Id., ¶ 6.  There was the potential for pre-\narraignment detainee contact with the general prison population if space was not available in \nthe holding cells.  Id., ¶ 9, 23.  Contraband could easily be passed around by inmates.  Id., ¶ \n6.  Although the record does not indicate a major contraband problem, there are some \ndocumented instances of contraband being confiscated from pre-arraignment detainees \nduring the class period.  Id., ¶ 24-28.  In addition, contraband confiscated from detainees was \nnot always documented or reported by correctional officers as required by policy.  Id., ¶ 25-\n27.   \nSTRIP SEARCH FACTORS \n  The Defendants state that the following factors required the imposition of a blanket \nstrip search policy for all pre-arraignment detainees at the Jail during the class period: \nInstitutional Security Issues \n  The Jail was built in 1886.  As a result, it was not comparable to a modern facility. \n The Jail was built in the older “linear” style (cells lining corridors offering only indirect \nsurveillance); the new HOC was built in the modern “pod” style (two tiers of cells \npositioned within the perimeter of a common dayroom, which allows direct supervision of \n  4\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 5 of 27\nall cells).  The archaic condition of the Jail resulted in various security and contraband \nissues.  The linear style of the jail also created security issues for both inmates and Jail \npersonnel. \nBooking Area \n  The Jail did not have cells designed specifically for pre-arraignment detainees.  \nAfter Sheriff Macdonald took office, a booking area was constructed in the Jail in order to \nhold people who had been arrested by the local police departments and brought to the Jail. \n The space in the booking area was extremely tight, as someone in a jail cell could reach \nover to the booking desk and grab whatever items were placed on the desk. \nContraband \n  A review of the files of the approximately 900 pre-arraignment detainees that were \nbrought into the Jail during the class period shows five instances of contraband being \nfound on pre-arraignment detainees during strip searches.   \n  Although when contraband was found it was to be reported to the shift \ncommander, in practice contraband was not always reported.  Therefore, the contraband \nproblem was larger than indicated by the reports. \nIntermingling \n  Pre-arraignment detainees would be kept overnight at the Jail, and there was a \npotential for pre-arraignment detainee contact with the general Jail population.  Once a \npre-arraignment detainee was booked, he or she would be placed into one of the three \ncells in the booking area until being taken upstairs to the jail block, to be housed with the \n  5\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 6 of 27\ngeneral population.  The three cells in the booking area were used for housing pre-\narraignment detainees overnight when there were no empty cells in the main block; \notherwise, they would be kept open for new intakes.  It was therefore impossible to \nseparate the pre-arraignment detainees from the other inmates. \nOvercapacity \nThe Jail was built in 1866.  It was originally built to house 66 prisoners but, \ntogether with a modular addition that was built to house approximately 60, the Jail \neventually housed up to 188.  As a result, the Jail was well over design capacity.  The \ndesign capacity for the new HOC is 288.  The cells in the Jail were 48 square feet, \ncompared to 80 square feet at the new HOC.     \nMultipurpose Jail \nThe Jail served as a multipurpose facility, in that it housed a wide variety of \nindividuals, from those held in protective custody to felons serving their sentences, and \nalso held both male and female inmates.  Multipurpose facilities are more volatile than are \nregular county jails.        \nUnavailability of Alternatives \nThe three cells in the booking area were only used for housing pre-arraignment \ndetainees overnight when there were no empty cells in the main block; otherwise, they \nwould be kept open for new intakes.  Due to space limitations in the Jail, there was no \nplace to keep the records other than in one of the jail cells next to the records office.  As a \nresult, these cells could not be used for pre-arraignment detainees.  Pre-arraignment \n  6\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 7 of 27\ndetainees could not be housed in the DDU (disciplinary unit) either, since the two cells \nwere frequently occupied. \nG.L. c. 126, s. 4 \n  G.L. c. 126, s. 4 provides: \nJails shall be used for the detention of persons charged with crime and committed \nfor trial, committed to secure their attendance as witnesses upon the trial of \ncriminal causes, committed pursuant to a sentence upon conviction of crime or for \nany cause authorized by law, or detained or committed by the courts of the United \nStates. Jails may also be used for the detention of persons arrested without a \nwarrant and not admitted to bail pending appearance before the district court, \nprovided that no adequately equipped lock-up established in accordance with the \nprovisions of section thirty-four of chapter forty is available for the detention of \nsuch person.  \n \n  G.L. c. 126, s. 4. \nUnder this statute, the FCSO housed pre-arraignment detainees brought to the Jail \nduring the evening and overnight by local police departments.  The Jail was used by \napproximately 22 of the 26 city and town police departments in Franklin County to hold \npre-arraignment detainees, as most local police departments in this rural county had no \navailable facilities for holding these individuals overnight.  The FCSO was not \nreimbursed by local towns for keeping detainees.  As a result of the statute permitting \njails to hold detainees where local lockups are unavailable, the Jail accepted numerous \npre-arraignment detainees.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ CROSS-MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nARGUMENT \n  7\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 8 of 27\nI.  The strip search policy was reasonable under Bell and its progeny\n  \n The searches conducted pursuant to the policy, including those of the Plaintiff, \nwere reasonable and were, therefore, constitutional.   The United States Constitution \nforbids only unreasonable searches.  See U.S. CONST. amend IV.  Where searches are \nnot unreasonable, the searches do not violate the United States Constitution.  Given that \nthe searches conducted pursuant to the policy were reasonable as a matter of law, \njudgment should enter for Defendants. \nA.  Bell v. Wolfish   \n \nUnder the balancing test first enunciated by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520 (1979), “[b]oth convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain \nconstitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.”  Id. at 545.  The “Bell balancing test” \nrequires courts to examine the following: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise  \ndefinition or mechanical application.   In each case, it requires a balancing of the  \nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the  \nsearch entails.   Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the  \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in  \nwhich it is conducted. \n \nId. at 559. \n \n  B.  Bell’s progeny in the First Circuit and District of Massachusetts   \nThe following chronology of strip search cases within the First Circuit and the \nUnited States District Court in Massachusetts illustrates how the case law in strip search \n  8\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 9 of 27\ncases has evolved since Bell: \n  1.  Arruda v. Fair\n  In Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983), a prison’s policy of strip searching \ninmates of a security unit when they were entering or leaving a prison law library or \ninfirmary was upheld.   In writing for the court, Judge Breyer found that “Wolfish \ncautions us to be most hesitant to overturn prison administrators’ good faith judgments.”  \nId. at 887. \n2.  Swain v. Spinney \n \nThe “reasonable suspicion” standard to be applied in strip search cases was first \nenunciated by the First Circuit in 1997 in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997). \nThis case concerned a female detainee who was strip searched after she was arrested \nalong with her boyfriend, who had been arrested on theft and drug charges.  The detainee \nin this case was arrested for a minor offense, searched at a local jail, and was \nsubsequently held in a cell with no risk of contact with other prisoners.  Id. at 8.  In \napplying the Bell test in the context of misdemeanor detainees, the First Circuit concluded \nthat “[s]trip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a reasonable \nsuspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.”  Id. at 7; see also Wood \nv. Hancock County, 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir.2003); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d \n107, 113 (1st Cir.2001); Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12-13 (1st Cir.2000).  \nThe application of this standard, however, has gone through numerous permutations since \nSwain was decided.\n  9\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 10 of 27\n3.  Roberts v. Rhode Island\nThe plaintiff in Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2001), challenged a \npolicy of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections that required all males committed \nto state prison to be subjected to a strip search and visual cavity search.  The First Circuit \nfound that the institutional concerns in Roberts fell somewhere between Swain (local jail, \nno risk of prisoner contact) and those enunciated in Arruda (maximum security prison \nwith a history of contraband problems) and Bell, and ultimately held the policy \nunconstitutional with respect to inmates charged with “only a misdemeanor involving \nminor offenses or traffic violations.”  Id. at 112.   The court also held that Fourth \nAmendment rights must be balanced against the “legitimate goals and policies of the \npenal institution, and the need of the institution to maintain security.”  Id. at 110 (citing \nBell, 441 U.S. at 546).  To determine whether the government has a compelling reason \nand, therefore, does not need reasonable suspicion, courts have considered, among other \nthings, the type of individual being searched, the history of contraband problems, the \ncharacteristics and dangerousness of the jail or prison population, and questions about \ncommingling.  Id. at 111-113; see also Gilanian, 431 F.Supp.3d at 176.     \n4.  Ford v. City of Boston\nJudge Gertner in Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131 (D.Mass.2001) found \nthat Boston’s policy of performing strip searches without reasonable suspicion on all \nfemale city arrestees was unconstitutional as to “all class members charged with felonies \nor misdemeanors involving neither violence nor drugs, and class members held on default \n  10\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 11 of 27\nwarrants for similar offenses.” Id. at 134.  Judge Gertner also found that one of the major \nfoundations for the institutional security concerns supporting the city’s strip search \npolicy, to keep contraband out of the city’s jails, was not supported by the evidence, as \nonly 5 of the female arrestees possessed contraband out of 8,000 searched.  Ford has not \nbeen followed.  See also  DeToledo v. Suffolk, 379 F.Supp.2d 138, 148 (D.Mass.2005), \ndiscussed below. \n5.  Savard v. Rhode Island\nSavard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23 (1st Cir.2003) involved a policy of strip \nsearching individuals arrested for non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanors detained in \na single, all-purpose penitentiary which housed “an array of prisoners ranging from newly \nsentenced felons to convicts under protective custody to pretrial detainees to arrestees.   \nAll of these individuals, except for detainees held in protective custody, were \ncommingled while in various parts of the intake facilities.”  Id. at 26.  The court noted \nthat “[t]here are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation \n[such as in Swain] and introducing an arrestee into the general population of a maximum \nsecurity prison.”  Id. at 29. \nThe First Circuit stated in Savard that  \n“the case law emphasizes that prison regulations may constitutionally impinge \nupon fundamental rights so long as such regulations are reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests.   [citations omitted]. Within the walls of a \nmaximum security prison, the need to preserve internal security is compelling.  \n[citations omitted]  We think it follows that Rhode Island correctional officials \nreasonably could have regarded the stark differences between local lockups and \nmaximum security prisons as pivotal in deciding whether a particular security-\noriented policy was necessary.”   \n  11\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 12 of 27\n \nId. at 30-31.   \nThe court in Savard noted differences between the facts in this case and the facts in \ntwo prior cases in the line of strip search decisions, Swain and Arruda.  The plaintiff in \nSwain was held in virtual isolation after her arrest; therefore, the security concerns were \nminimal.  “There are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual \nisolation and introducing an arrestee into the general population.”  Id. at 29.  Arruda \nconcerned a blanket strip search policy which was upheld in a case involving strip \nsearches of convicted felons, not detainees arrested for misdemeanors as in Savard.  Id. at \n30.   \nIn holding that qualified immunity applied in Savard, the court stated that  \n“there is a distinction for qualified immunity purposes between an unconstitutional \nbut objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act.  Saucier, 533 \nU.S. at 206, 121 S.Ct. 2151; Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034.  Here, the \nlack of any direct precedent and the undulating contours of the law during the \nrelevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional violation was not \nobvious; the defendants reasonably could have thought, prior to Roberts I, that \nthere was room in the law for the [correctional institution’s] strip search policy.”  \n  \nId. at 32.   \nIn holding for the Defendants, however, the court noted that the claimed violations \noccurred before the Roberts decisions, by which the blanket strip policy would have been \nfound unconstitutional.  However, the court also acknowledged that the Roberts decision \nwas limited to non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors.  Savard, 338 F.3d at 27. \n6.  DeToledo v. Suffolk\nThe Plaintiff in DeToledo v. Suffolk, 379 F.Supp.2d 138 (D.Mass.2005), was a \n  12\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 13 of 27\nvisitor to a jail who was arrested and strip searched due to a felony warrant which had \nbeen recalled, and which the jail administrators incorrectly believed was still valid.  The \ncourt found that whether “Swain settled the strip search issue in this Circuit with respect \nto pretrial detainees, as Judge Gertner thought in Ford, is thrown into doubt by subsequent \nFirst Circuit cases.”  Id. at 148.   “In Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113, the Court of Appeals found \na blanket strip search policy unconstitutional insofar as it applied to minor offenses.   The \ncourt defined ‘minor offenses’ as ‘misdemeanors involving minor offenses or traffic \nviolations.’  Id. at 112  (emphasis added).”  Id. at 149, fn. 15. \nThe court in DeToledo revisited the Swain versus Arruda argument: \n“In the end, we recognize that both Swain and Arruda offer valuable insights, but \nthat neither is a very exact match.   While Swain makes clear that strip searches \nought not lightly to be indulged, the factual context of the case presented rather \nminimal security concerns.   And while Arruda makes clear that institutional \nsecurity needs may require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting, that \ncase dealt not with persons arrested for relatively innocuous misdemeanors, but, \nrather, with hardened criminals.   So long as the facts in these cases are \ndistinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand - and we believe that they are - \nthen neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for purposes of \na qualified immunity determination in the instant case.” \n \n  Id. at 148 (emphasis added). \n \n7.  Doe v. Preston\nIn Doe v. Preston, 472 F.Supp.2d 16 (D.Mass.2007), the Department of Youth \nServices was sued for violating a juvenile detainee’s constitutional rights by allegedly \nsubjecting her to strip searches under a policy allowing such searches without reasonable \nsuspicion of possession of contraband.  The court held that the correctional officials were \nentitled to qualified immunity, as the law on the subject was not clearly established in the \n  13\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 14 of 27\ncontext of a juvenile facility.   \nDoe is also of note due to the court’s discussion of the application of the Bell \nreasonableness test: \nThe First Circuit has applied this test to uphold strip searches of inmates housed \nwithin a security unit in a state correctional institution, Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d \n886 (1st Cir.1983).  The same test was used to find unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment searches that were conducted without reasonable suspicion that \ncontraband was being concealed … by persons arrested for minor, non-violent \noffenses who were being detained pending arraignment either at a police station, \nMiller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2000), and Swain v. Spinney, 117 \nF.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997), or at a detention facility, Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d \n107 (1st Cir.2001).  In each case, the court of appeals gave consideration to the \nvarious competing interests as they appeared in the particular circumstances of the \ncase at hand, just as the Bell v. Wolfish test requires. \n \nId. at 22.   \n \nC.  Applying the Bell test to the searches at issue here result in the conclusion  \n  that the searches were reasonable  \n \nUnreasonable search and seizure must be balanced against the promotion of \nlegitimate governmental interests.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 545.  These interests include the \n“legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution, and the need of the institution to \nmaintain security.”  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 546).  The \ninstitution “may provide a compelling reason for a warrantless strip search absent \nreasonable suspicion” to advance the legitimate need for institutional security.  Id. at 110. \n   This court must examine the components of the Bell balancing test to determine \nwhether the policy was constitutional.  This court must therefore consider the scope of the \nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it was conducted, the justification for initiating \nit, and the place in which it was conducted.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. \n  14\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 15 of 27\n1.  The scope of the particular intrusion  \n \nA strip search of the type that was allowed by the Jail’s policy “instinctively [gives \nthe Court] … pause.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558.  The court should examine the remaining \nthree components to determine the policy’s constitutionality.  \n2.  The manner in which it was conducted and the place in  \nwhich it was conducted \n \nThere were no issues raised by the Plaintiff as to whether the manner in which the \nsearches were conducted (no allegation that the visual body search itself was conducted \nunlawfully) or the place in which the searches occurred (in private in one of the holding \ncells) were unconstitutional.  This leaves the court to analyze the justification put forth by \nthe Defendants to implement the policy. \n3.  The justification for initiating the search \nThe Defendants submit numerous reasons relating to the archaic Jail conditions, as \nset forth in the Factors section of this Memorandum, as reasons for implementing the \nblanket strip search policy.  These include:  institutional security issues; the condition of \nthe booking area; contraband issues; intermingling; overcapacity issues; the multipurpose \nJail facility; unavailability of alternatives for housing pre-arraignment detainees; and the \ninterplay of G.L. c. 126, s. 4 and the lack of local lockups in rural Franklin County.  \nThese are sufficient justifications to tip the balance of the Bell test in favor of the \nDefendants.   Further, once the HOC opened, it solved many of the institutional security \nproblems that existed at the Jail, and the policy was immediately changed.   \n \n  15\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 16 of 27\nII.  The factors enunciated in the Gilanian case provide a “compelling reason” for \na blanket strip search policy, and thus a complete defense to the Plaintiff’s \nclaims \n \nThe “undulating contours” of strip search cases in the First Circuit and Federal \ncourts in Massachusetts preceding and during the class period took yet another sharp turn \nin Gilanian, in which Judge Gertner retreated from the rigid analysis that she set forth in \nFord, in holding that “[i]f corrections personnel lack particularized, individualized \nreasonable suspicion, they may nevertheless conduct a strip-search pursuant to a blanket \nsearch policy if that policy is properly justified by other considerations.”  Id. at 176.    \n Gilanian enumerated various factors that a court must consider in determining \nwhether the government has a compelling reason to conduct a strip search without the \nneed for reasonable suspicion.  In determining whether a blanket strip search is justified, \ncourts may consider, among other things, “the type of crime with which a group of \ninmates is charged, the institution’s history of contraband and safety problems, the \nexistence or lack of less restrictive alternative policies, the characteristics and \ndangerousness of the jail or prison population, and the questions of whether the inmates \nto be searched have mingled with the general jail population or had contact with outside \nvisitors.”  Id. at 176.   Each Gilanian factor is addressed separately below. \nA.   Gilanian factors\n1.  Type of crimes \nIn Roberts, the First Circuit, citing Swain, ruled that detainees held in local jails \n  16\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 17 of 27\nfor minor offenses1 cannot be strip searched without reasonable suspicion.2  It seems clear \nthat, in addressing the Gilanian factors, only those detainees charged with certain \nmisdemeanors and strip searched at the Jail would fall within the protected class.  The \nFirst Circuit has not fully defined what type of misdemeanors are included, aside from \n“minor offenses and traffic violations” (Roberts) and “non-violent, non-drug related \nmisdemeanors” (Savard).  (Ford, a Massachusetts District Court case, additionally \nincludes as a protected class “all class members charged with felonies or misdemeanors \ninvolving neither violence nor drugs, and class members held on default warrants for \nsimilar offenses,” id. at 134, but, as discussed above, no other court has adopted the \nholding in Ford.) \n2.  Contraband and safety problems \nThe second Gilanian factor is “the institution’s history of contraband and safety  \nproblems.”  The existence of contraband and safety issues were the driving forces \nbehind the implementation of the FCSO’s blanket strip search policy.   \na.  Contraband\nOf the approximately 900 pre-arraignment detainee files reviewed at the FCSO, \nthere were five incident reports of contraband found on detainees during strip searches. 3\n                                                 \n1 The Court in Roberts defined “minor offenses” merely as “misdemeanors involving minor offenses or traffic \nviolations.”  Id. at 112. \n2 But note:  “The arrestee in Swain was held in isolation in a temporary holding facility where there was no risk of \ncontact with other prisoners. That fact, and the difference in magnitude between security concerns in a holding cell \nand those in a prison, led an equally divided en banc Court in Savard to conclude that neither Swain (nor Arruda) \ngave definitive guidance with respect to pretrial detainees.”  DeToledo, 379 F.Supp.2d at 148. \n \n3 The Plaintiff makes much of the fact that only one of the instances of contraband was found as a result of a strip \nsearch.  The issue, however, is whether contraband is being brought into the institution. \n  17\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 18 of 27\nThis is only the contraband that was documented during the class period; there was other \ncontraband found during this time period that was not properly documented.   \nAlthough the Plaintiff’s argument in its Memorandum relies heavily on the alleged \nlack of contraband found during strip searches at the Jail, it is a substantially higher ratio \nthan in Ford (5 instances of contraband found on nearly 8,000 detainees) – indeed, almost \na tenfold increase.  \n    b.  Safety\nIssues concerning the safety of detainees and Jail personnel also drove the \nimplementation of the Jail’s strip search policy, as set forth in the Factors section of this \nMemorandum.     \n3.  Characteristics and dangerousness of the jail\nThe First Circuit in Roberts found that a strip search performed on an arrestee for a \nnonviolent crime was unconstitutional absent particularized suspicion.  The defendant \nRhode Island argued that the heightened security concerns of the intake facility, a \nmaximum security prison where pretrial detainees were held prior to trial and sentencing, \nrequired a strip search of all detainees, an argument that the court rejected. \nThe holding in Roberts was further defined in Savard, where the court held that \n“the population of a maximum security prison tends to be much more volatile and much \nless transient than that of a county jail.”  Savard, 338 F.3d at 31. \nThe courts have generally held that the higher the security level, the more \ndangerous the facility, and consequently the greater the institutional security concerns.  \n  18\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 19 of 27\nAlthough the Jail was a county institution, it served as a multipurpose facility, housing a \nvariety of inmates, from those in protective custody to federal prisoners to felons serving \nsentences in the house block.  Therefore, its population was much more volatile than the \ntypical county jail noted in Savard.  Further, the antiquated facility significantly raised the \nlevel of danger to both inmates and staff. \n4.  The existence or lack of less restrictive alternative policies\nThe antiquated nature of the Jail and its overcapacity problem did not leave any \nalternative but to allow intermingling of inmates and pre-arraignment detainees.  It also \ninhibited correctional officers’ capability to oversee the inmates.  The ability of inmates \nto reach out of their cells through the bars posed both a security risk and promoted \ncontraband circulation.  \nThe differences between the old and new institutions are remarkable.  The linear \nlayout and open bars of the old Jail inhibited officer supervision and allowed contact both \nbetween the cells themselves and between the cells and anyone walking through the \nhallways, which promoted the exchange of contraband and increase security risks to \ninmates and officers.  The linear design inhibited correctional officers’ ability to oversee \ninmates.  Thus, the Jail could be as dangerous as a maximum security prison, and makes \nthe penological interests addressed by a blanket strip search policy more compelling. \n5.  Intermingling\nPre-arraignment detainees were intermingled with the general population in the \nJail, which created additional security problems.  The court in Roberts held that \n  19\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 20 of 27\nintermingling alone will not justify a strip search without reasonable suspicion, as \ncommingling was “potentially alterable.”  Due to the antiquated condition of the Jail, \nhowever, the commingling situation was unalterable, as there was no real alternative for \nseparating detainees from inmates, or for housing pre-arraignment detainees elsewhere in \nthe facility.   \n  B.  Conclusion\nBased on the above analysis of the Gilanian factors, the Defendants had a  \ncompelling reason to adopt a policy which allowed for strip searches at the Jail without \nthe need for reasonable suspicion. \n \nIII.  The absolute defense of qualified immunity bars an action against the \nDefendants due to the archaic nature of the Franklin County Jail \n \n“The law does not expect a public official, faced with the need to make an \nobjectively reasonable real-world judgment, to anticipate precisely the legal \nconclusions that will be reached by a panel of federal appellate judges after \nbriefing, arguments, and full-fledged review.... [T]he lack of any direct precedent \nand the undulating contours of the law during the relevant period combine to \npersuade us that the constitutional violation was not obvious; the defendants \nreasonably could have thought … that there was room in the law for the \n[defendants'] strip search policy.”  \n \nSavard, 338 F.3d at 32. \n \nIn order to determine whether qualified immunity applies in the instant matter, the \ncourt must assess whether the law was clearly established when the strip search policy \nwas in place.  \nA.  Summary of the law\n  20\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 21 of 27\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity “protects public officials from the specter of \ndamages liability for judgment calls made in a legally uncertain environment.\" Ryder v. \nUnited States, 515 U.S. 177, 185 (1995).   In the line of cases involving strip searches, \ncourts have held that \"[t]he doctrine of qualified immunity protects public officials from \ncivil liability 'insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’”  Cox v. Hainey, \n391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  \nA plaintiff in a §1983 case must demonstrate that State officials, when sued in their \nindividual capacities, violated the plaintiff's \"clearly established rights\" in order to \novercome qualified immunity.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-819, 102 S.Ct. \n2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); O'Malley v. Sheriff of Worcester County, 415 Mass. 132, \n142 (1993).    \nThe First Circuit applies a three step analysis to determine whether qualified \nimmunity applies: \n(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional \nright; (2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action \nor inaction; and (3) if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative, \nwhether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action \ntaken violated that clearly established constitutional right.  Wilson v. City of \nBoston, 421 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 \nF.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir.2001)). \n \nMarcello v. Maine, 489 F.Supp.2d 70, 80 (D.Me.2007). \n \nOf particular interest in this analysis is the second prong, “whether the right was  \nclearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction”:   \n  21\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 22 of 27\nA government official making a policy decision is entitled to qualified immunity if \nthe law was not clearly established at the time the determination was made.   If the \nlaw is unclear, “an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate \nsubsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly be said to ‘know’ that the law \nforbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.”  Id.  In order to make a \ndetermination whether that right was clearly established at the time it was violated, \na \"court must canvass controlling authority in its own jurisdiction and, if none \nexists, attempt to fathom whether there is a consensus of persuasive authority \nelsewhere.\"  Savard v. R.I., 338 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2003).  Accord Wilson v. \nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999); Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104, 116 (1st Cir.1999).  \nIf the case law is sufficiently unsettled, and the Court cannot conclude that there is \na consensus of authority as to a prisoner's right, the right is not clearly established \nand defendants are immune from claims for damages.  Id.  \n \n  Tardiff v. Knox County, 397 F.Supp.2d 115, 140 (D.Me.2005) (emphasis added).4\n  B.  The scope of the right in this case was not clearly established\nThe presence of a balancing test is a crucial factor indicating that the scope of the \nright in this case was not clearly established.  Here, a balancing test must be employed in \norder to determine if a policy or practice is unreasonable and, therefore, violates the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Multiple circuits have recognized \nthat only in the most unusual circumstances will it be fair to say that the scope of a right \nis clearly established where the assessment of that right is subject to a balancing test.  The \nFirst Circuit in Frazier v. Bailey, 957 F.2d 920 (1st Cir. 1992), stated: \n[i]f the existence of a right or the degree of protection it warrants in a \nparticular context is subject to a balancing test, the right can rarely be \nconsidered “clearly established,” at least in the absence of closely \ncorresponding factual and legal precedent.  \nId. at 931, quoting Myers v. Morris, 810 F.2d 1437, 1462 (8th Cir. 1987), \ncert. denied, 484 U.S. 828 (1987). \n \n  22\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 23 of 27\nAs  there  are  no  First  Circuit  decisions  (or  decisions  from  any  other  circuits) \nconcerning blanket strip search policies imposed due to the archaic nature of a jail, the  \nDefendants have qualified immunity as to all of the potential class action plaintiffs due to \ntheir reasonable belief that the condition of the jail necessitated a blanket strip search policy. \n Underlying Sheriff Macdonald’s belief that the strip search policy was specifically related to \nthe conditions at the Jail was his decision to begin working to secure funds to build a new \nfacility after the blanket strip search policy was reinstated in 1999, in part to resolve \ninstitutional  security  issues  surrounding  pre-arraignment  detainees  and  the  statutory \nobligation imposed by G.L. c. 126, s. 4.  In addition, his decision to change the policy to a \n“reasonable suspicion” standard immediately upon the opening of the new, state-of-the-art \nHOC evidences that the institutional security problems had been the driving force behind the \nold policy. \nThe detainees’ rights were not clearly established during the applicable class \n period because the antiquated jail presented unusual security concerns.  There is no \n“clearly established” law forbidding a blanket strip search policy in a unique facility like \nthe Jail.   \nFurther, the “undulating contours” of the law with respect to the constitutionality \nof strip searches in penal institutions prior to and during the class action period, as \ndiscussed in Section I of this Memorandum, evidences that there was no “clearly \nestablished” law during this time period.  “If the case law is sufficiently unsettled, and the \n                                                                                                                                                             \n4 Plaintiff’s counsel in the present matter represented the class in Tardiff. \n  23\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 24 of 27\nCourt cannot conclude that there is a consensus of authority as to a prisoner's right, the \nright is not clearly established and defendants are immune from claims for damages.”   \nSavard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2003).  Indeed, there are numerous cases \nholding that, where the defendants did not know that conducting blanket strip searches \nwas unconstitutional due to institutional security concerns, the law was not clearly \nestablished and qualified immunity applied.  See Savard (Court held defendant could not \nhave known strip search policy (policy of strip searching individuals arrested for non-\nviolent, non-drug related misdemeanors detained in a penitentiary housing an array of \nprisoners who were commingled) was unconstitutional); DeToledo (“So long as the facts \nin these cases are distinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand - and we believe that \nthey are - then neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for purposes \nof a qualified immunity determination in the instant case.”); and Doe (correctional \nofficials were entitled to qualified immunity in lawsuit brought by juvenile detainee \nallegedly subjected to strip searches under policy allowing such searches without \nreasonable suspicion of possession of contraband, as the law on the subject was not \nclearly established in the context of a juvenile facility).  \nWhether the “reasonable suspicion” standard should be applied with respect to  \ndetainees comingled in an archaic jail has not been clearly established.  It would have \nbeen difficult, given the conditions in existence at the Jail prior to and during the class \nperiod, for the Defendants to determine exactly what the Constitution required in the way \nof a proper strip search policy at the Jail.  The Defendants erred on the side of \n  24\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 25 of 27\ninstitutional safety.  As a result, they are entitled to qualified immunity “insofar as their \nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nreasonable person would have known.”  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \nARGUMENT \nIn Bell, the primary justification offered by the Supreme Court for initiating strip \nsearches without reasonable suspicion was the need to discover and confiscate \ncontraband.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  The Supreme Court determined that this justification \nwas sufficient to validate that search policy.  The justification offered in Arruda was to \npreclude or lessen the introduction of contraband into the prison.  Arruda, 710 F.2d at \n887-888.  There, the court determined that the justification was sufficient to make the \npolicy reasonable.  In Swain, the justifications put forward were institutional security and \nensuring that an arrestee is not concealing contraband or weapons.  Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.  \nIn Roberts, the justification offered was “a concern for institutional security.”  Roberts, \n239 F.3d at 110-111.  In both Swain and Roberts, while recognizing the legitimacy of the \njustifications offered, the courts found that there were not sufficient facts to render the \npolicies reasonable.   \nAddressing the institutional security concern in Roberts, the court recognized that \n“[i]ntermingling of inmates is a serious concern that weighs in favor of the \nreasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search,” but was not “in itself, dispositive of \n  25\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 38   Filed 12/22/08   Page 26 of 27\nthe reasonableness of the search.”  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112-113.  Here, unlike in Roberts, \nintermingling is one, but not the only, concern justifying the searches at issue.  Id. at 112. \n  Declaring that the searches conducted under the policy at issue in the instant case \nwere reasonable is consistent with the reasoning in Roberts.  The court’s holding in that \ncase requiring individualized reasonable suspicion for a strip search relied on the fact that \nthe plaintiffs  faced misdemeanor or minor offense charges.  Id. at 112.  In keeping with \nthis reasoning, routine searches of individuals charged with felonies, or charged with \nmisdemeanors involving weapons, drugs, or violence, are reasonable. \nIn the instant matter, the Defendants submitted evidence of numerous reasons for \nthe policy, each of which is discussed previously in this Memorandum.  Further, the \npolicy was changed once the HOC opened, as the new facility solved many of the serious \nproblems that existed at the Jail.  The combination of these factors should result in the \nconclusion that the strip search policy was reasonable.  As set forth above, the \njustifications for the Policy in this case far exceed any of the justifications offered in Bell, \nArruda, Swain or Roberts.   \n \nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE, Defendants request this Honorable Court to grant summary judgment \nin their favor, and deny the Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nFREDERICK B.

This is a civil rights class action for money damages against Franklin County Sheriff\nFrederick B. Macdonald and Special Sheriff Superintendent Forbes Byron in their individual\ncapacities for routine unconstitutional strip searches on intake of pre-arraignment detainees at the\nFranklin County Jail and House of Correction (“Franklin County Jail”). On November 29, 2006,\nnamed plaintiff Gregory Garvey Sr. was involved in a car accident in Whately, Massachusetts. An\nofficer who responded to the scene notified Mr. Garvey that his right to drive in Massachusetts had\nbeen suspended for failure to pay excise taxes. The officer told Mr. Garvey that he would receive a\nnotice of the date to appear in court by mail.\n2.  Mr. Garvey paid the outstanding excise tax. He never received a notice from the\ncourt. At approximately 11:00 pm on January 30, 2007, Sunderland police officers arrived at Mr.\nGarvey’s home and arrested him on a default warrant for failure to appear in court earlier that day\non the charge of operating on a suspended driver’s license. The officers brought Mr. Garvey to the\nFranklin County Jail where he was held until he could appear in court the next morning.\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 2 of 8(cid:10)\n3.  At the jail, correctional officers strip searched Mr. Garvey based on a written policy\nof the Sheriff that required a strip search on admission to the facility. The officers ordered Mr.\nGarvey to strip naked, bend over and spread his buttocks, to allow a corrections officer to visually\ninspect his nude body, including his genitals. Before the jail officers took Mr. Garvey to court, they\nstrip searched him a second time. When Mr. Garvey appeared in court the next morning, the court\ndismissed the charges against him. Mr. Garvey felt humiliated, degraded and violated as a result of\nthe strip searches. \n4.  The named plaintiff Gregory Garvey Sr., seeks to represent a class of all people strip\nsearched after March 28, 2004, without individualized reasonable suspicion at the Franklin County\nJail due to the policies or practices of the defendant Franklin County Sheriff.\n5.  On  information  and  belief,  hundreds  of  people  have  been  subjected to\nunconstitutional strip searches upon admission to the Franklin County Jail.\nJURISDICTION\n6.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§1983 and 1988 and the Fourth, Fifth,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Jurisdiction is founded upon\n28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343.\nPARTIES\n7.  Named plaintiff Gregory Garvey Sr. was at all times relevant to this complaint a\nresident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n8.  Defendant Frederick B. Macdonald was at all times relevant to this complaint, a\nresident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He has been the Sheriff of Franklin County since\nJanuary 6, 1993. He is sued in his individual capacity for actions he took under color of law.\n-2-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 3 of 8(cid:10)\n9.  Defendant Forbes Byron was at all times relevant to this complaint a resident of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts and the Special Sheriff Superintendent responsible for operation\nof the Franklin County. He is sued in his individual capacity for actions he took under color of law.\nFACTS\n10.  When their home in Mississippi was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, Gregory\nGarvey, his wife Diana Garvey, and his daughter relocated to Massachusetts.\n11.  In late November 2006, Mr. Garvey was involved in a motor vehicle accident in\nWhately, Massachusetts.\n12.  A Whately police officer arrived at the scene of the accident. The officer ran Mr.\nGarvey’s Mississippi driver’s license through his computer. He discovered that Mr. Garvey’s right\nto operate a motor vehicle in Massachusetts had been suspended because he had not paid a\nMassachusetts excise tax years earlier when he had previously lived in Massachusetts.\n13.  The officer gave Mr. Garvey a motor vehicle citation and told him that he would\nreceive a notice of a court date in the mail. Mr. Garvey did not receive notice of a court date.\n14.  On Tuesday, January 30, 2007, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Sunderland police\nofficers arrived at Mr. Garvey’s home and placed him under arrest for failure to appear in court\nearlier that day.\n15.  After the arrest, the police officers took Mr. Garvey to the Sunderland Police Station\nwhere he was fingerprinted and processed. Then Sunderland police officers took him to the Franklin\nCounty Jail in Greenfield, Massachusetts to be held until he could appear in court the next morning.\n16.  It was the practice of police officers in Sunderland and other police departments in\nFranklin County to bring pre-arraignment detainees to the Franklin County Jail to be held before\ntheir first court appearance. \n-3-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 4 of 8(cid:10)\n17.  As Sheriff, Frederick B. Macdonald was responsible for all of the policies of the\nFranklin County Sheriff’s Department, including the strip search policies of the Franklin County Jail.\nHis job responsibilities included assuring that the polices and practices of the jail complied with the\nConstitution.\n18.  As the Special Sheriff and Superintendent of the Franklin County Jail, Forbes Byron\nwas responsible for the policies of the Jail including the strip search policies. His job responsibilities\nincluded assuring that the polices and practices of the jail complied with the Constitution.\n19.  Sheriff Macdonald issued and Special Sheriff Byron implemented General Order 506\nwhich, up until February 25, 2007, mandated that all detainees except those in protective custody be\nstrip searched on admission to the jail and again before leaving the jail to go to court.\n20.  During the admission procedure at the Franklin County Jail, a correctional officer\nordered Mr. Garvey to remove all of his clothing and submit to a strip search.\n21.  Mr. Garvey complied with the request. He removed his clothing and followed the\norders of the correctional officer to bend and spread the cheeks of his buttocks. The corrections\nofficer told Mr. Garvey, “We have to watch you do it. Bend over. Spread your cheeks.” \n22.  The officer visually inspected the plaintiff’s nude body including his genitals.\n23.  The officer had no reason to suspect that Mr. Garvey had any weapons or contraband\nhidden on his person. The officer did not find anything as a result of the strip search. After the\nsearch, Mr. Garvey was required to put on a jail uniform.\n24.  The next morning, Mr. Garvey was strip searched again before he was allowed to put\non his clothing to go to court.\n25.  Once at the courthouse, all charges were dropped against Mr. Garvey and he was\ninformed that he was free to leave. \n-4-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 5 of 8(cid:10)\n26.  Mr. Garvey suffered emotional distress as a result of the strip search. He was\nsurprised and shocked. He felt humiliated, degraded, and violated.\n27.  General Order 506 of the Office of the Franklin County Sheriff was a policy established\nand/or maintained by Sheriff Macdonald and implemented by Special Sheriff Byron that required\nFranklin County Jail officers to view, without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion, the\nnaked body of every person at the time of admission to the Franklin County Jail and before leaving for\na first court appearance. This policy applied regardless of the person’s charges or anticipated duration\nof detention. The policy directed employees of the Sheriff’s Department to conduct unconstitutional\nstrip searches of the plaintiff and members of the plaintiff class.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n28.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b) (1) and (3) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure by the named plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all people strip searched after\nMarch 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, without individualized reasonable suspicion at the\nFranklin County Jail due to the a policy or practice of Sheriff Macdonald:\n(a)  while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested on\ncharges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony, or\n(b)  while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default or other\nwarrant for charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent\nfelony.\n29.  The named plaintiff, Gregory Garvey, is a member of the class. The class represented\nby the plaintiff is so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impractical. On information and\nbelief, the policy or practice described above has existed for more than three years before this\ncomplaint was filed, affecting hundreds of potential class members. \n-5-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 6 of 8(cid:10)\n30.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class of plaintiffs. Central to all\nthe claims is the nature and constitutionality of the policy or practice of Sheriff Macdonald regarding\nintake strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion of pre-arraignment detainees.\n31.  The named plaintiff’s claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass of plaintiffs.\n32.  The named plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of\nthe members of the class. Counsel for the plaintiff is experienced and capable in civil rights\nlitigation. Class counsel has successfully represented plaintiffs in other class actions alleging\nunlawful strip searches. Counsel has the resources and expertise to prosecute this action.\n33.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because the prosecutions of\nseparate actions by the individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying\nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class, which would establish incompatible\nstandards of conduct for the defendant.\n34.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because the prosecution of\nseparate actions would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\nthat would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the other members who are not\nparties or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.\n35.  As a direct result of the policy or practice as described above, class members have\nbeen subjected to unlawful strip searches, which has caused each member of the class to endure\nemotional distress, humiliation, and degradation. \n-6-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 7 of 8(cid:10)\nCLAIM: 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n36.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein.\n37.  Sheriff Macdonald was the chief executive officer of the Franklin County Sheriff’s\nDepartment. He promulgated the strip search policy at the Franklin County Jail.\n38.  Sheriff Macdonald knew, or should have known, that there was a policy of conducting\nstrip searches, without individualized reasonable suspicion, of pre-arraignment prisoners at intake\nand again before court in violation of the United States Constitution. He had an obligation to correct\nthis practice so that it would conform to the Constitution.\n39.  Special Sheriff Superintendent Byron was responsible for supervision and daily\noperations of the Franklin County Jail. He implemented the strip search policy at the Jail.\n40.  Special Sheriff Superintendent Byron knew, or should have known, that there was\na policy or practice of conducting strip searches, without individualized reasonable suspicion, of pre-\narraignment prisoners at intake and again before court in violation of the United States Constitution.\nHe had an obligation to correct this practice so that it would conform to the Constitution.\n41.  By allowing the policy or practice of routine strip searches to continue during the\nclass period, defendants Macdonald and Byron acted with reckless indifference to the constitutional\nrights of individuals who were detained at the Franklin County Jail as described above.\n42.  Ten years before January 30, 2007, the law was clearly established that routine intake\nstrip searches of pre-arraignment detainees like the plaintiff and members of the plaintiff class\nwithout evaluating for cause were unconstitutional. A decision granting summary judgment to\nplaintiffs for a similar policy implemented by the Sheriff of Suffolk County Massachusetts was\nissued on July 31, 2001. Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp.2d 131 (D.Mass. 2001) (holding the\n-7-\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 1     Filed 03/28/2007     Page 8 of 8(cid:10)\nlaw regarding strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees without individualized suspicion was\nclearly established in 1997).\n43.  By the actions described above, the defendants deprived the named plaintiff and\nmembers of the plaintiff class of their clearly established right, guaranteed by the Constitution of the\nUnited States, to be free from unreasonable searches.\n44.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, the plaintiff and the plaintiff class\nhave suffered injuries as described above.\nWHEREFORE the plaintiffs request that this Court:\n1. Award compensatory damages and punitive damages to the named plaintiff and to\nmembers of the plaintiff class;\n2. Award the plaintiffs the costs of this action including reasonable attorney’s fees; and\n3.  Award whatever additional relief this Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nJURY DEMAND\nA jury trial is hereby demanded.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\n/s/ Howard Friedman\n____________________________\nHoward Friedman\nBBO #180080\nJennifer L.

MACDONALD and FORBES )\nBYRON in their individual capacities, )\nDefendants )\n__________________________________________)\nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF CLASS CERTIFICATION\nPlaintiff, Gregory Garvey, seeks to represent a class of approximately 400 people who\nwere illegally strip searched at the Franklin County Jail and House of Correction (“Jail”). The\nproposed class consists of all people strip searched without individualized reasonable suspicion on\nor after March 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the Franklin County Jail\n(a)  while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested\non charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony, or\n(b)  while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default or other\nwarrant for charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent\nfelony.\nThe illegal searches were conducted pursuant to a policy or practice of Sheriff Frederick\nMacdonald’s that was implemented by Special Sheriff Forbes Byron, the jail superintendent.\nPlaintiff moves the Court to certify this case as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff seeks to represent a class of approximately 400 class members who were injured\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 2 of 14\nby the unconstitutional strip searches at the Jail pursuant to a formal written policy established by\nSheriff Macdonald, which was implemented by Special Sheriff Byron. On February 25, 2007, the\nDefendants ended the challenged policy.\nCourts in numerous jurisdictions around the country have certified similar class actions\nbecause they serve the interests of justice and easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 23.1 In the\nDistrict of Massachusetts, three very similar class actions have been certified for pre-arraignment\ndetainees who were strip searched at a jail based on a blanket strip search policy like the one at\nissue in this case: Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000); Connor v. Plymouth\nCounty, Civil Action No. 00-10835-RBC (D. Mass.); and Ryan v. Garvey, Civil Action No. 05-\n30017-MAP (D. Mass.). The First Circuit approved class certification in two similar cases in\nMaine. Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004). If this Court certifies this action, it\nwill preside over a manageable case that – like many such cases before it – will provide a uniform\nand efficient resolution of the claims arising from Defendants’ strip search practices.\nII.  FACTS\nA.  The Named Plaintiff Was Strip Searched Pursuant to the Jail’s Policy\nThe named Plaintiff was subjected to Defendants’ uniform strip search policy.2 On\nTuesday, January 30, 2007, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Sunderland police officers arrived at\nMr. Garvey’s home and placed him under arrest for failure to appear in court earlier that day for a\nmotor vehicle case. Mr. Garvey had not received notice of the court date. After the arrest, the\n     1 See, e.g., Johnson v. District of Columbia, -- F. Supp. 2d --, 2008 WL 344739, at *2 (D.D.C. 2008)\n(“Courts routinely certify strip search class actions.”) (collecting cases)\n     2 Except as noted, the facts in this section are taken from the Complaint.\n2\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 3 of 14\npolice officers took Mr. Garvey to the Sunderland Police Station, where he was fingerprinted and\nprocessed. Then Sunderland police officers took him to the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield,\nMassachusetts, to be held until he could appear in court the next morning. It was the practice of\npolice officers in Sunderland and other police departments in Franklin County to bring pre-\narraignment detainees to the Franklin County Jail to be held before their first court appearance.\nThis practice was mandated by General Order 506, which Sheriff Macdonald issued and Special\nSheriff Byron implemented, and which was in effect throughout the proposed class period. Until\nFebruary 25, 2007, when it was modified, the order mandated that all detainees except those in\nprotective custody were to be strip searched on admission to the Jail and again before leaving the\nJail to go to court.3\nDuring the admission procedure at the Franklin County Jail, a correctional officer ordered\nMr. Garvey to remove all of his clothing, and he had to submit to a strip search. The next\nmorning, Mr. Garvey was strip searched again before he was allowed to put on his clothing to go\nto court. There was no reason at any time to suspect that Mr. Garvey had contraband on his body.\nNo contraband was found during either strip search. When Mr. Garvey appeared in court, all of\nthe charges were dropped against Mr. Garvey, and he was informed that he was free to leave.\nB.  Defendants Had a Policy of Strip Searching Arrestees without Individualized\nReasonable Suspicion\nGeneral Order 506 of the Office of the Franklin County Sheriff required Franklin County\nJail officers to conduct a strip search, without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion,\nof every person both at the time of admission to the Franklin County Jail and before leaving for a\n     3 See Affidavit of Howard Friedman (“Friedman Aff.”) ¶ 10 & Exhibit A, § .05.\n3\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 4 of 14\nfirst court appearance, with the sole exception of those people who were held pursuant to the\nprotective custody statute. The policy applied regardless of the person’s charges or anticipated\nduration of detention. The policy directed employees of the Sheriff’s Department to conduct\nillegal strip searches of the Plaintiff and of every member of the Plaintiff class. From March 28,\n2004, until February 25, 2007, approximately 400 individuals were strip-searched pursuant to this\npolicy.4\nDefendants Macdonald and Byron knew, or should have known, that the policy or practice\nof conducting strip searches at intake of pre-arraignment prisoners, without individualized\nreasonable suspicion, violated the United States Constitution. On July 31, 2001, a Massachusetts\ndistrict court issued a decision granting summary judgment to plaintiffs for a similar policy\nimplemented by the Sheriff of Suffolk County, holding that the law was clearly established in 1997\nthat routine intake strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees without evaluating for cause were\nunconstitutional.5 Although Defendants Macdonald and Bryon had an obligation to correct their\npolicy so that it would conform to the Constitution, they allowed it to continue until February 25,\n2007.\n     4 Affidavit of David Milton (“Milton Aff.”) ¶¶ 6-8.\n     5 Ford v.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe named Plaintiff moves this Court to certify this action as a class action pursuant to\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3). Rule 23 provides that any action may be\nmaintained as a class action when it meets the four prerequisite of subsection (a) and fits within\nany of the classifications set out in subsection (b).\nClass certification, like most issues arising under Rule 23, is committed in the first instance\nto the discretion of the district court.6  The requirements of the rule are to be given “a liberal\nrather than a restrictive construction, and courts are to adopt a standard of flexibility.”7 In close\ncases, courts should err in favor of certification.8 “In determining the propriety of a class action,\nthe question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause of action or will prevail on\nthe merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.”9\nB.  THIS CLASS SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(a)\nThe proposed class easily satisfies the four criteria of Rule 23(a). Each of these\nrequirements – numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation – is discussed\n     6 Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 703 (1979); see also Lamphere v.

Litig., 432 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n2005)(district court may not inquire whether plaintiffs will prevail on the merits but may “look beyond the\npleadings” to determine whether requirements for class certification are met).\n5\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 6 of 14\nin turn below.\n1.  The Class Is So Numerous That Joinder of All Members Is Impracticable\nThe proposed class includes approximately 400 class members who have had their rights\nviolated by Defendants’ strip search policy. Joinder of all these people as individual plaintiffs\nwould be impractical. As a leading treatise on class actions notes, “the difficulty inherent in joining\nas few as 40 class members should raise a presumption that joinder is impracticable.”10 This is\nespecially true in this case, which alleges a violation of privacy and which arises out of class\nmembers’ arrests, since many class members whose constitutional rights were violated might be\nreluctant to be publicly identified as a plaintiff. The numerosity prerequisite has been satisfied.\n2. There Are Questions of Law or Fact Common to the Class\nPlaintiffs easily clear the “low hurdle” for showing commonality under Rule 23(a), “which\nrequires only a basic demonstration that there are common questions of law or fact in the case.”11\nThis requirement is met by even a single issue of law or fact common to the putative class.12\nWhere, as here, the “claims of the proposed class stem from the same alleged unconstitutional\nconduct of the defendants,”13 commonality is satisfied notwithstanding whatever individualized\n     10 1 Herbert Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions (“Newberg”) §3:5 (4th ed. 1992); see also,\ne.g., In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 218 F.R.D. 337, 342 (D.

In\ncertifying strip search class actions, courts have routinely found commonality satisfied where, as\nin this case, the searches were conducted (or alleged to be conducted) pursuant to a uniform strip\nsearch policy or custom.15\n3.  The Claims of the Representative Party Are Typical of Those of the Class\nA class representative’s claims are “typical” when “named plaintiffs’ claims arise from the\nsame course of conduct that gave rise to the claims of the absent [class] members.”16 The named\nPlaintiff’s claims here arise from the same policy as the claims of the unnamed Plaintiffs. Pursuant\nto Defendants’ uniform policy, Plaintiff and all class members were subjected to strip searches\n     14 See Mack,191 F.R.D. at 23; Risinger ex rel. Risinger v. Concannon, 201 F.R.D. 16, 19 (D. Me. 2001)\n(“[V]arying fact patterns may underlie individual claims as long as a common pattern of unlawful conduct by the\ndefendant is directed at class members.”) (citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Newberg § 3.10 \n(“When the party opposing the class has engaged in some course of conduct that affects a group of persons and\ngives rise to a cause of action, one or more of the elements of that cause of action will be common to all of the\npersons affected.”).\n     15 See, e.g., Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 23 (“[Class representatives and class members] share a common legal\ntheory, that these searches were unconstitutional because, conducted pursuant to a blanket strip-search\npolicy, they were not based on a reasonable suspicion that the individuals searched were concealing\nweapons or contraband.”); Engeseth v.

There was nothing atypical about the circumstances\nof Mr. Garvey’s search, and there is nothing atypical about Mr. Garvey’s legal claims. In any\nevent, it is well established that any factual differences that exist among the claims “will not\npreclude class certification when the claims arise from the same course of conduct and give rise to\nthe same legal or remedial theories.”17\n4.  The Representative Party Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the Interests of\nthe Class\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiffs will “fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.” Specifically, the named plaintiff must show that “there exists no conflict\nbetween the interests of the Named Plaintiffs and the class members.”18 Only a “fundamental”\nconflict will defeat adequacy under the rule.19\nHere, there is little if any potential for conflict, given that the claims of the named Plaintiff\nand those of absent class members “state common injuries and legal theories.”20 Because all class\nmembers were strip searched pursuant to the same policy as the named Plaintiff, all will benefit\nfrom a showing that such policy was unconstitutional.21\n     17 Engeseth, 2007 WL 3102074, at *7; see also, e.g, Baby Neal for and by Kantor v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48,\n58 (3d Cir. 1994) (“[C]ases challenging the same unlawful conduct which affects both the named plaintiffs and\nthe putative class usually satisfy the typicality requirement irrespective of the varying fact patterns underlying\nthe individual claims.”) (citing Newberg § 3:13); Payne, 216 F.R.D. at 26 (quoting 5 Moore's Federal Practice\n§ 23.24[4]).\n     18 Southern States, 241 F.R.D. at 88.\n     19 In re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 145 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Newberg\n§3.26).\n     20 Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 23.\n     21 See Hirschfeld v.

If the named plaintiffs prevail, all class members will benefit.”).\n8\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 9 of 14\n5.  Attorneys for the Named Plaintiff Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the\nInterests of the Class\nWhen certifying a class, the court must appoint class counsel who will fairly and\nadequately represent the class’s interests.22 In making such an appointment, the court must\nconsider counsel’s work in identifying or investigating potential claims; counsel’s experience in\nhandling class actions, complex litigation, and claims similar to those asserted in the action;\ncounsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; the resources counsel will commit to representing the\nclass; and any other matter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the\ninterests of the class.23 \nPlaintiffs’ counsel, the Law Offices of Howard Friedman, P.C., easily meet this standard.\nAs the attached affidavits show, the firm’s attorneys bring a wealth of relevant experience to this\nlitigation and are well-acquainted with complex federal litigation. Attorney Friedman has\nextensive experience in §1983 litigation in state and federal courts and has successfully\nrepresented plaintiffs in other class action suits, including four that, like this case, alleged an\nunconstitutional policy or custom of strip searching pre-arraignment detainees.24 Attorney David\nMilton, an associate at the firm, also has significant experience bringing civil rights cases under\n§1983 on both an individual and class-wide basis.25 The firm has identified and investigated the\n     22 Fed.

THIS CLASS ACTION IS PROPERLY MAINTAINABLE UNDER RULE 23(b)(3)\nOF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE\n“Certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) is ‘intended to be a less stringent requirement’\nthan certification pursuant to either Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2).”28 A Rule 23(b)(3) class is\nappropriate where the court finds that common questions of law or fact predominate over\nindividual ones and that a class action is superior to other methods of adjudicating the\ncontroversy.29 Both of these prongs are met in this case.\n1.  Common Legal and Factual Questions Predominate\nA finding of predominance is warranted where “common questions present a significant\naspect of the case and they can be resolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication.”30\nPredominance does not require uniformity among the claims of class members, but merely “a\nsufficient constellation of common issues [that] binds class members together.”31 In light of this\nstandard, courts have routinely certified (b)(3) classes in civil rights cases on behalf of detainees\n     26 Friedman Aff. ¶ 12.\n     27 Friedman Aff. ¶ 13.\n     28 Southern States, 241 F.R.D. at 88-89 (citing Smilow v.

In affirming class certification decisions in two cases alleging\nunlawful strip searches of detainees in Maine, the Court held that where common questions\nregarding liability predominate, the existence of individualized damages issues does not defeat\nclass certification.33 Further, as the First Circuit has explained, district courts have a number of\nprocedural devices for dealing with individualized damages issues that may arise.34\nIn Mack, the plaintiffs were, as here, all arrestees subjected to strip searches without\nindividualized reasonable suspicion. The court held that “given the uniform and indiscriminate\nnature of the strip search policy . . . liability can be determined on a class-wide, rather than\nindividual basis.”35 After the case was certified, summary judgment established the defendants’\n     32 See, e.g., Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6 (affirming certification of two class actions where class members\nwere all subject to the same strip search policy); In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219,\n230-31 (2d Cir. 2006) (reversing denial of certification of class action arising out of blanket strip search\npolicy); Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 24 (certifying class of women detainees subjected to same strip search\npolicy); Johnson, 2008 WL 344739, at *2 (certifying class of arrestees subject to blanket strip search\npolicy); see also Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177, 182 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“In similar\ncircumstances involving facility-wide strip search policies, courts have not hesitated to certify\nclasses.”)(collecting cases).\n     33 Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6; see also Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40 (collecting cases and other authorities); Mack, 191\nF.R.D. at 25 (despite the possibility of individualized damages, class certification was appropriate because the\nplaintiffs, who were subjected to the same strip search policy, shared sufficient common legal claims)\n     34 See Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6; Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40; see also In re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust\nLitig., 280 F.3d at 141 (district court may, inter alia, bifurcate liability and damages trials, appoint magistrate\njudge or special master to oversee damages determinations, create subclasses or alter class definition, or enter\njudgment on liability only), cited in Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40.\n     35 Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 25.\n11\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 12 of 14\nliability to all class members; the issue of damages was resolved by settlement.36\nAs in Mack, all proposed class members here have been subjected to an unconstitutional\nstrip search. The injuries to all class members arise out of a single course of conduct. All class\nmembers share a single legal theory arising under similar factual circumstances. Because common\nfactual and legal issues far outweigh the individual issues in this case, this court should grant\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).\n2.  Class Action Is Superior to Other Methods of Adjudication\nRule 23(b)(3) also requires that the court determine that a class action is “superior to\nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.” The rule lists\nfour nonexclusive factors for courts to consider, each of which, as discussed below, supports\ncertification. \nThe first factor – the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the\nprosecution of separate actions – weighs in favor of class certification. This case presents a classic\nexample of one where few class members are likely to bring individual lawsuits in light of the\nrelatively small amount of damages that one would likely recover.37 If class certification is denied,\nthen the constitutional harm suffered by hundreds of individuals will go unredressed.\nThe second and third factors also support certification. Plaintiffs’ counsel is unaware of\n     36 The undersigned represented the plaintiff and plaintiff class in Mack.\n     37 See Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 (finding superiority because “[t] vast majority of claims would never be\nbrought because provable actual damages are too small”); Smilow, 323 F.3d at 41 (noting that “policy\ngoals underlying Rule 23(b)(3)” support certification as a means of vindicating rights of “groups of people\nwhose individual claims would be too small to warrant litigation”); see also In Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d 230 (“[W]ithout class notification, most putative class members will not even\nknow that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights.”).\n12\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 21   Filed 03/14/08   Page 13 of 14\nany litigation already commenced (or even contemplated) by members of the class, and this forum,\nwhere class members were all housed and where the majority of the class members presumably\nreside, is the most appropriate.\nFinally, no great difficulties will arise in managing this case as a class action. The identity\nof every class member is known to the Defendants, who also possess a last-known address for all\nclass members. Class membership can be determined from Defendants’ computerized booking\nrecords.38\nV.  CONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs have met all of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for\ncertification of the class. Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that this Court certify the Plaintiff\nclass as described in their motion for Class Certification.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\n       /s/ Howard Friedman                             \nHoward Friedman, BBO #180080\nDavid Milton, BBO #668908\nLaw Offices of Howard Friedman P.C.\n90 Canal Street, 5th Floor\nBoston, MA 02114-2022\nT (617) 742-4100\nF (617) 742-5858\nhfriedman@civil-rights-law.com\ndmilton@civil-rights-law.com\nDate: March 14, 2008\n     38 In any event, “failure to certify an action under Rule 23(b)(3) on the sole ground that it would be\nunmanageable is disfavored and should be the exception rather than the rule.” Newberg §4.25.

This is a civil rights class action for Fourth Amendment\nviolations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Franklin County Sheriff Frederick Macdonald and\nSpecial Sheriff Forbes Bryon. Plaintiffs seek money damages. Plaintiffs challenge defendants’\npolicy of requiring employees under their supervision to strip search all prearraignment detainees\nat the Franklin County Jail without individualized reasonable suspicion. This policy, which was\nin place throughout the class period (March 28, 2004 to February 24, 2007, inclusive), affected\nhundreds of individuals and violated clearly established law. Defendants admit that they\nmaintained the blanket strip-search policy and that employees followed the policy. Because\nneither these nor any other material facts are in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nAt approximately 11:00 pm on January 30, 2007, Sunderland police officers came to\nPlaintiff Gregory Garvey’s home and arrested him on a default warrant for failure to appear in\ncourt on the charge of operating on a suspended driver’s license. Plaintiffs’ Local Rule 56.1\nStatement (“Pl. 56.1 Statement”) ¶ 25. Mr. Garvey had not received notice of the court date. Id.\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 2 of 10\n¶ 24. Sunderland police officers took him to the Franklin County Jail and House of Correction\n(“Franklin County Jail”) in Greenfield, Massachusetts, to be held until he could appear in court\nthe next morning. Id. ¶ 26. Police officers in Sunderland and other police departments in\nFranklin County regularly brought arrestees and individuals arrested on default or other warrants\n(collectively, “prearraignment detainees”) to the Franklin County Jail to be held before their first\ncourt appearance. Id. ¶ 5. The facility housed prearraignment detainees, detainees being held\npending trial (“pretrial detainees”), and prisoners serving committed sentences. Id. ¶ 6.\nWhen Mr. Garvey arrived at the Franklin County Jail, a correctional officer placed him in\na cell by himself in the booking area. Id. ¶ 26. Next, a uniformed correctional officer entered the\ncell and ordered Mr. Garvey to take off all of his clothes. Id. ¶ 27. When Mr. Garvey was\ncompletely naked, the corrections officer said, “We have to watch you do it. Bend over. Spread\nyour cheeks.” Id. Garvey did as he was told. Id. The officer looked at his naked body, including\nhis genitals. Id. There was no reason for the officer to believe Mr. Garvey had hidden contraband,\nand none was found during the strip search. Id. ¶ 33.\nAfter the strip search, the officer ordered Mr. Garvey to dress in a jail jump suit. Id. ¶ 28.\nAfter Mr. Garvey did so, he was ordered to leave the cell for booking. Id. ¶ 29. The booking\nofficer asked him questions and took his photograph. Id. After the booking process, an officer put\nhim back in the same cell in the booking area. Id. Mr. Garvey remained in that cell by himself\nuntil morning. Id. Jail records show that Garvey was booked into the jail at 1:19 a.m. on January\n31, 2007. Id. ¶ 30. At approximately seven o’clock in the morning, a uniformed corrections\nofficer came into Mr. Garvey’s cell. Id. ¶ 31. He ordered Mr. Garvey to remove the jail uniform\nand his underwear. Id. Once again when Mr. Garvey was completely naked, the officer ordered\n2\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 3 of 10\nhim to bend over and spread his buttocks. Id. The officer looked at his naked body, including his\ngenitals. Id. There was no reason for the officer to believe Mr. Garvey had hidden contraband,\nand none was found during the strip search. Id. ¶ 33. After the strip search, Mr. Garvey was\nallowed to put on his clothing. Id. ¶ 31. Afterwards Mr. Garvey was chained to other prisoners\nand taken to Greenfield District Court. Id. ¶ 32. This was the first time he had come in contact\nwith any other prisoners. Id. When Garvey appeared in court, the judge dismissed the charges\nagainst him. Id. ¶ 34. He was released from custody and allowed to go home. Id.\nMr. Garvey’s experience was typical of other prearraignment detainees at the Franklin\nCounty Jail during the class period. Id. ¶ 35. Defendants’ policy and practice required that\ncorrectional officers strip-search all prearraignment detainees1 both at the time of admission to\nthe jail and before leaving for a first court appearance, with the sole exception of those people\nwho were held in protective custody. Id. ¶ 4. The strip-search upon admission was conducted\nbefore the detainee went through the booking process. Id. ¶ 10. All prearraignment detainees\nwere strip-searched without regard to the crimes for which they were being held, and without\nregard to whether the searching officer suspected that the particular individual being searched\nwas carrying weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Id. ¶ 13. All detainees were strip-searched\nwithout regard to where in the facility they would be housed, and without regard to whether they\nwould come into contact with other inmates. Id. ¶ 14. The manner in which Mr. Garvey was\nstrip-searched was also consistent with jail policy and procedure, and typical of the manner in\n     1 The memo uses the term “prearraignment detainees” to refer to individuals detained while waiting\nfor bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested, or while waiting for a first court\nappearance after being arrested on a default or other warrant.\n3\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 4 of 10\nwhich other detainees were strip searched. Id. ¶ 11.2\nApproximately 927 people were held as prearraignment detainees during the class period.\nId. ¶ 15. In only one instance during the class period were drugs found as a result of a strip\nsearch; that individual had been brought in for possession of drugs with intent to distribute and is\nnot part of the class in this case. Id. ¶ 17. In another instance a strip-search revealed that an\nindividual had pierced nipples with rings fused together (such that they could not be removed by\nhand). Id. In no other instance during the class period was a strip-search necessary to reveal drugs\nor contraband. Id. ¶ 18. In only three instances (besides the two described above) was contraband\nfound on a prearraignment detainee during the booking process at the Franklin County Jail. Id. In\neach of these three cases, however, drugs were found in the individual’s clothing or backpack,\nand thus could have been found without subjecting the individuals to a strip-search. Id.\nDefendant Sheriff Frederick Macdonald has been the Franklin County sheriff since 1993.\nId. ¶ 1. As the top official in the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, he has statutory control and\nresponsibility, and is the final policymaker, for the Franklin County Jail. Id. He is responsible for\nensuring that the policies of the Jail comply with the Constitution. Id. Since 1997, Defendant\nSpecial Sheriff Forbes Byron has been Superintendent of the Jail. Id. ¶ 2. He is the chief\nadministrative officer of the Sheriff’s Office, and is in charge of operations at the Jail. Id. Sheriff\nMacdonald issued and Superintendent Byron implemented General Order 506, which contained\nthe written strip-search policy that was in place throughout the class period. Id. ¶ 3.\n     2 One officer described his standard instructions to the naked prisoner as follows: “Put your hands up,\nopen your fingers, open your mouth, lift up your tongue, show me behind your ears, lift up your genitals,\nturn around, show me the bottoms of each foot, and spread your buttocks with your hands.” Id. (citing\nDeposition of Peter Dionne at 8). Other officers’ descriptions are similar. Milton Decl. ¶ 11.\n4\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 5 of 10\nSuperintendent Byron reviewed and supported the policy before it took effect. Id.\nOn April 15, 2008, this Court certified the following class under Rule 23(b)(3) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure: All people strip searched without individualized reasonable\nsuspicion on or after March 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the Franklin County Jail\n(a) while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested on charges\nthat did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony, or (b) while waiting for a\nfirst court appearance after being arrested on a default or other warrant for charges that did not\ninvolve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony. The class consists of approximately 500\npeople. Milton Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.\nARGUMENT\nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nA district court should enter summary judgment if, viewing the record in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Mariasch v. Gillette Co., 521 F.3d 68,\n71 (1st Cir.  2008) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). “Once the moving party avers the absence of\ngenuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist, but\nsummary judgment cannot be defeated by relying on improbable inferences, conclusory\nallegations, or rank speculation.” Id. (quoting Ingram v. Brink’s, Inc., 414 F.3d 222, 228-29 (1st\nCir. 2005)).\nII. DEFENDANTS’ UNIFORM POLICY VIOLATED CLEAR FIRST CIRCUIT \nPRECEDENT REQUIRING REASONABLE SUSPICION BEFORE STRIP-\nSEARCHING PREARRAIGNMENT DETAINEES\nWell before the beginning of the class period, the law in the First Circuit clearly\n5\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 6 of 10\nestablished that a prearraignment detainee may not be subjected to a strip search absent\nreasonable suspicion that he or she is concealing contraband or weapons. Roberts v. Rhode\nIsland, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001). A blanket strip-search policy of all pre-arraignment\ndetainees cannot be justified by mere invocation of security considerations or simply because\npre-arraignment detainees are housed in the general population. Id. at 113. Since it is undisputed\nthat defendants maintained and enforced a blanket strip-search policy throughout the class\nperiod, summary judgment is appropriate.3\n“[P]retrial detainees retain constitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic\nFourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Roberts, 239 F.3d at 109.\nThe Fourth Amendment applies to strip searches and visual body cavity searches4 of pretrial\ndetainees. Id.; Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997). Determining whether a particular\nsearch is constitutional “requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.” Swain, 117 F.3d at 6 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979)).\n     3 As sheriff throughout the class period, Defendant Macdonald had final policy making authority for\nestablishing the strip search policies in question, and thus “clearly bears responsibility” for them. Ford v.\nCity of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131, 146 (D. Mass. 2001). Defendant Byron likewise is liable for the\npolicies, which he knew about, supported, and implemented, and for which he admits responsibility, as\nchief administrative officer of the Jail. Pl. 56.1 Statement ¶ 2-3. See Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d\n41, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1999) (supervisory liability appropriate where defendant was “primary actor involved\nin, or a prime mover behind, the underlying violation” such that there is “an affirmative link, whether\nthrough direct participation or through conduct that amounts to condonation or tacit authorization”).\n     4 The First Circuit defines a “strip search” as a visual inspection of an inmate’s naked body, and a\n“visual body cavity search” as a strip search that includes the visual inspection of an inmate’s anal and\ngenital areas. Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1985). As described below, the\nsearches at Franklin County were visual body cavity searches. Because both strip searches and visual\nbody cavity searches require reasonable suspicion, Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997), for\nease of reference this memo uses the “strip-search” generically to refer to both.\n6\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 7 of 10\nApplying this balancing test, the First Circuit has recognized that \nstrip and visual body cavity searches impinge seriously upon the values that the\nFourth Amendment was meant to protect. These searches require an arrestee not only\nto strip naked in front of a stranger, but also to expose the most private areas of her\nbody to others. This is often, as here, done while the person arrested is required to\nassume degrading and humiliating positions. Our circuit has recognize[d], as have all\ncourts that have considered the issue, the severe if not gross interference with a\nperson's privacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body\ncavities.\nSwain, 117 F.3d at 6 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n110 (“[W]e consider [visual body cavity] searches an extreme intrusion on personal privacy and\nan offense to the dignity of the individual.”)(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAgainst this “extreme intrusion on personal privacy” the court must weigh the\njustification for the search. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110-11. In this case, Franklin County Jail\nofficials, following the directives of the defendants, did not conduct an evaluation to determine\nwhether individualized reasonable suspicion existed before the officials strip-searched every\nprearraignment detainee as a matter of routine policy before the detainee was booked into the jail.\nSheriff’s department employees strip searched class members without regard to whether there\nwas any cause to believe the person was carrying weapons, drugs, or other contraband.5 Thus, the\nonly possible justification for subjecting all class members to a strip and visual body cavity\nsearch would be a finding that institutional security concerns outweighed every individual’s\nrights to dignity and privacy. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110-11; Tardiff v. Knox County, 573 F. Supp.\n     5 Individuals who were arrested for crimes involving a weapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony\nare not part of the class. Although these individuals were not in fact strip-searched because of the nature\nof their charges, they could have been lawfully strip-searched for this reason, and thus have been\nexcluded from the class. See Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 (“The reasonable suspicion standard may be met\nsimply by the fact that the inmate was charged with a violent felony.”).\n7\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 8 of 10\n2d 301, 305 (D. Me. 2008); Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142. Nothing in the record supports such a\nfinding. On the contrary, courts, including the First Circuit in Roberts, have rejected the very\nsecurity rationales that Defendants here are likely to advance. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111-13;\nTardiff, 573 F.Supp. 2d at 307; Ford, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 142-44.\nIn Roberts, the Court held that the Rhode Island Department of Correction’s policy of\nstrip-searching all pretrial detainees at the Adult Correctional Institute (“ACI”) was\nunconstitutional. The Court did so even though Rhode Island did not have separate facilities to\nhouse pretrial detainees, who were held in the ACI along with prisoners serving committed state\nsentences. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 109, 113. That the ACI intake area was “considered a maximum\nsecurity prison,” id. at 109, did not justify the blanket search policy, nor did the fact that\ndetainees intermingled with the general prison population, id. at 112-13. Nor did the “lengthy\nhistory of contraband problems” at the ACI save the blanket policy from being held\nunconstitutional. Id. at 112. The record in Roberts revealed that in virtually all instances where\ncontraband was found on an incoming inmate, a strip-search was unnecessary to discover the\ncontraband, which was retrieved from the detainees’ clothes or effects. Id. The same is true here,\nas is discussed below.\nRoberts dictates the outcome in this case. The fact that prearraignment detainees were\nhoused in the same building as inmates being held pending trial and serving sentences does not\njustify defendants’ blanket strip-search policy, nor does the fact that on occasion some\nprearraignment detainees may have been housed in general population. In Roberts, even routine\nintermingling did not justify strip-searching everyone. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112-13; see also\nFord, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 140.\n8\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 9 of 10\nMoreover, while defendants may invoke a “history of contraband problems” in support of\nthe policy, scrutiny of the record belies any claim that strip-searching all detainees was necessary\nto combat these supposed problems. In response to discovery requests seeking information on all\ncontraband or weapons found “as a result of strip searches” of detainees during the class period,\ndefendants produced only seven reports from this nearly three-year period during which there\nwere approximately 927 prearraignment intakes. Of the seven incidents, a strip-search was\nnecessary to reveal the contraband in only one – a strip-search during which drugs fell from the\ndetainee’s buttocks. However, that detainee was being held on a drug distribution charge and\ncould have been lawfully strip searched because the offense supplied the needed individualized\nsuspicion. He is therefore not a class member.\nAll but one of the remaining six reports of contraband either did not involve\nprearraignment detainees or strip-searches, or involved drugs found in the individual’s clothing\nor personal property.6 “The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was necessary\nto discover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an\nunreasonable one.” Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112; see also Tardiff, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 307 n.7\n(incidents where contraband found during cell shakedowns or in inmates’ clothing “are irrelevant\nto the question of whether a strip and visual body cavity search was necessary”). The lack of\ncontraband found concealed on or in the naked bodies of prearraignment detainees is not\nsurprising, “given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent incarceration.”\nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 111; see also Ford, 154 F.Supp.2d at 142 (“It defies belief to suppose that\n     6 The only other report of “contraband” involved an individual who had permanently attached nipple rings,\nwhich presumably could have been detected by a far less invasive pat-search.\n9\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 32   Filed 11/17/08   Page 10 of 10\nany of the plaintiffs deliberately sought arrest in order to smuggle contraband or weapons into the\nJail.”).\nIn short, and as a matter of law, Defendants’ institutional concerns do not justify the\n“severe if not gross interference with a person’s privacy” that their policy of strip-searching all\nprearraignment detainees entailed. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110. “[A]n indiscriminate strip search\npolicy routinely applied ... can not be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in\nattending to security considerations.” Id. at 113. Accordingly, summary judgment on liability is\nappropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\n      /s/ Howard Friedman                             \nHoward Friedman, BBO #180080\nDavid Milton, BBO #668908\nLaw Offices of Howard Friedman P.C.\n90 Canal Street, 5th Floor\nBoston, MA 02114-2022\nT (617) 742-4100\nF (617) 742-5858\nhfriedman@civil-rights-law.com\ndmilton@civil-rights-law.com\nDate: November 17, 2008\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI certify that on this day I caused a true copy of the above\ndocument to be served upon the attorney of record for all parties via ECF.\nDate: 11/17/08 /s/ Howard Friedman\nHoward Friedman\n10",

The class this court certified on April 15, 2008,\nconsists of the following:\nAll people strip searched without individualized suspicion on or after\nMarch 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the [FCJ] (a) while\nwaiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being\narrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a\nviolent felony, or (b) while waiting for a first court appearance after being\narrested on a default or other warrant for charges that did not involve a\nweapon, drugs, contraband or a violent felony.\n(Docket No. 18 and Electronic Order dated Apr. 15, 2008.)  Plaintiffs and Defendants --\nSheriff Frederick Macdonald and Special Sheriff Forbes Byron, both of whom have\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 2 of 19\nbeen sued in their individual capacities -- have consented to the jurisdiction of this\ncourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\nFor the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment will be\nallowed and Defendants’ cross-motion will be denied.  There are two questions at issue\nin the cross-motions:  (1) whether the strip-search policy in place at the FCJ during the\nclass period was unconstitutional; and (2) even if the policy was unconstitutional,\nwhether qualified immunity bars this action against Defendants.  In the court’s opinion,\nthe answer to the first question is “yes” while the answer to the second is “no.”\nI.  BACKGROUND\nIn presenting this background, the court has focused solely on the undisputed\nfacts submitted by the parties.  See Littlefield v. Acadia Ins. Co., 392 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n2004) (“Cross motions simply require us to determine whether either of the parties\ndeserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.”) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  The court begins with Plaintiffs’ facts, turns to\nDefendants’ facts and then describes the procedural history.\nA.  Plaintiffs’ Facts\nAt around 11:00 p.m. on January 30, 2007, police officers from Sunderland,\nMassachusetts, came to Garvey’s home and arrested him on a default warrant for\nfailure to appear in court on the charge of operating on a suspended driver’s license. \n(Pls.’ Local Rule 56.1 Statement (hereinafter “Pls.’ Facts”) ¶ 25.)  The officers took\nGarvey to the FCJ to be held until he could appear in court the next morning.  (Id. ¶\n26.)\n2\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 3 of 19\nAt the time of Garvey’s arrest, police departments throughout Franklin County\nregularly brought arrestees and individuals arrested on default or other warrants\n(collectively, “pre-arraignment detainees”) to the FCJ to be held before their first court\nappearance.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  The facility, however, also housed detainees being held\npending trial (“pretrial detainees”) as well as prisoners serving committed sentences. \n(Id. ¶ 6.)\nWhen Garvey arrived at the FCJ, a correctional officer placed him in a cell by\nhimself in the booking area.  (Id. ¶ 26.)  Next, another officer entered the cell and\nordered him to take off all his clothes.  (Id. ¶ 27.)  When Garvey was completely naked,\nthe officer said:  “We have to watch you do it.  Bend over.  Spread your cheeks.”  (Id.) \nGarvey did as he was told and the officer looked at his naked body, including his\ngenitals.  (Id.)  There was no reason for the officer to believe Garvey had hidden\ncontraband, and none was found during the strip-search.  (Id. ¶ 33.)1\nAfter the search, the officer ordered Garvey to dress in a jail jump suit and leave\nthe cell for booking.  (Id. ¶¶ 28, 29.)  The booking officer then asked Garvey questions\nand took his photograph, after which another officer put him back in the same cell in the\nbooking area.  (Id. ¶ 29.)  Garvey remained in that cell by himself until morning.  (Id.)\nAt around 7:00 a.m., an officer came into Garvey’s cell and ordered him to\n1  The First Circuit defines a “strip-search” as a visual inspection of an inmate’s\nnaked body, and a “visual body cavity search” as a strip-search that includes the visual\ninspection of an inmate’s anal and genital areas.  See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d\n556, 561 n.3 (1st Cir. 1985).  Here, the parties use only the term “strip-search” to\ndescribe the searches at issue and, accordingly, the court does likewise, even though\nthe searches were more akin to the more intrusive visual body cavity searches.\n3\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 4 of 19\nremove the jump suit and his underwear.  (Id. ¶ 31.)  Once again, when Garvey was\ncompletely naked, the officer ordered him to bend over and spread his buttocks and\nthen the officer looked at his naked body, including his genitals.  (Id.)  As before, there\nwas no reason to believe Garvey had hidden contraband and none was found.  (Id. ¶\n33.)  After the strip-search, Garvey was allowed to put on his clothing.  (Id. ¶ 31.)\nSoon thereafter, Garvey was chained to other prisoners and taken to the\nGreenfield District Court.  (Id. ¶ 32.)  This was the first time he came in contact with any\nother prisoner.  (Id.)  When Garvey appeared in court, the judge dismissed the charges\nand released him from custody.  (Id. ¶ 34.)\nGarvey’s experience was typical of other pre-arraignment detainees at the FCJ\nduring the class period, as well as in conformance with the FCJ’s policy and practice. \n(Id. ¶¶ 11, 35.)  Defendants’ policy and practice at the time -- specifically section .05 of\n“General Order 506,” which was adopted on October 5, 2001, and reissued on October\n18, 2005 -- required that correctional officers strip-search all pre-arraignment detainees\nboth at the time of admission to the jail (prior to booking) and then again before leaving\nfor a first court appearance, with the sole exception of those people who were held in\nprotective custody.  (Id. ¶¶ 4, 10.)2\n2  In full, section .05 of General Order 506 provided as follows:\n1.  Inmates shall be strip searched in the following instances:\na.  prior to and at the conclusion of a transportation trip;\nb.  return from escape or attempted escape;\nc.  after visitation;\n4\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 5 of 19\nPursuant to Defendants’ policy and practice, all pre-arraignment detainees were\nstrip-searched without regard to where in the facility they would be housed or whether\nthey would come into contact with other inmates.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  In addition, all pre-\nd.  after return to the facility from temporary release; and\ne.  prior to placement in a segregation or other maximum-\nsecurity unit.\n2.  All admissions to the facility (with the exception of Protective Custody\ndetainees) shall be strip searched at the time of admission.\n3.  Protective Custody detainees, under an Officer’s supervision, shall be\nrequired to remove all outer garments and change into the standard\nissued uniform.  The Officer supervising this procedure shall be of the\nsame gender as the detainee.\n4.  Officers may, at any time, order the strip search of an inmate.  The\nOffice of Sheriff may, through General Orders, Directives and Post\nOrders, require strip searches in other situations.\n5.  Strip searches shall be conducted in relative privacy by Officers of the\nsame gender as the inmate.\n6.  The Officer conducting the search shall direct the inmate to remove all\narticles of clothing and to stand clear of the clothing.  The Officer shall\nconduct a thorough visual examination of the unclothed inmate in\naccordance with his/her training and experience.  Examination shall be\nmade of casts, bandages, false teeth and artificial prostheses.  The\nOfficer shall issue verbal instructions to facilitate the search.  The Officer\nshall examine the inmate’s clothing by turning the articles inside out,\nchecking linings, cuffs, waistbands, seams, patches and collars.  The\nsoles, heels and interior of footwear shall be checked.\nWhen more than one inmate is being strip searched (e.g. at the end of a\nvisiting period or return from outside transportation) the supervising\nOfficer shall ensure that those inmates who have been searched do not\ncome in contact with those inmates who have not yet been searched.\n(Document no. 34 (“Milton Decl.”), Exs. G and H.)\n5\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 6 of 19\narraignment detainees were strip-searched without regard to the crimes for which they\nwere being held or whether they were individually suspected of carrying weapons,\ndrugs or other contraband.  (Id. ¶ 13.3)\nApproximately 927 people were held as pre-arraignment detainees during the\nclass period.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  In only one instance were drugs found as a result of a strip-\nsearch; that individual, however, had been brought in for possession of drugs with\nintent to distribute and is not part of the class in this case.  (Id. ¶ 17.)  In another\ninstance, a strip-search revealed “contraband,” namely, pierced nipple rings fused\ntogether such that they could not be removed by hand.  (Id.)  In no other instance\nduring the class period was a strip-search necessary to reveal drugs or contraband. \n(Id. ¶ 18.)  On three occasions drugs were found in a pre-arraignment detainee’s\nclothing or backpack during the booking process; these drugs would have been found\nwithout subjecting the individual to a strip-search.  (Id.)\nMacdonald has been the Franklin County Sheriff since 1993.  (Id. ¶ 1.)  As the\ntop official in the Sheriff’s Office, he has statutory control and responsibility, and is the\nfinal policymaker, for the FCJ.  (Id.)  He is also responsible for ensuring that the\n3  This particular practice is purportedly “disputed” by Defendants, who claim that\nthe documents Plaintiffs reference in this regard do not explicitly state that this was the\npolicy of the FCJ.  (See Defs.’ Facts at 6, ¶ 13.)  As Plaintiffs point out, however,\nDefendants never deny the allegation, i.e., that the strip-search policy applied to all\npre-arraignment detainees without regard to the crimes for which they were being held\nor whether they were individually suspected of carrying weapons, drugs or other\ncontraband.  (See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Further Support of Pls.’ Motion for Summ. J.\n(“Pls.’ Reply”) at 2.)  Moreover, the practice described by Plaintiffs comports with\nDefendants’ other admissions, e.g., that they maintained a policy throughout the class\nperiod of subjecting all pre-arraignment detainees to a strip-search and that all pre-\narraignment detainees were strip-searched pursuant to this policy.  (See id.)\n6\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 7 of 19\npolicies of the FCJ comply with the Constitution.  (Id.)  As for Byron, he has been \nSuperintendent of the FCJ since 1997.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  He is the chief administrative officer\nof the Sheriff’s Office and is in charge of operations at the FCJ.  (Id.)\nIt is undisputed that Macdonald issued and Byron implemented General Order\n506 which, as indicated, contained the written version of the strip-search policy that\nwas in place throughout the class period.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  It is also undisputed that Byron\nreviewed and supported the policy before it took effect.  (Id.)\nB.  Defendants’ Facts\nFor their part, Defendants point out that the FCJ was constructed in 1886 and\nwas originally built to house 66 prisoners, but, together with a 60-prisoner modular\naddition, eventually had a rated capacity of 126 prisoners.  (Defs.’ Local Rule 56.1\nStatement (hereinafter “Defs.’ Facts”) ¶ 1; Pls.’ Response to Defs.’ Local Rule 56.1\nStatement (hereinafter “Pls.’ Response”) ¶ 1.)  Defendants also aver that, during the\nclass period, the FCJ served as the sole jail and house of correction in Franklin County. \n(Defs.’ Facts ¶ 2; Pls.’ Response ¶ 2.)  In addition, Defendants state that the FCJ was\nused by most of the police departments in rural Franklin County to hold pre-\narraignment detainees pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 126, § 4 (“section 4”), as most\nlocal departments had no specific holding facilities of their own.  (Defs.’ Facts ¶ 13.)4\n4  Section 4, as Defendants point out, permits jails to hold pre-arraignment\ndetainees where local lockups are unavailable:\nJails shall be used for the detention of persons charged with crime and\ncommitted for trial, committed to secure their attendance as witnesses\nupon the trial of criminal causes, committed pursuant to a sentence upon\nconviction of crime or for any cause authorized by law, or detained or\n7\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 8 of 19\nOn February 26, 2007, the new Franklin County House of Correction (“FCHOC”)\nopened and replaced the FCJ.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  While the new FCHOC was built in the\nmodern “pod” style (two tiers of cells positioned within the perimeter of a common\ndayroom, which allows direct supervision of all cells), the FJC had been built in the\n“linear” style (cells lining corridors offering only indirect surveillance).  (Id. ¶ 5.)  In\naddition, the cells in the FCJ were 48 square feet, compared to 80 square feet at the\nnew FCHOC.  (Id. ¶ 6.)\nAs noted, Macdonald adopted the blanket strip-search policy for all pre-\narraignment detainees well prior to the class-period.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Defendants claim,\nhowever, that this was as a result of “institutional security issues” caused by the\n“archaic nature” of the FCJ and, moreover, that the policy was “intended to protect the\nsafety of both the inmates and the correctional officers.”  (Id.)  For example, Defendants\npoint out that three cells were used to handle pre-arraignment detainees within the\n“extremely tight” booking area (constructed in 1994), which also included a booking\ndesk.  (Id. ¶¶ 7, 9; Pls.’ Response ¶ 9.)  Defendants also indicate that, occasionally,\npre-arraignment detainees were held in the booking area “overnight.”  (Defs.’ Facts ¶\n11.)  Defendants state as well that most of the cells in the FCJ had bars -- instead of\ncommitted by the courts of the United States.  Jails may also be used for\nthe detention of persons arrested without a warrant and not admitted to\nbail pending appearance before the district court, provided that no\nadequately equipped lock-up established in accordance with the\nprovisions of section thirty-four of chapter forty is available for the\ndetention of such person.\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 126, § 4.\n8\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 9 of 19\nmetal doors with windows as in the new facility -- and, as a result, prisoners could\nreach out from the cells and, perhaps, pass around contraband.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Although\nDefendants admit that the record does not indicate a major contraband problem, they\nrefer to the handful of instances -- noted above in Plaintiffs’ Facts -- of contraband\nbeing confiscated from pre-arraignment detainees during the class period.  (Id. ¶¶ 24-\n28.)  Defendants also claim that contraband confiscated from detainees was not always\ndocumented or reported by correctional officers as required by policy.  (Id. ¶¶ 25-27.)\nWhile Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants’ characterizations of some of the\nfacts, they assume them true for purposes of their motion.  Plaintiffs note, however, that\nthe blanket strip-search policy was changed to a “reasonable suspicion” standard when\nthe new FCHOC opened in 2007.  (Id. ¶ 20; Pls.’ Response ¶¶ 14, 20.)  Plaintiffs also\nnote that as early as November 29,1999 -- i.e., nearly five years prior to the class\nperiod -- the FCJ policy was temporarily changed from the blanket strip-search policy to\na “reasonable suspicion” standard.  (Defs.’ Facts ¶ 15; Pls.’ Response ¶ 20.)5 \nHowever, this altered policy was short-lived; on December 3, 1999, Macdonald\nchanged the policy back to require strip-searches of all pre-arraignment detainees, and\nthat was the policy in place during the class period.  (Defs.’ Facts ¶ 17.)\nC.  Procedural History\nThe instant case was filed on March 28, 2007, and proceeded in two stages. \nFirst, the parties engaged in class certification discovery and filed memoranda of law\n5  At his deposition, Macdonald testified that he adopted the temporary policy\nchange to avoid getting sued and because he thought it might be required by law. \n(Pls.’ Response ¶ 15.)\n9\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 10 of 19\nwith regard to Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  As indicated, that motion was\nallowed on April 15, 2008.  Second, the parties engaged in discovery on the merits and\nfiled the cross-motions for summary judgment presently before the court.  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n“Summary judgment is warranted ‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\na judgment as a matter of law.’”  Uncle Henry’s, Inc. v. Plaut Consulting Co., 399 F.3d\n33, 41 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(c).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ for\npurposes of summary judgment if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could\nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party, and a ‘material fact’ is one which might affect\nthe outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Carcieri v. Norton, 398 F.3d 22, 29\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citations and further internal quotation marks omitted).  The mere fact\nthat both parties move for summary judgment does not affect this standard, see Alliance\nof Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky, 430 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted)),\nparticularly where, as here, most of the facts are undisputed, Littlefield, 392 F.3d at 6.\nIII.  DISCUSSION\nAs indicated, two questions are at the core of the parties’ motions:  (1) whether\nthe strip-search policy was unconstitutional and (2) even if the policy was\nunconstitutional, whether qualified immunity bars this action against Defendants.  In the\ncourt’s opinion, the answer to the first question is “yes,” the policy was unconstitutional,\nand the answer to the second question is “no,” Defendants are not protected by\n10\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 11 of 19\nqualified immunity.\nA.  Whether the Policy is Unconstitutional\nThe general rule in this circuit appears to now be that strip-searches of all\nmisdemeanor arrestees require reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed or\nconcealing contraband.  See United States v. Barnes, 506 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2007)\n(citing cases).  See also Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st\nCir. 2003) (“Our case law holds that an individual detained on a misdemeanor charge\nmay be strip searched as part of the booking process only if officers have reasonable\nsuspicion that he is either armed or carrying contraband.”); Roberts v. Rhode Island,\n239 F.3d 107, 110-11 (1st Cir. 2001) (“at least in the context of prisoners held in local\njails for minor offenses,” officers must “have a reasonable suspicion that a particular\ndetainee harbors contraband prior to conducting a strip or visual body cavity search”)\n(citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), and Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 1997)).  The need for reasonable suspicion stems from the recognition by the First\nCircuit that strip-searches “impinge seriously upon Fourth Amendment values,” are “a\nsevere if not gross interference with a person’s privacy,” and are “an offense to the\ndignity of the individual” as well as “an extreme intrusion on personal privacy.” \nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 110 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nDefendants do not claim, nor is there any evidence, that the strip-searches of\nthe class members were conducted based on any reasonable, individualized suspicion. \nNor is there any claim or evidence that any class member was armed or suspected of\nconcealing contraband.  As noted, the class has been narrowly defined to include only\n11\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 12 of 19\npre-arraignment detainees arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs,\ncontraband or a violent felony.\nIn the court’s view, the handful of “problem” detainees identified through\ndiscovery have no bearing on the legal issues presented by the parties.  These\ndetainees consist of only (1) three individuals upon whom drugs were found without the\nneed for a strip-search, (2) one individual with exceptionally unique, and minor,\n“contraband,” i.e., fused nipple rings, and (3) one other individual who had smuggled\ndrugs on his body but who is not a member of the class.  Even assuming that there may\nhave been other “undocumented” problems with contraband, as Defendants suggest,\nDefendants admit that there were no major reported contraband problems. \nAccordingly, the searches seem to be clearly unconstitutional under established First\nCircuit precedent.\nTo be sure, it appears that blanket strip-search policies may be deemed\nconstitutional in this circuit if there are “compelling” institutional concerns.  See\nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 110-11.  Defendants make that assertion here, pointing to the\nfollowing concerns:  institutional security issues; the condition of the booking area; the\ncontraband issues; intermingling; overcapacity issues; the multipurpose FCJ facility;\nthe unavailability of alternatives for housing pre-arraignment detainees; and the\ninterplay between section 4 and the lack of local lockups in rural Franklin County.  As\nPlaintiffs point out, however, Defendants “concerns,” in fact, are far weaker than those\nthe First Circuit itself rejected in Roberts.  Id. at 112 (finding unconstitutional the strip-\nsearching of all pre-arraignment detainees charged with misdemeanors not associated\n12\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 13 of 19\nwith weapons or contraband, even though detainees were held in a maximum security\nfacility -- with a lengthy, documented history of contraband -- and freely intermingled\nwith the general prison population).  Moreover, as Roberts explained, “[a]n\nindiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied . . . can not be justified simply on the\nbasis of administrative ease in attending to security concerns.”  Id. at 113 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\nIt should also be noted that several of Defendants’ concerns have little or no\nfactual support or are simply irrelevant.  For example, the so-called “contraband”\nproblems, as indicated, are exceedingly small in number and easily distinguishable. \nSimilarly, although Defendants consistently refer to the booking area as being\n“extremely tight,” Defendants have not offered evidence of a single incident between\n1994, when the booking area was constructed, and 2007, when the FCHOC opened, in\nwhich an inmate ever “reach[ed] over to the booking desk and grab[bed] whatever\nitems were placed on the desk.”  (Defs.’ Facts ¶ 9.)  Thus, it is of no moment that there\nwere occasional instances of pre-arraignment detainees being held in the booking area\n“overnight.”6  It is also immaterial that section 4 permitted the FCJ to house pre-\narraignment detainees alongside other inmates; as noted, such intermingling concerns,\nstanding alone, have not caused the First Circuit to condone a blanket strip-search\npolicy.  See, e.g., Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110-11.\n6  In any event, as Plaintiffs point out, on only about one percent of the class\nperiod days were there more than five pre-arraignment detainees.  (Pls.’ Response ¶\n11.)  To be sure, Defendants note that two of the five booking area cells were used to\nstore records.  (Defs.’ Facts ¶¶ 7, 8.)  But there is no evidence that these records could\nnot have been stored elsewhere.  (See Pls.’ Response ¶ 8.)\n13\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 14 of 19\nFinally, Defendants’ argument that Gilanian v. City of Boston, 431 F. Supp. 2d\n172 (D. Mass. 2006), represented a “sharp turn” in this district’s strip-search law is\nmisplaced.  First, Defendants’ argument to the contrary, Gilanian explicitly relied on\nRoberts in describing the framework for analyzing blanket strip-search policies (id. at\n176); thus, Defendants’ reference to “Gilanian factors” is puzzling.  Second, Gilanian\ninvolved the denial of summary judgment to a plaintiff who was strip-searched while\nbeing detained on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, a violent felony.  The\ninstant class excludes those charged with violent felonies or any crimes associated with\nweapons or contraband.\nAs a result, the first question raised by the parties is easy to answer in the\naffirmative given the undisputed fact that all pre-arraignment detainees were strip-\nsearched without regard to:  where in the facility they would be housed; whether they\nwould come into contact with other inmates; the crimes for which they were being held;\nor whether they were individually suspected of carrying weapons, drugs, or other\ncontraband.  In short, the FCJ strip-searches were unconstitutional when applied to the\nclass.  Accordingly, the court turns to the second question addressed by the parties,\nqualified immunity.\nB.  Whether Defendants are Entitled to Qualified Immunity\nThe answer to the qualified immunity question also favors Plaintiffs.  To set the\nstage, the court first quotes liberally from District Judge Richard G. Stearns’ opinion in\nDeToledo v. County of Suffolk, 379 F. Supp. 2d 138 (D. Mass. 2005), itself a strip-\nsearch case:\n14\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 15 of 19\nQualified immunity attaches to discretionary conduct of\ngovernment officials that “does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  “[T]he qualified\nimmunity inquiry . . . allows . . . for the inevitable reality that\n‘law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but\nmistakenly conclude that [their conduct] is [constitutional],\nand . . . that . . . those officials like other officials who act in\nways they reasonably believe to be lawful -- should not be\nheld personally liable.’”  Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53\nF.3d 1367, 1373 (1st Cir. 1995), quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987).  “The qualified\nimmunity standard ‘gives ample room for mistaken\njudgments' by protecting ‘all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.’”  Rivera v. Murphy,\n979 F.2d 259, 263 (1st Cir. 1992), quoting Hunter v. Bryant,\n502 U.S. 224, 229 (1991) (per curiam).\nIn deciding whether qualified immunity attaches, “a\ncourt must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged\n[the] deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all.” \nConn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999).  Stated more\nformally, the “threshold” question is this:  “Taken in the light\nmost favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts\nalleged show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional\nright? . . .  If no constitutional right would have been violated\nwere the allegations established, there is no necessity for\nfurther inquiries concerning qualified immunity.”  Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).  Only if a violation of a right\nis found does the court proceed to answer the two remaining\nquestions:  was the right clearly established when the\nplaintiff suffered the constitutional injury; and if so, “whether\na reasonable prison official, situated similarly to the\ndefendants, would have understood at the time that the\npolicy in place . . . transgressed the Constitution.”[7]  Savard\n7  As Judge Stearns pointed out:\n“The right in question, . . . cannot be simply a generalized right, like the\nright to due process. . . .  It must be clearly established in a\n‘particularized’ sense, so that ‘the contours of the right’ are clear enough\nfor any reasonable official in the defendant's position to know that what\n15\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 16 of 19\nv. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2003).\nDeToledo, 379 F. Supp. 2d at 146-47.  To summarize, courts in strip-search cases\nfollow the familiar three-part qualified immunity inquiry:  (1) have the plaintiffs alleged a\ndeprivation of an actual constitutional right; (2) was the right clearly established when\nthe plaintiffs suffered the constitutional injury; and (3) if so, would a reasonable prison\nofficial, situated similarly to the defendants, have understood at the time that the policy\nin place transgressed the Constitution.  Id. at 147 (citing, inter alia, Saucier, 533 U.S. at\n210).  See also Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818 (Jan. 21, 2009) (affirming the\n“beneficial” and “appropriate” Saucier sequential analysis for most qualified immunity\ncases).\nHere, Plaintiffs have satisfied the first step in the sequential analysis.  Not only\nhave they alleged but they have shown that Defendants’ blanket strip-search policy at\nthe FCJ during the class period, implemented without individualized, reasonable\nsuspicion, was unconstitutional, i.e., it deprived Plaintiffs of their Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches.  See also id. (“Courts share the\nthe official is doing violates that right.”  Danese v. Asman, 875 F.2d 1239,\n1242 (6th Cir. 1989).  As a rule, a right is “clearly established” when it is\nenunciated by a court of controlling authority in the defendant's\njurisdiction in a case sufficiently similar in its facts “that a reasonable\nofficer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.”  Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U.S. 603, 617 (1999).  See also Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,\n253 F.3d 137, 144-145 (1st Cir. 2001) (relevant state, as well as federal\ndecisions should be considered).  While “general statements of the law\nare not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,” they do so\nonly if their application to a specific set of facts is clear.  United States v.\nLanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997).\nDeToledo, 379 F. Supp. 2d at 147 n.14.\n16\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 17 of 19\nconsensus view that a strip and visual body cavity search is a severe and degrading\nintrusion into personal privacy and bodily integrity, and if conducted without some\nreasonable basis, violates the Fourth Amendment.”) (citing Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110,\n113).  \nPlaintiffs have also satisfied the second question in the sequential analysis,\nnamely, that their rights to be free of a suspicionless strip-search were clearly\nestablished on March 28, 2004.  See id.  In fact, in Ford v. Suffolk County, 154 F. Supp.\n2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001), a case challenging a similar strip-search policy, District Judge\nNancy Gertner concluded that the right to be free of such searches was clearly\nestablished on June 25, 1997, when the First Circuit in Swain held that a strip-search of\nan arrestee “ordinarily” requires a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband, weapons, or evidence on her person.   See DeToledo, 379 F. Supp. 2d at\n147.  To be sure, the question of whether “Swain settled the strip search issue in this\nCircuit with respect to pretrial detainees, as Judge Gertner thought in Ford, [was]\nthrown into doubt by subsequent First Circuit cases.”  Id. at 148.  But, for the reasons\nwhich follow, that question appears to have been resolved, at least with regard to the\ninstant class.\nIn DeToledo, upon which Defendants rely, the issue was whether, as of July of\n1998, a reasonable corrections officer would have known that conducting a strip search\nof a nonviolent felony arrestee pursuant to a longstanding institutional policy would\nviolate the Constitution.  Id. at 149.  Although Judge Stearns observed that a\nreasonable corrections officer would not then have had such knowledge, he suggested\n17\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 18 of 19\nthat the result would have been different if the defendants were higher-ranking officials\nresponsible for setting policy.  See id. at 149 & n.16.  Thus, Defendants’ argument to\nthe contrary, DeToledo actually strengthens Plaintiffs’ position here.  Since the law was\nlikely clearly established in 1998 with respect to policy-setting officials, Defendants,\nbeing the very type officials cited by Judge Stearns, have no grounds upon which to\nargue that, based on DeToledo, they were qualifiedly immune in 2004, six years later.\nNor can Defendants rely on District Judge George O’Toole’s decision in Doe v.\nPreston, 472 F. Supp. 2d 16 (D. Mass. 2007), which granted qualified immunity to\nofficials of a juvenile youth facility.  That case was admittedly unique; it involved the\nnovel “question of routine, suspiciousless strip searches of juveniles committed to state\ncustody,” for whom the state acts in loco parentis, not the more common strip-searches\nof adults “recently arrested for relatively minor offenses who are held in temporary\ndetention facilities housing persons unlikely to have any incentive or opportunity to\nsmuggle contraband into the facility, see Roberts, 239 F.3d at 107, and Swain, 117\nF.3d 1.”  Doe, 472 F. Supp. 2d at 25, 27.  Further, the time period at issue in Doe was\n“late 2002 and the first quarter of 2003,” id. at 25, a full year prior to the beginning of\nthe class period here.\nTrue, in Savard, which was decided on August 4, 2003, the en banc First Circuit,\nby a split 4-4 vote, allowed certain prison officials to receive qualified immunity for\nsimilar blanket strip-searches prior to March 17, 2000 (the last date the policy there\nwas in effect).  But even those judges who invoked the immunity clearly stated that\nsuch a strip-search policy “is now dead and buried.”  Id., 338 F.3d at 33 (emphasis\n18\n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN     Document 49      Filed 10/22/2009     Page 19 of 19\nadded).  Accordingly, the measuring date of August 4, 2003, is firmly established for\nqualified immunity purposes here.\nIn sum, the court agrees with Plaintiffs that the third question in the sequential\nanalysis has been satisfied, i.e., that any reasonable corrections official similarly\nsituated to Defendants by March 28, 2004, the beginning of the class period here,\nshould have known that a policy of strip-searching all pre-arraignment detainees such\nas those in the instant class, was unconstitutional.  As a result, Defendants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nThis case has brought to light an unfortunate policy at the now-retired FCJ, that\nof unconstitutionally strip-searching all pre-arraignment detainees charged with minor\noffenses not involving weapons or contraband between March 28, 2004, and February\n25, 2007, a policy for which Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.

INTRODUCTION \nThe parties to this civil rights class action have reached a settlement in which Defendants will \npay $1,162,468, subject to reversion, to resolve all claims of a class of 486 individuals. After \npayment of claims administration expenses, litigation expenses, an incentive award to the class \nrepresentative, and attorneys' fees, the remaining settlement fund balance will be evenly divided \namong participating class members up to a cap of$3,500 per person. Ifthere are any remaining funds \nafter distribution to claimants, half of those funds  will  be  given to Prisoners'  Legal Services \n(formerly Massachusetts Correctional Legal Services) under the doctrine of cy pres, and half will \nrevert to the Commonwealth. \nThe settlement is the product of intensive arm's length negotiations, and it is substantively \nfair, reasonable, and adequate. The parties have submitted a joint motion requesting that the Court \n(1) grant preliminary approval to the settlement, (2) appoint Analytics, Inc., as claims administrator, \n(3) approve the class notice and notice plan, and (4) set a date for a final fairness hearing and a date \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 2 of 18\nfor tiling motions to approve the settlement and for attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs submit this separate \nmemorandum to give the Court a full account, from Plainti fTs' perspective, of why the settlement \nis fair and beneficial to the class. \nII.  CASE BACKGROUND \nThis is a civil rights class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Franklin County Sheriff \nFrederick Macdonald and Special Sheriff Forbes Byron. Plaintiff, Gregory Garvey, Sr., tiled suit on \nMarch 28, 2007, alleging that Defendants maintained a policy of strip searching all individuals \nadmitted to the Franklin County Jail without individualized suspicion, in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment. This policy was in place throughout the class period, which runs from March 28,2004, \nto February 24, 2007, inclusive. On April 15, 2008, the Court certified the following class under Fed. \nR.Civ. P. 23(b)(3): \nAll people strip searched without individualized reasonable suspicion on or after \nMarch 28, 2004, and before February 25, 2007, at the Franklin County Jail \n(a)  while waiting for bail to be set or for a tlrst court appearance after being \narrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, contraband or a \nviolent felony, or \n(b)  while waiting for a tlrst court appearance after being arrested on a default \nor  other  warrant  for  charges  that  did  not  involve  a  weapon,  drugs, \ncontraband or a violent felony. \nThe parties conducted discovery from July 2007 to November 2008, after which they filed \ncross motions for summary judgment. On October 22, 2009, the Court granted PlaintifTs' motion for \nsummary judgment and denied Defendants'. \nFollowing the Court's ruling, the parties spent several months determining who was in the \nclass, a necessary precursor to negotiating a settlement. After extensive review of individual intake \n2 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 3 of 18\nfiles and ofthe applicable law, on or about March 25, 2010, the pmiies reached agreement as to who \nwas in the class and who was not The parties then began settlement discussions in earnest After \nseveral months of negotiations, the parties signed the settlement agreement on June 24, 2010, \nIII.  SUMMARY OF THE SETTLEMENT \nOn behalf of Defendants, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay $1,162,468, subject to \nreversion, to settle all claims brought by Plaintiffs in this action, including attorney's fees m1d costs. \nThe agreement provides for a cash payment of up to $3,500 to every person who meets the class \ndefinition and submits a claim form. The parties have determined that there are 486 class members. \nOnly one payment will be made to each class member no matter how many times during the class \nperiod he or she was admitted into the jail and strip searched. \nClass counsel recommends, and Defendants do not oppose, an incentive payment of$20,000 \nto the named plaintiff, Gregory Garvey, Sr., to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a result of \nbringing this case and for the time he spent working with counsel to bring about the favorable result \nfor the class. While the parties have no agreement with regard to attorneys' fees, class counsel will \nrequest that the Court award a fee of one-third of the gross settlement amount. Fees and expenses, \nincluding the costs of administering the settlement, will be deducted from the settlement amount \nbefore calculating the distribution amount to class members. \nAfter the above payments are deducted from the total settlement amount, each class member \nwho has submitted a valid claim form will receive an equal share ofthe remaining amount, up to a \ncap of$3,500. [fmoney is left over after every participating class member receives a payment, then \none-half of this amount will be given to Prisoners' Legal Services under the doctrine of cy pres, and \nhalf will revert to the Commonwealth. \n3 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 4 of 18\niV.  THE COURT SHOULD PRELiMiNARiLY APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT AND \nNOTICE PLAN AND SET A DATE FOR A FAIRNESS HEARING \nIn deciding whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action, the Court must hold \na hearing and determine whether the settlement is \"fair, reasonable and adequate.'\"  At this stage, the \nCourt should make a \"preliminary determination ofthe fairness, reasonableness and adequacy oft he \nsettlement terms.  The Court should also review the reasonableness of the proposed notices, \n,,2 \nattached to the  Settlement Agreement as Exhibits A and  C, and notice plan. This provisional \napproval is subject to a more searching inquiry at the fairness hearing. \"If the parties  negotiated at \narm's length and conducted sutlicient discovery, the district court must presume the settlement is \nreasonable.'\" \nA.  The Settlement Is Procedurally Fair \n1.  The negotiations occurred at arm's length. \nThis settlement is the result of vigorous negotiations. After the Court granted summary \njudgment in October 2009, the parties began to discuss settlement. As a threshold matter, the \nparties needed to know the size of the class, which in turn required the parties to agree on who \nmet the class definition. This process alone took several months. After determining class size, the \nparties negotiated for several months before agreeing on all terms of the written settlement \nagreement. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); Howe v.  Townsend, 588 F.3d 24. 32 (1st Cir. 2009). \nI \nSee Hochstadt v.  Basion Sci. Corp., 2010 U.S.  Dis!. LEXIS 41007, at *32 (D. Mass. Apr. 27, \n2 \n2010)( citing Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth § 21.632 (2004». \nHowe, 588 F.3d at 32-33; see also Hochstadt, 2010 U.S. Dis!. LEXIS 41007, at *32 \n3 \n4 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 5 of 18\n2.  The parties engaged in full discovery. \n\"[T]he stage of the proceedings at which settlement is reached is important because it \nindicates how fully the district court and counsel are able to evaluate the merits of PlaintitJs' \nc1aims.,,4 Plaintiffs in this case had the benefit of a complete discovery period, and a ruling on the \nmerits from the Court, before entering into the settlement. \nPlaintiffs took extensive discovery both on the merits oftheir claims and on the composition \nof the class. Plaintiffs took twelve depositions, sent document requests, and propounded two sets of \ninterrogatories to each Defendant. Plaintiffs' counsel reviewed multiple complex spreadsheets and \nvoluminous paper booking records. \nDuring discovery, PlaintifJs identified approximately 580 individuals as likely to fit the class \ndefinition based on Defendants' records. To anive at the tInal class list, Defendants reviewed the \nintake files  and other materials for nearly all of these individuals. Plaintiffs' connsel, in turn, \nreviewed the materials Defendants provided from these  fjles that allegedly disqualified certain \nindividuals from the class. The parties also conducted legal research to determine, among other \nthings, whether particular crimes should be deemed \"violent felonies.\" As a result of this intensive \nreview process, the paIiies agreed that 486 individuals met the class definition. \nB.  The Settlement Is Substantively Fair and Reasonable \nCourts recognize a policy in favor of settlement of class actions.' Settlement of this ease will \nprevent expenditure of significant time and resources by the parties and the Court, eliminate the risks \nto all parties of proceeding to a trial on damages, and provide a substantial benefit to class members. \n4Rollandv. Cellucci, 191  F.R.D. 3,10 (D. Mass. 2000) (citation omitted). \n, See, e.g., Howe v.  Townsend, 588 F.3d 24, 36 (I st Cir. 2009); Durrett v. Housing Auth. of \nProvidence, 896 F.2d 600, 604 (I st Cir. 1990). \n5 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 6 of 18\nThe Court should examine the amount of recovery as well as the plan for distributing the recovery \nto class members in order to determine whether the proposed monetary settlement is fair, reasonable \nand adequate. \"[I]n any case, there is a range of reasonableness with respect to a settlement.,,6 The \nsettlement in this case is well within that range. \n1.  The settlement provides a significant benefit to the class. \nThe total value of the settlement is $1,162,468. Unless an exceptionally high propOliion of \nclass members submit claims. each participating class member is likely to receive the maximum \nindividual payment amount of $3,500.  By any measure, this is  more than a token recovery. \nParticipating class members will receive a significant cash payment for filling out a short form and \nmailing it to the claims administrator. These class members will obtain money without having to find \nand hire their own lawyers. pay litigation expenses, endure the anxiety of litigation, respond to \ninterrogatories or requests for documents, testify at depositions, and prepare for trials. Instead of \ngiving up their privacy by filing suit or participating in a damages hearing, they will benefit from the \nanonymity provided by their membership in the class. \nClass counsel anticipates that each participating class member will  receive the $3,500 \nmaximum payment, or an amount close thereto. If the Court approves the attorneys' fees and costs \nrequested by class counsel, including the costs of claims administration, the estimated minimum \namount available for distribution to class members will be $710,000. There are 486 class members. \nIEup to 202 people, or 41.6% of the class, submit claim forms, then each claimant will receive the \n$3,500 maximum. Even assuming a 50% participation rate - which would be extraordinary for a \ncivil rights class action like this one - each claimant would receive an estimated $2,920. While class \n(, In re Relafen Antitrust Lilig, 231 F.R.D. 52, 73 (D. Mass. 2005) (citing Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d \n689,693 (2d Cir. 1972)). \n6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 7 of 18\ncounsel will work to secure a high participation rate, a more realistic estimate of the participation \nrate is 25-30 %. In such a case, each class member would receive the full $3,500. Assuming a 30 \npercent participation rate (or  146 claimants), $511,000 would be distributed to the class, with \napproximately $200,000 remaining to  be  divided  between Prisoners'  Legal  Services  and  the \nCommonwealth. \nThe amount class members will receive under the settlement is well within the range of \nreasonableness for similar settlements in this state and nationwide. In Ryan v. Garvey, No. 05-30017-\nMAP, a case against the Hampshire Sheriffs Department settled in 2007, Judge Ponsor approved \na $205,000 settlement for 89 class members, 30 of whom filed claims. Each participating class \nmember received approximately $3,900.7 In 2009, a district court in Pennsylvania approved a \nsettlement that provided for all participating claimants to be granted a pro rata share of a settlement \nfund up to cap of$3,000 per class member; each claimant received approximately $1 ,4008  Tn 2006, \na New York district court approved a settlement granting $750 or $ 1,000 per class member; the \ncourt cited another strip-search class action in which claimants received $1,000 each and another in \nwhich claimants received an average of$ 3,800 per person.' \n2.  Class members risked getting less, or nothing, if the case went to trial. \nBy reaching a compromise, Plaintiffs avoid the risks they would have faced by proceeding \nto trial. Although this Court determined liability in Plaintiffs' favor, two recent decisions from other \ncircuits have presented the possibility that the Supreme Court may soon take up the issue of \nIn  addition to Ryan,  Plaintiffs'  counsel  has  settled  two  other strip search  class  actions  in \n7 \nMassachusetts, Mack v. Suffolk County. 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000), and Connor v.  Plymouth County, \n00-1 0835-RBC. See Affidavit of Howard Friedman (\"Friedman Aff.\") '\\[12. \nBoone v. City ofP  hi/a., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 702-03 (E.D. Pa. 2009). \nS \n, McBean v.  City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 388, 390-91 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). \n7 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 8 of 18\nprearraignment strip-searches, potentially overruling the First Circuit precedent on which this Court \nrelied. In Bull v.  City and County of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc), and \nPowell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (l1th Cir. 2008) (en bane), the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits held \nthat blanket strip searches of non-felons at the time of admission to jail are constitutional. By \nsettling, class members avoid any risk of losing on the merits because of future changes in the law. \nMoreover, if damages claims were decided individually by ajury, class mcmbers would risk \nwinning less  than  $3,500,  or winning only nominal  damages.'o  Particularly in this economic \nenvironment, juries may not feel generous to fonner arrestees. Individuals who believe they have \nstrong damages claims can opt out.\" \nSettling now also ensures that class members will receive payment much sooner than if the \ncase proceeded to trial and appeal. Receiving prompt payment is especially important in this case, \nwhere a significant portion of the class is poor and transient. Not only do many class members \npresumably need the money, but as time goes by, it will become increasingly difficult to contact \nthem.'2 \nSee, e.g., Foole v. Spiegel, 118 F.3d 1416 (10th Cir. 2(01) (after two appeals, plaintiff awarded \n10 \n$1  for an admittedly illegal strip search); Stewart v.  Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 154, n.2. (5th Cir. \n1985)(one plaintiff awarded $1  and the other awarded $15,000); Sorenson v.  City of New York,  2000 \nU.S.Dist. LEXIS 15090 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)(two plaintiffs awarded $1 each); Polkv. Montgomery County, 689 \nF.Supp. 556 (D. Md. 1988) (plaintiff awarded $1  after rejecting a settlement offer of $31,000). \n\" See McBean, 233 F.R.D. at 388 (\"Individual class members ean decide on their own where on the \nscale of damages they fall, from nominal to substantial. If on the nominal side, the settlement's award of $ \n750 or $ 1000 is quite attractive; if on the substantial side, the settlement allows individuals to opt out and \npursue their own claims.\"). \nSee id. (\"The prospect of a trial in this case, with the risk of receiving only nominal damages, and \n12 \nthe risk that during protracted litigation class members or become unreachable to collect even a nominal \namount, strongly favors settlement. \"). \n8 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 9 of 18\n3.  The distributiou formula is fair, reasonable and adequate. \nThe distribution formula in this case, which provides that each class member will receive the \nsame amount, is fair and reasonable. This simple, easy-to-administer formula preserves one of the \nprincipal benefits of this settlement - avoiding the expenditure of resources required to make \nhundreds of individual damages determinations. \nPlaintiffs' counsel has consulted with lawyers from around the country who have settled \nsimilar strip search class actions in other states. Experience bas shown that requiring individualized \ndeterminations of each class member's subjective experience to determine his or her share of the \nsettlement can be so time consuming and expensive that it harms the class as a whole.]] \nPeople who were anested more than once during the class period will not receive additional \npayments because it is unlikely that a jury would reward a person for being arrested several times. \nIndeed, ajury could decide that a strip search was less traumatic for a detainee who had been through \nthe search previously. \n4.  The cy pres distribution to Prisoners' Legal Services is appropriate. \nThe settlement agreement contemplates that half of any funds remaining after all participating \nclass members are paid will go to Prisoners' Legal Services, a nonprofit that provides direct legal \nservices to prisoners and detainees throughout the Commonwealth. The other halfwill revert to the \nCommonwealth. This is a fair and reasonable use of the leftover funds. \nThe First Circuit recently endorsed the use of cy pres fund in a class action settlement. In \nHowe v.  Townsend, the Court upheld a settlement agreement that provided that a portion of funds \nremaining after all class members submitted claims would go  to charitable organizations that \n\" Friedman AfT. 1 2 i. \n9 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 10 of 18\nindirectly benefitted the  class.'4 Howe was a consumer class action against a pharmaceutical \ncompany alleging artificial inflation of the price ofa prostate cancer drug; the cy pres moneys went \nto \"charitable organizations funding cancer research or patient care.\"\" The First Circuit noted that \n\"[t]he cy pres ... distributions serve the objectives of compensation for the class (albeit in an \nindirect manner), access to jndicial relieffor small claims, and deterrence of illegal behavior.\"'6 \nThe creation of the cy pres fund in this case is consistent not only with federal law and policy, \nbut also with the policy of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is paying for the settlement. \nMassachusetts recently amended its rules of civil procedure to explicitly provide for the donation of \nresidual funds in class actions to charitable organizations. The amended rule states that \"residual \nfunds shall be disbursed to one or more nonprofit organizations or foundations ... which support \nprojects that will benefit the class or similarly situated persons consistent with the objectives and \npurposes of the underlying causes of action on which relief was based, or to the Massachusetts \nIOLTA Committee.,,'7 \nIn this case, Prisoners' Legal Services will receive payment only after all class members who \nhave submitted claims have been paid the maximum individual compensation under the agreement, \n$3,500, and all expenses and fees have been paid. The agrecment states that any funds paid to \nPrisoners' Legal Services are to be used for \"provision of additional prisoners' legal services (i.e.: \nfor legal services not presently provided in its budget).\"\" Tbe funds will thus indirectly benefit class \nmembers who did not submit claims. \n14Howe v. Townsend, 588 F.3d 24 (I st CiT. 2009). \n151d. at 30. \n](, Id. at 34 (quoting 3 Conte & Newberg, 4 Newberg on Class Actions § 10: J 5, at 513 (4th ed. 2002)). \nMass. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2) (amendment effective January 1,2009). \n17 \n18 Agreement ~ 47. \n10 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 11 of 18\n5.  The attorneys' fees and expenses are reasonable. \nClass counsel will request attorneys' fees of one-third of the total settlement amount. plus \nlitigation and claims administration expenses. This is consistent with the fees awarded to counsel \nI\" \nin other similar strip search class action cases. \nThe fee is justified by the amount of work. skill, and expertise needed to settle this case with \nthe results achieved. Counsel will file a motion for attorney's fees and expenses under Fed. R.Civ.P. \n23(h) to be heard at the time of the fairness hearing. Counsel will provide the Court with a lodestar \nfigure for attorney's fees to verify the reasonableness of the percentage of fund method. \n6.  The proposed incentive award to the class representative is reasonable. \nClass counsel requests an incentive payment of $20,000 for class representative Gregory \nGarvey. Sr. The purpose of the award is to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a result of \nbringing this case and for the time he spent in responding to discovery and working with counsel to \nbenefit the entire class. Mr.  Garvey answered individual discovery requests and consulted with \ncounsel throughout the litigation. He filed two affidavits in support of summary judgment and \nattended the oral argument. Mr. Garvey endured a loss of his personal privacy by revealing his name \nto bring this lawsuit on behalf of the class. \nSee,  e.g., Mack, supra (awarding class counsel fees of 30% of a $10 million settlement fund); \n10 \nConnor,  supra (awarding class counsel fees of 33% of a $1.35  million settlement fund);  Eddleman v. \nJefferson County (awarding class counsel 33.3% of a $11.5 million settlement fund); Moser v. Anderson \n(awarding class counsel 33.3% of the $3 million settlement fund), cited in Friedman Affidavit 11'\\114-15, 18-\n19. \n11 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 12 of 18\n\"Incentive awards are recognized as serving an important fnnction in promoting class action \nsettlements, particularly where, as here, named plaintiffs actively participated in the litigation.  In \n,,20 \ngranting incentive awards, courts consider the efforts of plaintiffs in pursuing the claims and \"the \nimportant public policy of fostering enforcement oflaws and rewarding representative plaintiffs for \nbeing instrumental in obtaining recoveries for persons other than themselves.\"\" The dollar amount \nproposed for Mr. Garvey is in line with awards approved by other courts.\" \nAn incentive payment is especially appropriate for the named class representative here \nbecause Mr. Garvey sacrificed his privacy and subjected himself to embarrassment by admitting \npublicly that he was arrested and forced to strip naked as part of his detention injail.  IfMr. Garvey \n23 \nhad not come forward, class members would not known that their rights were violated and would \nnot have sought or received any compensation for their injury. Mr. Garvey deserves compensation \nfor efforts that helped achieve a substantial benefit for hundreds of people. \nC.

The notice plan is designed to reach as many class members \nas possible, not to simply meet minimum due process requirements. \n1.  Individual notice \n\"Individual notice must be sent to all class members whose names and addresses may be \nascertained through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs propose sending individual notice to each \n,,25 \nclass member based on the mailing address provided at booking unless the address has been \nupdated by the class member or obtained by an electronic scmch following the return of the \noriginal class notice mailing as undeliverable by the post otrice. \nIn addition to individual notice by mail, the agreement provides that Defendants shall \nhand deliver notice and a claim form to any class member in custody of the Franklin County Jail \nduring the period for filing claims. Defendants will provide a copy of the notice packet to any \ninmate upon request. \nThe Notice of Class Action and Proposed Settlement is attached to the Settlement \nMullane v.

The notice summarizes the terms of the settlement, describes the \noptions of each class member, discloses the incentive payment to the class representative, \ndiscloses the proposed amount of attorney's fees and expenses and explains that this issue will be \ndecided by the Court at the fairness hearing, gives the date, time and place of the fairness \nhearing, and provides contact information for any questions about the settlement. The notice is \ndrafted in plain English. This notice will be sent by first class mail, postage-prepaid, to all \npotential class members at their last known addresses within three weeks of the court's order \ngranting preliminary approval of the settlement. In addition, a \"generic notice\" - describing in \ngreater detail who is and who is not a class member - will be available along with a claim form \non the website, and to anyone who writes the Claims Administrator asking for more information \nabout the case. The generic notice and claim form are attached to the Agreement as Exhibits C \nandD. \n2.  Additional notices via media, pnblication, and posting at the jail \nIn order to reach as many class members as possible, the notice plan includes several \nadditional notices. First, because some class members may have moved without leaving a \nforwarding address, and because the class list may contain errors, the notice plan also includes \npublication of a settlement notice in two local newspapers. A notice, attached to the Settlement \nAgreement as Exhibit E, will be published in the Springfield Republican and the Greenfield \nRecorder. Second, the press will be notified of the settlement through the press release attached \nas Exhibit G, which is likely to result in news coverage of the settlement. The press release will \nbe sent to the Valley Advocate, the Springfield Republican, the Daily Hampshire Gazette, the \nGreenfield Recorder, the Associated Press, and several western Massachusetts radio and TV \n14 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 15 of 18\nstations. Class members are more likely to learn of this settlement through news coverage than \nthrough paid notices in newspapers.26 Third, Defendants have agreed to post notices, attached to \nthe Agreement as Exhibit F, in the Booking Room and in the Inmate Library of the Franklin \nCounty Jail. Finally, the class website that has already been established will provide information \nabout the settlement.27 The notices, forms and other information about the case will be posted to \nthe website. \nClass counsel also proposes to send notice to individuals who were previously identitled \nas potential class members but who have since been determined not to be class members. Based \non the information provided by Defendants at the time class notice was sent after class \ncertitlcation, Plaintiffs identified approximately 582 individuals as potential class members. \nNotice of the case was sent to these individuals with approval of the Court. Since then, it has \nbeen determined that approximately 100 individuals in this group do not meet the class \ndetlnition.28 Class counsel has prepared a notice explaining to these individuals why they do not \nmeet the class definition and informing them of their right to challenge this decision if they \nbelieve it was in error. The proposed notice is attached as Exhibit I to the affidavit of counsel \nsubmitted with this memorandum. \nV.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT \nClass counsel recommends that this Court appoint Analytics, Inc., as the claims \nadministrator. Analytics has more than 35 years' experience in administering class actions29 lt \nhas experience in processing settlements in strip search class actions, having handled the \nSee 3 Conte & Newberg § 8.38 (\"Traditional and expensive published notices ... are not efficient \n26 \nin serving the objectives ofc lass notice, iu contrast to radio and television announcements and discussions.\"). \nSee www.franklincountyjailclass.com. \n27 \nFriedman Aff.  24-25. \n28  ~~ \nFriedman Aff. 1 28. \n29 \n15 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 16 of 18\nadministration of cases nationwide. Class counsel has handled three other strip search class \nactions that were successfully administered by Analytics: the Nilsen strip-search class action in \nMaine and the Connor and Ryan cases in this District30 Magistrate Judge Collings recently \nappointed Analytics to be the claims administrator in another prisoners' rights class action \nhandled by class counsel, Tyler v.  Sujfi)lk County, 06-113S4-RBC (D. Mass.). \nThe payment to Analytics in this case is capped at $30,000, based on a detailed estimate \nthat the company provided to Class Counsel and that defense counsel also reviewed. \nVI.  PROPOSED SCHEDULE \nAppendix A at the end of this memorandum is a proposed schedule for the settlement \nprocess using the time periods in the Settlement Agreement. Based on this schedule, the fairness \nhearing would take place in January 2011 in order to allow sufficient time for all possible appeals \nof denied claims to be exhausted. Assuming that there are no unforeseen circumstances and that \nthe Court approves the settlement, distribution could begin shortly after final approval in January \n2011. \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request that the Court (I) grant preliminary approval \nto the settlement, (2) appoint Analytics, Inc., as claims administrator, (3) approve the class notice \nand notice plan, and (4) set a date for a final fairness hearing and a date for filing motions to \napprove the settlement and for attorneys' fees. \n30Id. \n]6 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 17 of 18\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \nFor the Plaintiffs, \n/s/ Howard Friedman \nHoward Friedman, BBO #180080 \nDavid Milton, BBO #668908 \nLaw Offices of Howard ~Friedman P.c. \n90 Canal Street, 5th Floor \nBoston, MA 02114-2022 \nT (617) 742-4100 \nhfriedman@civil-rights-law.com \ndmilton@civil-rights-law.com \nDated: June 24, 2010 \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI certify that on this day I caused a true copy of the above \ndocument to be served upon the attorney of record for all parties via ECF. \nDate: June 24, 2010  lsi Howard Friedman \nHoward friedman \n17 \n\nCase 3:07-cv-30049-KPN   Document 59   Filed 06/24/10   Page 18 of 18\nAPPENDIX A \nChronology of Anticipated Dates for Completing the Settlement Process \n..<  ... \nNEl1V!\\~1NB:ErR  I  CALcDuAiA.TTET f)' ,N,  '  >.  ....  .......  .lJOEFS CEIVUEIN'TTI ON.  .. ...  .. .•..•......•••  >.. ......•.•....
