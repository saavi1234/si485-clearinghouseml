The plaintiff alleged that under the policy, all misdemeanor and minor offense arrestees were strip-searched without reasonable suspicion that they were concealing weapons or other contraband.  Plaintiff alleged the policy violated the Fourth Amendment and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification. </p><p>This case, Iaffaldano v. County of Nassau, 99-CV-4238, was one of three cases filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the blanket strip search policy of the Nassau County Correctional Center.  The other two cases were <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9622\">O'Day v. Nassau County</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9514\">Augustin v. Jablonsky</a>. Plaintiffs in all three cases moved to consolidate the cases and for class certification of a class defined as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.\"   The District Court (District Judge Denis J. Hurley) consolidated the cases, but denied class certification. Augustin v. Jablonsky, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D. N.Y. Mar. 08, 2001).</p><p>See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9514\">Augustin v. Jablonsky</a> for the summary of proceedings occurring after the consolidation of the three cases.</p><p>On April 10, 2014, the Eastern District of New York entered final judgment for the defendant on federal constitutional claims and for the plaintiff class on state constitutional claims, awarding $11,508,000 in damages as well as attorney's fees to the plaintiff class. 2014 WL 1338426.  On appeal, the court upheld the District Court ruling.  Defendants filed a  writ of certiorari to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it was denied on October 12, 2106.  </p><p>The case is closed. </p>",

Hurley, Judge), denying plaintiffs' repeated class certification motions \n32  for lack of common issue predominance.  The District Court expressed \"considerable doubt\" as \n33  to whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A) when it \n34  already had determined that plaintiffs' claints as a whole failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 2 of 21\n1  predominance requirement.  The District Court further concluded that, even if it could do so, \n2  common liability issues that defendants had conceded no longer factored into the predominance \n3  analysis.  The District Court thus denied plaintiffs' motion to certifY a class on the issue of \n4  liability. \n5  We hold that (I) district courts may certifY a class on a particular issue regardless of \n6  whether plaintiffs' claims, as a whole, satisfY the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred \n7  when it excised common liability issues from it.~ predominance analysis due to defendants' \n8  concession; and, as a result, (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in declining \n9  to certifY a class on the issue ofliability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A). \n10  REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART. \nll \n12  ROBERT L.

Goodman, County Attorney \n22  of Nassau County, David B. Goldin, Deputy County Attorney, on the brief), Mineola, \n23  NY, for Defendants-Appellees. \n24 \n25  STRAUB, Circuit Judge: \n26  This appeal is the latest installment in a series of litigations over the Nassau County \n27  Correctional Center's (\"NCCC\") blanket strip search policy for newly admitted, misdemeanor \n28  detainees (\"the policy\").  Plaintiffs, who were strip searched pursuant to the policy, appeal from a \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 3 of 21\nseries of orders entered in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis J. \n2  Hurley, Judge) denying their repeated motions for class certification on the ground that \n3  individual issues predominated over common ones. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring that \n4  \"questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions \n5  affecting only individual members\"). \n6  During the course of class certification motion practice, plaintiffs requested that the \n7  District Court certifY a Rule 23(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, as permitted by Rule \n8  23(c)(4)(A).  In response, defendants conceded their liability to plaintiffs.  The District Court \n9  denied the motion.  As an initial matter, the District Court expressed serious doubt over whether \nI 0  it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that plaintiffs' \n11  claims, as a whole, failed the predominance test.  Even if it could do so, the District Court \n12  reasoned that defendants' concession removed common liability issues from the predominance \n13  analysis.  With common liability issues so excised, the Court concluded that individual liability \n14  issues, such as the application of an affirmative defense, predominated.  The Court thus denied \n15  plaintiffs' motions for class certification on the issue ofliability. \n16  The precise issues on appeal are whether ( 1) a court may certifY a Rule 23(b) (3) class as \n17  to a particular issue when it already has d-etermined that the claim as a whole fails the \n18  predominance test; (2) common issues that are conceded remain part of the predominance \n19  analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certifY a class \n20  on the issue of liability.  As set fortb mor<! fully below, we hold that (1) a court may employ rule \n21  23(c )(4 )(A) to certifY a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies \n22  the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred when it concluded that defendants' concession \n3 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 4 of 21\neliminated liability issues from the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its \n2  allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules \n3  23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).  Accordingly, we reverse the District Court's orders dated September 23, \n4  2003 and November 7, 2003 to the extent that they deny certification as to the issue ofliability, \n5  and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n6  BACKGROUND \n7  In 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that defendants' \n8  blanket policy of strip searching newly admitted, misdemeanor detainees violated clearly \n9  established Fourth Amendment law.  See Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), \n10  a.ff'd,  273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).  Although the policy has never been formally enjoined, Shain \n11  v, Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacating injunction for lack of standing), defendant~ \n12  assert that following the District Court's 1999 decision, they ceased implementing it. \n13  Shortly after the District Court's 1999 decision, plaintiffs brought three separate actions \n14  in the Eastern District of New York: Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 0 'Day et al. v. \n15  Nassau County SherifFs Department, et al., No. 99 Civ. 2844, and Ja.ffaldano v. County of \n16  Nassau, No. 99 Civ. 4238.  Together, plaintiffs named as defendants Nassau County, Sheriff \n17  Joseph P. Jablonsky, the Sheriffs Department, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the \n18  Division of Corrections, the Port Washington Police District and its chief of police, William \n19  Ki!fbil, and up to 200 subordinate John and Jane Doe corrections officers. \n20  Each action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to \n21  weapons or drugs and thereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion, pursuant to the \n22  policy.  Plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, the Fourth, Fifth, \n4 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 5 of 21\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 12 \n2  of the New York State Constitution.  They sought compensatory and punitive damages, a \n3  declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and an injunction barring enforcement of the \n4  policy.  They also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action. \n5  In February of2000, plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified \n6  class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).'  Plaintiffs defined the class as tollows: \"[A]ll persons arrested \n7  for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County \n8  Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.\"  In an \n9  opinion and order dated March 8, 200 I, the District Court granted that branch of the motion \n10  seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification.  See Augustin v. \n11  Jabolonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2001). \n12  The District Court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of \n13  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n14  However, it denied certification for Jack of common issue predominance.  The Court recognized \n15  certain common questions, namely, (I) whether defendants maintained a blanket strip search \n16  policy; (2) whether that policy was unconstitutional; and (3) whether some or all defendants may \n17  be held liable.  Nonetheless, it determined that individualized issues predominated, in particular: \n18  ( 1) whether subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants might escape liability in some cases \n19  because, notwithstanding the blanket policy, they had reasonable suspicion to search certain \n20  detainees; (2) the existence of proximate โข:ausation for each alleged injury; and (3) compensatory \n'Because motion practice on the question of class certification continued in various \niterations for more than four years, we describe only those aspects of the District Court's \ndecisions that are relevant to our own. \n5 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 6 of 21\nand punitive damages calculations. \n2  The District Court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue \n3  of liability pursuant to Rule 23( c)( 4}(A), which allows for class certification \"with respect to \n4  particular issues.\" It declined to do so because it did not wish to \"undertake plaintiffs' burden\" \n5  to \"craft and submit a proposal,\" and because, as a legal matter, it perceived \"considerable doubt \n6  as to the propriety of using Rule 23(c)(4)(A) in this fashion.\" In particular, the Court relied on \n7  Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that courts may not \n8  employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to single out tht' issue ofliability for class treatment unless the \"cause \n9  of action, as a whole,\" first satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.  Id. at 745 n.21 \n10  (emphasis added by District Court). \nII  Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.  They first asserted that they would no longer seek \n12  judgment against subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants.  Since that modification would \n13  render the question of liability identical for nearly all class members, plaintiffs next asserted that \n14  the Court should certify a class on the issue ofliability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A).  They again \n15  defined the class as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been \n16  admitted to the [Nassau County Correctional Center] and strip searched without particularized \n17  reasonable suspicion.\" \n18  In an opinion and order dated May 23, 2001, the Court agreed that plaintiffs' forbearance \n19  of their claims against subordinate defendants \"removes the possibility of individualized liability \n20  determinations.\"  ''To be sure,\" the Court acknowledged, \"the absence of individualized \n21  questions of liability militates in fkvor of partial certification solely on that issue.\" It \n22  nevertheless denied the motion. \n6 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 7 of 21\nl  The District Court again noted its \"concern that partial certification might not be \n2  appropriate in the first instance where th(~ cause of action, as a whole, does not satisfY the \n3  predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\" \"Even assuming\" that Rule 23(c)(4)(A) could be \n4  used in that fashion, the Court detried the motion because plaintiffs' proposed class definition \n5  \"would necessitate mini-trials just to determine class membership.\" In order to detemtine class \n6  membership, the Court believed, each would-be class member would have to show affirmatively \n7  that he was strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion - a criterion that the \n8  defmition incorporated.  This burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that \n9  they had ceased the blanket strip search policy after the Eastern District's 1999 decision in Shain, \nI 0  and thereafter conducted strip searches only with particularized reasonable suspicion. \nII  In January 2003, plaintiffs renewe:d their motion for class certification as to liability and \n12  offered a new defmition of the class as follows: \"[A]II persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-\n13  criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searehed at the NCCC pursuant to \n14  defendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-\n15  searched upon admission to the facility ....\"   (alterations incorporated).  By referring only to the \n16  \"blanket policy,\" this new defmition did not require plaintiffs to show that reasonable suspicion \n17  was absent in each case, and it excluded individuals strip searched after the 1999 Shain decision, \n18  when defendants ceased implementing the policy.  Plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew \n19  their claims against individual John and Jane Doe corrections officers. \n20  In response, defendants conceded \"the one common issue\" that in their view \"might be \n21  appropriate for class certification ... namely, whether the NCCC' s strip search policy during the \n22  class period was constitutional.\"  (alterations incorporated).  Specifically, defendants recognized \n7 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 8 of 21\nI  that they \"are bound by Shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\" \n2  The District Court denied the renewed motion.  In an opinion and order dated September \n3  23, 2003, the Court determined that defendants' concession removed all common liability issues \n4  from its predominance analysis.  Accordingly, the only liability issue that remained was an \n5  individual one: whether, notwithstanding the policy, some plaintiffs were searched based upon \n6  \"reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.\" \"With the liability issue thus \n7  circumscribed,\" the Court wrote, \"certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.\" \n8  Interestingly, the Court recognized that the individualized '\"reasonable suspicion inquiries' will \n9  be de minimis\" for two reasons: because defendants conceded that \"such an inquiry will only be \n10  sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs,\" and because pursuant to United States v. Colon, \n11  250 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2001), reasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law \n12  enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed. \n13  Plaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on October 2, 2003.  In an opinion and order \n14  dated November 7, 2003, the District Court adhered to its earlier determinations and also \n15  concluded-for the first time  that for the same reasons informing its predominance analysis, \n16  plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements, specifically, that the \n17  proposed class action be \"superior to oth<~r available methods for the fair and efficient \n18  adjudication of the controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In one last effort to \"determine if its \nI 9  decision was in some other way improper,\" the Court examined the policies of efiiciency and \n20  uniformity animating Rule 23, and concluded that they did not favor certification.  The Court \n21  also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little trouble securing counsel to pursue their \n22  claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide the necessary economic \n8 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 9 of 21\n1  incentive, \n2  The parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of $350,000 \n3  to the ten plaintiffs, who agreed to split the funds equally.  Plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal \n4  the District Court's orders denying class certification, which they timely exercised.' \n5  DISCUSSION \n6  I.  Standard ofR  eview \n7  We review the District Court's denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. \n8  Robinson v, Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 16:2 (2d Cir. 2001).  However, we \n9  \"review de novo the district court's conclusions of law that informed its decision to deny class \n10  certification.\" Parker v. Time Warner Entm 't Co., 331 F.3d 13, 18 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation \nII  marks omitted).  Further, we are \"noticeably less deferential when the district court has denied \n12  class status than when it has certified a class.\" !d. (quotation marks omitted and alterations \n13  incorporated); Robinson, 267 F.3d at 162.  We note that while the application of the incorrect \n14  legal principle often necessitates reversal under the \"abuse of discretion\" standard, such reversal \n15  need not indicate any \"abuse\" by the District Court as that word is commonly understood.  See \n16  Zervos v. Verizon NY, Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 168-69 & nn.4-6 (2d Cir. 2001) (distinguishing \n17  among various meanings of \"abuse of discretion\"). \n18  II.  The Requirements and Purpose ofR  ule 23(b)(3) \n19 \n20  In order to achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (l) satisfy \n21  the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are numerosity, typicality, commonality, and \n2A  lthough these plaintiffs have se:~led their individual claims, they have reserved their \nright, in the event of a class settlement, to \"seek or receive additional compensation for attorney's \nfees and [their] time and effort as ... class representative[s).\" \n9 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 10 of 21\nadequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate that common \"questions oflaw or fact\" predominate \n2  over \"any questions affecting only individual members\"; and (3) establish that the class action \n3  mechanism is \"superior to other available methods for the fuir and efficient adjudication of the \n4  controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(bX3). \n5  As a general matter, the \"Rule 23(bX  3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed \n6  classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by represeritation.\" in re Visa \n7  Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks \n8  omitted).  The Rule \"encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies \n9  of time, effort, and expense, and promote' uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, \nI 0  without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\" Fed. R. Civ. \nII  P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. \n12  In light of these purposes, we have set forth that although \"a defense may arise and may \n13  affect different class members diffurently, [this occurrence] does not compel a finding that \n14  individual issues predominate over common ones.\" in re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at !38 (internal \n15  quotation marks omitted).  So \"long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class \n16  members together, variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically \n17  foreclose class certification.\" id.

The District Court Erred in Failing to CertifY a Class on the Issue ofL iability \n19  Pursuant to Rules 13(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) \n20  As set forth more fully below, we conclude that the District Court erred by failing to \n21  certify a class on the issue of liability.'  We first conclude that, contrary to the District Court's \n'We reach this conclusion without considering whether the District Court should have \ncertified a class as to plaintiffs' entire claims-an issue that, as set forth more fully below, we \n10 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 11 of 21\nI  reservations, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certifY a class on a particular issue even if \n2  the action as a whole does not satisfY Rute 23(b )(3)'s predominance requirement.  Second, we \n3  hold that the District Court committed legal error in concluding that defendants' concession \n4  eliminated common liability issues from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis.  Third, this \n5  error caused the District Court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that \n6  individualized liability issues predominated over common ones, and that the class action \n7  mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle under these circumst<mces. \n8  A.  A District Court May Certify a Class as to Specific Issues Regardless of \n9  Whether the Entire Claim Satisfies Rule 13(b)(3) \n10 \nII  Whether a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certifY a class as to a specific issue \n12  where the entire claim does not satisfY Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is a matter of \n13  first impression in this Circuit.  See Robinson, 267 F.3d at 167 n.l2 (identifYing question as one \n14  of first impression and declining to resolve it). It also is a matter as to which the Circuits have \n15  split. Id. \n16  The Fiflh Circuit has adopted a \"strict application\" of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance \n17  requirement. ld.  Under this view, \"[t]he proper interpretation of the interaction between \n18  subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must satisfY the predominance \n19  requirement of (b ){3) and that ( c )(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the \n20  common issues for a class trial.\" Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745 n.21 (5th Cir. \n21  1996). \n22  The Ninth Circuit holds a different view.  Pursuant to that court's precedent, \"(e]ven if \nask the District Court to revisit in light of our holdings. \n11 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 12 of 21\n1  the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification \n2  of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to \n3  isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these \n4  particular issues.\"  Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 19%); cf \n5  Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs .. Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding that courts may \n6  employ Rule 23(c) to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs' claims, taken \n7  together, do not satisfy the predominance requirement). \n8  We agree with the Ninth Circuit's view of the matter.  First, the plain language and \n9  structure of Rule 23 support the Ninth Circuit's view.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides as follows: \n10  When appropriate (A) an action maybe brought or maintained as a \n11  class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be \n12  divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the \n13  provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied \n14  accordingly. \n15  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (emphases added). \n16  As the rule's plain language and structure establish, a court must frrst identify the issues \n17  potentially appropriate for certification \"and ... then\" apply the other provisions of the rule, i.e., \n18  subsection (b)(3) and its predominance analysis.  See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439 (reasoning that \n19  the rule's language provides this \"express command\" that \"courts have no discretion to ignore\"). \n20  Second, the Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understanding.  With respect to \n21  subsection (c)(4), the notes set forth that, \"[f]or example, in a fraud or similar case the action \n22  may retain its 'class' character only through the adjudication ofliability to the class; the members \n23  of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their \n24  respective claims.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c){4) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. (emphasis added). \n12 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 13 of 21\nAs the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4) when it is the \"only'' way that a \n2  litigation retains its class character, i.e., when common questions predominate only as to the \n3  \"particular issues\" of which the provision speaks.  Further, the notes illustrate that a court may \n4  properly employ this technique to separate the issue of liability from damages. \n5  In addition, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, the Fifth Circuit's view renders subsection \n6  (c)(4) virtually null, which contravenes the \"well-settled\" principle \"that courts should avoid \n7  statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous.\" State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. \n8  Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003).  Pursuant to the Fifth Circuit's view, \"a court \n9  considering the manageability of a class action-a requirement fur predominance under Rule \n10  23(b )(3)(D)- [would have) to pretend that subsection (c)(4 ) - a provision specifically included \nII  to make a class action more manageable ยท-does not exist until after the manageability \n12  determination [has been] made.\"  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439.  Accordingly, \"a court could only \n13  use subsection (c)(4) to manage cases that the court had already determined would be \n14  manageable without consideration of subsection (c)(4 ).\" I d. \n15  Finally, we note that the commentators agree that courts may use subsection (c)(4) to \n16  single out issues for class treatment when the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). \n17  See 7A  A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 1790 (3d ed. 2005) (stating that \n18  subsection (c)(4) \"best may be used to designate appropriate classes or class issues at the \n19  certification stage\" so that \"the court can determine whether, as so designated, the other Rule 23 \n20  requirements are satisfied\"); 6 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions ยง \n21  18:7 (4th ed. 2002) (\"Even cases which might not satisfy the predominance test when the case is \n22  viewed as a whole may sometimes be certified as a class limited to selected issues that are \n13 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 14 of 21\nI  common, under the authority ofRule 23(c)(4).\"). \n2  For those reasons, we hold that a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as \n3  to liability regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance \n4  requirement. \n5  B.  The District Court Erred When It Concluded that Defendants' Concession \n6  Eliminates Common Liability Issues from Rule 23(b)(3) 's Predominance \n7  Analysis \n8 \n9  As noted above, the District Court reasoned that the major liability issues common to the \nI 0  class - whether defendants implemented a blanket strip search policy, and if so, whether they are \n11  liable for it -were eliminated from the predominance analysis by defendants' concession. \n12  Whether a concession can limit the predominance analysis in that fashion also is a question of \n13  first impression.  For three reasons, we conclude that a concession does not eliminate a common \n14  issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District Court erred in holding otherwise. \n15  First, because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a '\"sufficiently \n16  cohesive\"' unit, In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136, all factual or legal issues that are common to \n17  the class inform the analysis.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621 (1997) \n18  (\"Subdivisions (a) and (b) focus court attโข~ntion on whether a pmposed class has sufficient unity \n19  so that absent members can fairly be bmmd by decisions of class representatives.\").  In tum, an \n20  issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof. In re Visa \n21  Check, 280 F.3d at 136 (\"In order to meet the predominance requirement ... a plaintiff must \n22  establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus \n23  applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to \n14 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 15 of 21\nindividualized proof.\" (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration incorporated)); see also \n2  Heerwagen v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, 435 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that \"a \n3  plaintiff must show that those issues ... subject to generalized proof outweigh those issues that \n4  are subject to individualized proof); Moore v. Paine Webber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir. \n5  2002) (same).  That the class-wide proof comes in the form of a simple concession rather than \n6  contested evidence certainly shortens the time that the court must spend adjudicating the issue, \n7  but it does nothing to alter the fundamental cohesion of the proposed class, which is the central \n8  concern of the predominance requirement.  See 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg \n9  on Class Actions ยง 4:25 (4th ed. 2002) {\"[T]he predominance test does not involve a comparison \n10  of court time needed to adjudicate common issues weighed against time needed to dispose of \n11  individual issues ....\" ); 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedureยง 1778 (3d ed. \n12  2005) (\"[C]lockwatching is not very helpful in ascertaining whether class-action treatment would \n13  be desirable in a particular case.\").  Similarly, the fact that an issue is conceded or otherwise \n14  resolved does not mean that it ceases to be an \"issue\" for the purposes of predominance analysis. \n15  Even resolved questions continue to implicate the \"common nucleus of operative facts and \n16  issues\" with which the predominance inquiry is concerned. See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. \n17  Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he fact that an issue has been resolved on \n18  summary judgment does not remove it from the predominance calculus.\").  Just as much as do \n19  contested issues, resolved issues bear on the key question that the analysis seeks to answer: \n20  whether the class is a legally coherent unit of representation by which absent class members may \n21  fair! y be bound. \n22  Second, Rule 23 seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater \n15 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 16 of 21\nuniformity of decision as to similarly situated parties.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. \n2  to 1966 amend.  For these reasons we have written that when plaintiffs are \"allegedly aggrieved \n3  by a single policy of defendants,\" such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case presents \n4  \"precisely the type of situation for which the class action devioe is suited\" since many nearly \n5  identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146. \n6  Eliminating conceded issues from Rule 23(bX  3)' s predominance calculus would \n7  undermine the goal of efficiency by requiring plaintiffs who share a \"commonality of the \n8  violation and the harm,\" nonetheless to pursue separate and potentially numerous actions \n9  because, ironically, liability is so clear. ld. (noting that class action management \"problems pale \nI 0  in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually\"). \n11  Such a result also undermines the goal of uniformity by creating the risk of inconsistent decisions \n12  through the repeated litigation of the same question; here, for example, each individual plaintiff \n13  would have to establish anew that defendants were collaterally estopped by their prior concession \n14  and, if not, that defendants were liable on the merits.  Cf Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 208 F.3d \n15  at 299 (concluding that because certification was \"necessary to determine whether the prior \n16  resolution carries res judicata effect with respect to purported class members,\" the district court \n17  properly took account of\"the common nucleus of operative facts and issues, even though certain \n18  of these already had been resolved\").  Although defendants have conceded liability to these \n19  plaintiffs, there is no guarantee that they would concede liability in a ease or series of cases \n20  involving significantly higher damages.  Further, courts might differ as to whether, in light of the \n21  settlement, the requirements of collateral estoppel were met, specifically, whether the issue of \n22  liability was \"actually litigated and decided\" and whether its \"resolution ... was necessary to \n16 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 17 of 21\nsupport a valid and final judgment on the merits.\" Ball v. A.O. Smiih Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 (2d \n2  Cir. 2006); cf In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370, 387 n.15 (2d Cir. 2005) \n3  (\"[I)t is clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be \n4  forced to relitigate the same issues involved in the settled cases.\"); Marvel Characters, Inc. v. \n5  Simon, 310 F.3d 280,289 (2d Cir. 2002). \n6  Finally, we find further support for our view in the specific circumstances of this case. \n7  Defendants possess, but have not disclosed, records of all the newly-admitted misdemeanor \n8  detainees strip searched pursuant to the blanket policy.  Absent class certification and its \n9  attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these individuals - who potentially number in the \n10  thousands -likely never will know that defendants violated their clearly established \nII  constitutional rights, and thus never will he able to vindicate those rights.  As a prnctical matter, \n12  then, without use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by defendants' policy and \n13  practice may lack an effective remedy altogether.  Cf Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 \n14  U.S. 326, 339 (1980) (noting that in certain cases \"aggrieved persons may be without any \n15  effective redress unless they may employ the class-action device''); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 \n16  F.3d I, 7 (I st Cir. 2004) (\"[F]or most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the \n17  superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to \n18  establish liability and perhaps damages.\").  Further, if defendants may utilize their concession to \n19  defeat class certification, it would work the perverse result of allowing them to escape the cost of \n20  their unconstitutional behavior precisely because their liability is too plain to be denied.  No \n21  other court has sanctioned such a result; nor shall we. \n22  Accordingly, we hold that defendants' concession of liability does not eliminate that \n17 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 18 of 21\notherwise common issue from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis, and the District Court \n2  erred when it concluded to the contrary. \nc. \n3  The District Court Erred in Determining that, as to Liability, Individual Issues \n4  Predominated \n5 \n6  As we have established, the District Court was ( 1) free to certify a class on the issue of \n7  liability notwithstanding its conclusion that the action as a whole did not satisfy the \n8  predominance requirement and (2) required to consider conceded common liability issues in its \n9  predominance analysis.  We now apply these principles to the District Court's opinion and order \nI 0  dated September 23, 2003 in which it derJed certification on the issue of liability, as well as that \nII  dated November 7, 2003 in which it adhered to its September decisinn.  The class definition at \n12  issue was as follows: \"[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offunses in \n13  Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants' blanket \n14  policy, practice and custom which requin:d that all artestees be strip-searched upon admission to \n15  the facility ....\"   (alterations incorporated). \n16  As noted, that definition obviated the need for individualized proceedings to determine \n17  class membership.  The definition referenced only defendants' \"blanket policy,\" thus avoiding \n18  questions of probable cause and excluding individuals strip searched after the policy's cessation. \n19  Since defendants possess records of misdemeanor detainees strip searched during the policy \n20  period, determining class membership would be simple. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 142 \n21  (approving class certification where \"class members ... can be identified by defendants' own \n22  records\"}. \n23  The class definition also implicated two broad common liability issues: whether the \n18 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 19 of 21\nblanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for its implementation.  The only \n2  countervailing, individualized liability issue was whether, regardless of the policy, some \n3  plaintiffs were strip searched based upon \"reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.\" \n4  The existence of this defense does \"not ... foreclose class certification.\" Id. at 138 (internal \n5  quotation marks omitted).  Further, as the District Court recognized, \"any such 'reasonable \n6  suspicion inquiries' will be de minimis\"; indeed, defendants set forth that \"such an inquiry will \n7  only be sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs.\"  In light of the pervasive character of \n8  the common liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability \n9  issues, we conclude that the District Court erred by holding that individual liability issues \n10  predominated over common ones in its decisions dated September 23, 2003, and November 7, \n11  2003. \n12  D.  The District Court Erred in Concluding that the Class Action Device Is Not a \n13  Superior Litigation Mechanism \n14 \n15  For Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper, a class action also must be the most \"fair and \n16  efficient\" method of resolving this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In analyzing that question, \n17  courts must consider four nonexclusive factors: (I) the interest of the class members in \n18  maintaining separate actions; (2) \"the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the \n19  controversy already commenced by or against members of the class\"; (3) \"the desirability or \n20  undesirability of concentrating the litigation ofthe claims in the particular forum\"; and (4) \"the \n21  difficulties likely to he encountered in the management of a class action.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n22  23(b)(3).  Contrary to the District Court's conclusion in its decision dated November 7, 2003, all \n23  of these factors -as well as the reasons set forth above regarding efficiency and fairness - favor \n19 \n\nโข  Case 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 20 of 21\nI  class certification. \n2  First, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since there \n3  already exists a concession of liability in this action and, without class notification, most putative \n4  class members will not even know that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights. \nS  Second, this action already has progress<~d substantially and, again, offers the benefit of a liability \n6  phase that can be resolved quickly and conclusively. Third, concentrating the litigation in one \n7  forum simplifies and streamlines the litigation process.  Fourth, we perceive little difficulty in \n8  managing a class action on the issue of liability, especially since the District Court already has \n9  noted that any individualized inquiries will be few and fur between.  Accordingly, we conclude \n10  that the District Court erred in holding that a class action was not the most fair and efficient \n1 I  litigation vehicle under these circumstances. \n12  CONCLUSION \n13  We hold that (1) district courts may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a \n14  designated issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test; (2) \n15  conceded common issues remain part of the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court \n16  exceeded its allowable discretion in denying Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) class certification on the \n17  issue ofliability in its decisions dated September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003.' \n4Because we have found that certification as to liability is proper pursuant to Rnle \n23(b) (3), there is \"no necessity\" of addressing alternate grounds for certification, such as Rule \n23(b)(2), that the District Court rejected.  Cf. In re VIsa Check, 280 F.3d at 147 (declining to \nreview district court's ruling on Rule 23(b)(2) certification after concluding that Rule 23(b)(3) \ncertification was proper) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, since we base our decision \non the September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 orders, we need not consider the District \nCourt's August 20, 2004 order, in which it rejected a radically different class definition for \nfailure to satisfy Rule 23(a). \n20 \n\nโข \nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 21 of 21\nIn light of our direction to certifY a class on the issue of liability pursuant to the definition \n2  set forth in the September 23 decision, we also instruct the District Court to consider anew \n3  whether to certifY a class as to damages as well.  The District Court should bear in mind that \n4  \"[t]here are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any \n5  individualized damages issues,\" such as bifurcation, the use of a magistrate or special master, \n6  alteration of the class definition, the creation of subclasses, or even decertification after a finding \n7  of liability.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 141. \n8  In sum, we remand to the District Court with instructions to certifY a class as to liability \n9  and consider certifYing a damages class as well. \n21 ",

Further, even if the denial of class certification \nis reversed on appeal, none of these ten individual plaintiffs can increase his or \nher compensatory damages, nor receive any punitive damages, based on his or her \ninjuries, but rather may only seek or receive additional compensation for \nattorney's fees and his or her time and effort as a class representative, subj ect to \nthe limits specified in paragraphs 7 and 9 below; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 103      Filed 06/24/2005     Page 3 of 9\n(2)  all class claims, including attorneys' fees and costs, are expressly reserved and \npreserved; \n(3)  the individual plaintiffs expressly retain the right to appeal denial of class \ncertification on behalf of the putative class; \n(4)  each individual plaintiff (a) suffered an \"actual, concrete injury\" and (b) will \nretain a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of the appeal of the denial of class \ncertification, including but not limited to the sharing of attorneys' fees and costs \nwith the putative class and compensation for time and effort expended as a class \nrepresentative as specified in paragraph 7 below; \n(5)  defendants will not oppose the individual plaintiffs' appeal of denial of class \ncertification on grounds of lack of standing or mootness arising from the \nsettlement of these cases. Defendants retain the right to raise standing and/or \nmootness objections to the appeal of class certification with respect to those issues \nfor which the existence of these grounds lies without regard to settlement of these \ncases; \n(6)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, the individual plaintiffs' \nstanding in this action will relate back to the time in which class certification was \ninitially denied; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 103      Filed 06/24/2005     Page 4 of 9\n(7)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, defendants will not contest \nthe adequacy ofthe individual plaintiffs to continue to represent the certified class \nas class representatives on the basis that they have already settled their \ncompensatory and punitive damages claims.  Defendants retain the right to oppose \nany or all ofthe ten individual plaintiffs acting as a class representative on the \nbasis of the typicality of their experience as compared with the other members of \nthe certified class, should such a class come into existence.  Absent objections to \nthe appropriateness of any of the ten individual plaintiffs on the basis of their \ntypicality, defendants will not oppose plaintiffs' right to (a) offer their personal \ncircumstances in support of the class claims, (b) seek and receive any class wide \nequitable relief and any other appropriate relief on behalf of the certified class \nother than any increase in his or her individual compensatory damages, or receipt \nof any punitive damages, based on his or her injuries, and (c) apply for \ncompensation for their time and efforts as class representatives in an amount not \nto exceed $1,000 per class representative, with the express understanding that the \nindividual plaintiffs may not seek any further compensation for compensatory \ndamages, or share in any award of punitive damages awarded to the class; \n(8)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, defendants will not oppose \ngenerally the intervention of class members other than the named plaintiffs as \nadditional named class representatives, but defendants will retain the right to \ncontest the adequacy of any such individuals to serve as additional class \nrepresentatives under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 103      Filed 06/24/2005     Page 5 of 9\n(9)  if the denial of class certification is reversed and the class action case moves \nforward or is settled, plaintiffs, including the individual plaintiffs, will be \npermitted to apply for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs for the entire litigation \nfrom its inception as prevailing parties, and such fees and costs will not be \ncapped; \n(10)  if the denial of class certification is upheld on appeal, the individual plaintiffs will \nbe granted a reasonable time (not less than thirty (30) days from the issuance of \nthe mandate by the Second Circuit) to apply for reasonable attorneys' fees and \ncosts in an aggregate amount not to exceed $125,000; \n(II)  This Stipulation of Judgment is made subject to the approval of the Nassau \nCounty Legislature.  The Nassau County Legislature may, in its sole discretion, \nchoose to accept or reject this settlement on behalf of the County, or require a \nbond sale subject to its approval to effect payment Should this settlement and/or \nany required bond sale be rejected by the Legislature, defendants hereby agree to \nrestore the Actions to the calendar.  Defendants also agree to take all steps \nnecessary to present this Stipulation of Judgment to the Legislature in a timely and \nprompt manner; \n(12)  If denial of class certification is reversed, and the class action moves forward, the \nparties acknowledge that there will be additional discovery proceedings, and the \npre-trial Order may be amended to include additional evidence and witnesses, \n\nr1A'I-17-2005  10: 23  BELDOCK  LEV I NE  8.

Appโx. 746 (2d Cir. 2016).\n2\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 3 of 18 PageID #: 5240\nfederal and state social services assistance programs and it has no authority to use WMS for any\nother purpose or to grant access to any unauthorized third party, including plaintiffs and to do so\nwould be a violation of federal and state law.โ Id. at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAffidavits from the Deputy Counsel to the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance\n(โOTDAโ), the Deputy Assistant Counsel with the New York State Office of Children and\nFamily Services (successor to the New York State Department of Social Services) and the\nDirector of the Bureau of Health Insurance Programs within the Division of Legal Affairs of the\nNew York State Department of Health were submitted in support of the Countyโs position.\nNeither New York State nor any of the cited agencies sought to intervene in this matter. After\nconsidering the positions of the parties, the Court directed the County in the April Order to โrun\nthe names of said class members [i.e. those who had not yet filed claims] and their contact\ninformation through WMS for updated addresses and provide to the Claims Administrator any\nupdated addresses garnered from WMS and from [Nassau County Corrections Center] records at\nthe same time.โ No deadline for compliance was set.\nThereafter, the Court received an application from the County for a conference. \nAccording to that application, a copy of the April Order was sent to both the Countyโs\nDepartment of Social Services and the Deputy General Counsel for the OTDA, which agencies\nwere advised that the County would be complying with the Order. โIn response, the State raised a\nnumber of questions regarding the manner in which the search was conducted and noted various\nobjections.โ DE 519 at 2. Despite several communications and conversations, the State has โyet\nto withdraw their objectionsโ and rejected a suggestion that โthe State social services agencies\n3\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 4 of 18 PageID #: 5241\nconduct the requisite search to satisfy any concerns about the methodology of the search, or in\nthe alternative, that they intervene in this action and address their concerns about the breadth of\nthe Courtโs Orderโ โon the basis that State is not a party to this action.โ Id.  In addition, an e-mail\nfrom the USDA Food & Nutrition Service which states that its โNational Office has determined\nthat Nassau County Social Services cannot legally release this PII [personal identification\ninformation] of SNAP recipientsโ was forwarded to the County; an โoffer to re-run the records\nsearch without any SNAP informationโ was โrejected by the State.โ Id.  In an Order dated May 2,\n2017 (the โMay Orderโ), the Court denied the request for a conference โ[a]s neither New York\nState nor the USDA is before this Court, the Court cannot compel their attendance.โ May Order\nat 2-3.  The Court went on to state that โ[s]hould either New York State or the USDA wish to be\nheard on this matter, the appropriate course would be for them to move to intervene in the action,\nwhich motion, if made, should include the nature of their interest, as well as their specific\nobjections, and concomitant legal arguments, to the April Order.โ The present motions followed.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Applicable Standard  -  Motion to Intervene\nIntervention in a civil action is governed by Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Intervention as of right is appropriate when the party seeking to intervene โclaims an\ninterest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated\nthat disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movantโs ability to\nprotect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.โ Fed. R. Civ. P.\n24(a). Permissive intervention by a government agency or officer may be permitted โif a partyโs\n4\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 5 of 18 PageID #: 5242\nclaim or defense is based on . . . any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made\nunder [a] statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency.โ Fed. R. Civ. P.\n24(b)(B). The party seeking to intervene โbears the burden of demonstrating that it meets all the\nrequirements for intervention.โ Mehedi v. Memry Corp., 2017 WL 2873224, * 4 (D. Conn. July\n5, 2017). โIn considering a motion to intervene, the court must accept as true the non-conclusory\nallegations of the motion . . . .โ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nII. The Motions to Intervene Are Granted\nHere, both the USA Intervenors and the State Intervenors claim an interest in the property\nat issue in the present dispute - the WMS database - by virtue of statutes and regulations\ngoverning the disclosure of the information relating to various social service assistance programs\ncontained on that database.3   Specifically, the USA Intervenors assert that โUSDA and HHS\nhave an interest in the property at issue, viz. the PII contained in the WMS database that\nCongress, by statute has required that they protect.โ DE 533-1 at p. 6 (citing 7 U.S.C. ยง\n2020(e)(8)(A)-(D); 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(7)(A); 7 C.F.R. 272.1, 42 C.F.R. 431.301). Thus, it\nasserts that it is entitled to intervene as of right.  However, proposed intervenors do not address\nwhether Nassau County, as an existing party, adequately represents that interest, a required part\nof the intervention as of right analysis. The Court need not address the issue because, as\ndiscussed below, it finds permissive intervention is proper. \nHere, Nassau County opposed release of the PII on the WMS database as violative of \n3 State Intervenors describe WMS as the โNew York State database for โreceiving,\nmaintaining and processing information relating to persons who have applied for or been\ndetermined eligible for benefitsโ under public assistance and care programs and SNAP.โ State\nIntervenors Mem. at 3 (citing N.Y.

These programs are administered by the proposed intervenors.\nPermissive intervention by the Federal and State Intervenors is therefore appropriate and said\nportions of the present motions are granted. \nThe Court will now address that portion of the Intervenorsโ motions which address the\npropriety of the disclosure ordered in the Courtโs April Order, beginning with the USA\nIntervenorsโ arguments.\nIII. Disclosure Under the Federal Statutes \nThe WMS database contains information relating to two federal programs - the\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (โSNAPโ), which is overseen by the USDA, and\nMedicaid, which is overseen by HHS.\nA. SNAP  \nSNAP provides eligible households with an allotment to purchase food pursuant to the\nFood and Nutrition Assistance Act (โFNAโ). 7 U.S.C. ยง 2013(a). States that participate in SNAP\nmust provide a plan of operation for approval to an agency of the USDA and are required to\nadminister the program in compliance with the FNA and regulations promulgated thereunder. 7\nU.S.C. 2020(a)(3), (d), (e); 7 C.F.R. 272.2(a)-(d). \nUnder the FNA, a state plan of operation โshall provide,โ among other things:\nsafeguards which prohibit the use or disclosure of information\nobtained from applicant households, except that--\n(A) the safeguards shall permitโ\n(i) the disclosure of such information to persons directly\nconnected with the administration or enforcement of the\n6\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 7 of 18 PageID #: 5244\nprovisions of this chapter, regulations issued pursuant to\nthis chapter, Federal assistance programs, or\nfederally-assisted State programs;

Medicare\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act provides grants to states for medical assistance\nprograms for categorically needy persons. State plans for such programs are required to provide\nโsafeguards which restrict the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants and\nrecipients to purposes directly connected with (i) the administration of the plan; and (ii) the\n9\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 10 of 18 PageID #: 5247\nexchange of information necessary to certify or verify the eligibility of children for free or\nreduced priceโ meals. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(A)(7). Medicare regulations require states to\nโsafeguard[]โ the names and addresses of applicants and beneficiaries, as well as other\nenumerated types of information. 42 C.F.R. ยง 431.305. Moreover, the state โmust have criteria\nspecifying the conditions for release and use of information about applicants and beneficiaries.โ \n42 C.F.R. ยง 431.306(a). These โpolicies must apply to all requests for information from outside\nsources, including governmental bodies, the courts or law enforcement officials.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง\n431.306(e). And โ[i]f a court issues a subpoena for a case record . . . the agency must inform the\ncourt of the applicable statutory provisions, policies, and regulations restricting disclosure of\ninformation.โ  42 C.F.R. ยง 431.306(f).\nC. Federal Intervenorsโ Argument\nIn urging this Court to vacate its April Order, Federal Intervenors argue that the statues\nand regulations governing Medicare and SNAP provide for limited disclosure of the PII of\napplicants for and beneficiaries of these programs and the disclosure ordered by this Court does\nnot fall within the parameters of that limited disclosure.   \nD. Discussion\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow for โdiscovery regarding any nonprivileged\nmatter that is relevant to a partyโs claims or defensesโ as well as โ[i]n aid of [a] judgment.โ Fed.\nR. Civ. Pro. 26(b)(1) and 69(a)(2). \nThe statutes and regulations relied upon by the Federal Intervenors provide for the\nconfidentiality of  PII of applicants and beneficiaries. But the designation of information as\n10\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 11 of 18 PageID #: 5248\nconfidential does not necessarily prohibit its disclosure. See Assoc. for Women in Science v.\nCalifano, 566 F.2d 339, 343-344 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Accord Zambrano v. I.N.S., 972 F.2d 1122,\n1125 (9th Cir. 1992), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 113 S. Ct. 3028 (1993); Steinberg\nv. Mount Sinai Med. Ctr., Inc., 2014 WL 1311572 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014); In re Zyprexa\nProds. Liab.

Prac. & Proc. Evid. ยง 5437 (1st ed.) (noting that the bulk of\nfederal statutes do no more than forbid disclosure; privilege from disclosure โcan be inferred\nfrom language that makes the information immune from process or providing that a person\ncannot be compelled to reveal itโ).  \nThere is no doubt here that the information sought is relevant to the execution of the relief\nawarded in the judgment. Given the statutorily based confidentiality provisions and the\naforementioned Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it appears that the appropriate analysis is\nwhether the information Plaintiffs seek is protected from disclosure by privilege. See, e.g., Assoc.\nfor Women in Science, 566 F.2d at 344; Steinberg, 2014 WL 1311572,  at *3. See generally\nBaldrige v. Shapiro, 455 U.S. 345, 360 (1982) (โIf a privilege exists, information may be\nwithheld, even if relevant to the lawsuit and essential to the establishment of plaintiffโs claim.โ).\nโIt is well recognized that a privilege may be created by statute. A statute granting a\nprivilege is to be strictly construed so as to โavoid construction that would suppress otherwise\ncompetent evidence.โโ Baldrige, 455 U.S. at 360 (quoting St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States,\n368 U.S. 208, 218 (1961)); accord Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 234 F.R.D.\n11\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 12 of 18 PageID #: 5249\n7, 11 (D.D.C. 2006) (โ[I]t is well established that courts are to avoid construing confidentiality\nprovisions in statutes as barring disclosure for discovery purposes unless the statute clearly and\nunambiguously requires such suppression.โ).  Courts have observed that โwhen Congress has\nintended [information] not to be subject to compulsory process it has said so.โ St. Regis Paper,\n368 U.S. at 218; see also Friedman v. Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., 738 F.2d 1336, 1343\n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (โCongress must โclearlyโ and โstronglyโ indicate its intent to contradict th[e]\nbroad objective favoring disclosure in judicial proceedings,โ and โwhere Congress has thought it\nnecessary to protect against court use of records, it has expressly so provided by specific\nlanguage.โ); Freeman v. Seligson, 405 F.2d 1326, 1348โ52 (D.C. Cir. 1968). Thus, certain\nstatutes expressly provide, for example, that various information is โimmune from legal processโ\nand/or โshall not be subject to discovery.โ  See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. ยง 2055(e)(2) (2000) (certain\nconsumer product safety reports โshall be immune from legal process and shall not be subject to\nsubpoena or other discovery in any civil action in a State or Federal court or in any administrative\nproceedingโ); 20 U.S.C. ยง 9573(d)(1)(B) (2000) (โIndividually identifiable information . . . shall\nbe immune from legal process and shall not, without the consent of the individual concerned, be\nadmitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial or\nadministrative proceedingโ); 22 U.S.C. ยง 3144(d) (2000) (foreign investment information โshall\nbe immune from legal process and shall not be used as evidence or for any purpose in any\nFederal, State, or local government action, suit, or other administrative or judicial proceeding\nexcept as necessary to enforce . . . the provisions of . . . this section.โ); 23 U.S.C. ยง 409 (2000)\n(certain highway safety data โshall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a\n12\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 13 of 18 PageID #: 5250\nFederal or State court proceeding or considered for other purposes in any action for damagesโ);\n42 U.S.C. ยง 3789g(a) (2000) (certain information collected of the Office of Justice Programs\nโshall be immune from legal process, and shall not, without the consent of the person furnishing\nsuch information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other\njudicial, legislative, or administrative proceedingsโ).   \nUnlike the foregoing statutes, neither the statutes or regulations relied upon by Federal\nIntervenors specifically provides that information is not subject to discovery. Indeed, while the\nMedicaid regulations provide that a stateโs policies regarding disclosure must apply to courts, it\ndoes not require that the information be shielded from disclosure. Rather, it simply requires that\nthe agency โinform the court of the applicable statutory provisions, policies, and regulations\nrestricting disclosure of information.โ \nUSA Intervenors do not address the issue of privilege. Rather they argue that โCourts\nanalyzing the federal statutes and regulations governing SNAP and Medicaid have authorized\ndisclosure only in the most limited of  circumstances.โ USA Intervenors Mem. at 9.  In support of\nthat proposition they cite a number of cases. These cases suggest, however, that disclosure\noutside the parameters enumerated in the statutes is permissible, in other words that the\ninformation is not privileged.4  For example, in Hassan v. United States, 2006 WL 681038 (W.D.\nWash. Mar. 15, 2006) merchants challenging their disqualification under the Food Stamp Act for\nallegedly unlawful food stamp trafficking sought disclosure of the identities of individuals who\n4 Roberts v. Austin, 632 F.2d 1202, 1214 (5th Cir. 1980), cited by USA Intervenors, is\ndistinguishable.  That court granted a preliminary injunction barring wholesale disclosure of PII\nof Food Stamp recipients to a prosecutor where the prosecutor had no basis to suspect fraud.\n13\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 14 of 18 PageID #: 5251\nallegedly trafficked with them.  The Hassan court granted a motion to compel, specifically\nrejecting the argument that the confidentiality provisions of the Food Stamp Act5 prohibited the\ndisclosure. Id. at *2-3. See also In re Zyprexa, 254 F.R.D. at 78, 88-89 (ordering disclosure of \nde-identified medical records of Medicaid patients prescribed the drug at issue in litigation\nseeking damages for unlawful marketing);6 Protection & Advocacy System, Inc. v.

Pa. 1990) (applying a balancing test in denying a motion by the Government to\nenforce a subpoena seeking PII of Food Stamp recipients as part of an investigation of a heroin\nand cocaine distribution ring).\nIn sum, Federal Intervenors provide no basis for vacatur of the Courtโs April Order.\nIV. Disclosure Under State Statutes\nState Intervenors rely upon a number of statutes and regulations regarding the\nconfidentiality of information in the WMS database in addition to those previously discussed.\nState Intervenors Mem. at 3-9. It is not necessary to detail each of them, it is sufficient to state\nthat they provide for the confidentiality of the information of persons applying for benefits and\nlimit to whom the information may be disclosed. See, e.g., SSL ยงยง 21(3), 136(2), 459-b, 459-c;\n5 Until 2008, the FNA was known as the Food Stamp Act.\n6 Interestingly, the Zyprexa court noted that the โNotices of Privacy Practices issued by all\nthe Statesโ [involved in that litigation] make clear that health information obtained by the\nagencies may be disclosed pursuant to court order.โ 254 F.R.D. at 58 & n.11 (citing said privacy\nnotices). \n14\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 15 of 18 PageID #: 5252\n42 U.S.C. ยง 602(a)(1)(A)(iv) (requiring that states, such as New York, that receive funds for\ncertain public assistance restrict the use and disclosure of information). \nWith respect to the federal statutes relied upon, as previously discussed those statutes do\nnot protect against court use of records and courts have ordered disclosure outside the parameters\nenumerated in the statutes and regulations. That conclusion applies equally to SSL ยงยง 21 and\n136. As the State Intervenors note, โNew York federal and state courts have in several instances\nordered the disclosure of public assistance data for litigation purposes notwithstanding the\nconfidentiality provision of SSL ยงยง 21 and 136.โ State Intervenorsโ Mem at 15. They argue,\nhowever, that the proposed disclosure โis distinguishable from these precedents in at least three\nrespects (a) the search here is far broader, attempting to obtain the personal information of\nthousands of people across data compiled from every public benefit program; (b) there is no\ncolorable connection at all to a public benefit program; and (c) several categories of information\nin the WMS are governed by other confidentiality provisions of federal and state law aside from\nSSL ยงยง 21 and 136.โ Id. It is to these arguments that the Court now turns.\nThat the search here encompasses information of a large number of individuals does not\npreclude disclosure. For example, in Zyprexa, disclosure of  a โstatistically significant samplingโ\nof de-identified medical records maintained by five state (Connecticut, Louisiana, Mississippi,\nMontana and New Mexico) for Medicaid patients who were prescribed the drug at issue was\nordered. 254 F.R.D. at 59.  The decision does not disclose the volume of records at issue.\nHowever, other filings in that case indicate that a statistically significant sampling of just one\nstate would be 4,000. See In re Zyprexa Prod. Liab. Litig., 04-MD-1596 at DE 1937 (Aff. from\n15\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 16 of 18 PageID #: 5253\nNew Mexico Official referring to a statistically significant sampling from that state as involving\nthe records of 4,000 individuals). \nMoreover, there are numerous state court cases, some of which are cited in the April\nOrder, in which disclosure was ordered despite the fact that the request was made in a case\nuntethered to any public benefit program. See, e.g., Zaccaro v. 50 E. 196th Assocs., 1997 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23 1997) (granting motion to compel disclosure of social services\nfiles for claimant in action for damages due to injuries sustained as a result of infant claimantโs\ningestion of lead paint on premises on the theory the files might contain information relevant to\nan alternative causation defense); W. v. U., 44 A.D.2d 727 (2d Dept. 1974) (holding that putative\nfather in paternity action was entitled to subpoena welfare department to support his claim that\nmother had made inconsistent statements concerning parentage of children); In re Estate of\nRobinson, 140 Misc.2d 599 (1988) (in action by mother of decedent to compromise and settle\ncause of action for minor decedent, limited access granted to guardian ad litem appointed for\ndecedentโs father where guardian was not requesting information concerning income or benefits\nof recipient but only information relevant to the identity of his ward as demand for identify of\nunknown father necessitated minimal intrusion onto confidentiality of records so that guardian\ncould perform his function): Paine v. Chick, 50 A.D.2d 686 (3d Dept. 1975) (in action for\ndamages for personal injury and lost wages lower court properly denied motion to quash a\nsubpoena served on Commissioner of Social Security as it did not jeopardize the real purpose\nand function of statute restricting disclosure and was justified as there were no other relevant \ndocuments available.) \n16\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 17 of 18 PageID #: 5254\nThe confidentiality provisions of the federal statutes relied on by State Intervenors have\nalready been addressed. They also point to SSL ยง 459-h(1) which makes confidential โ[t]he street\naddress of any residential program for victims of domestic violenceโ which they proffer\nโpreserves the ability of residential programs to provide security for victims of domestic violence\nwho may be at serious risk of physical and emotional harm by their partners.โ State Intervenorsโ\nMem. at 21.  Certainly, this provision and its purpose would, at the very least, warrant a carefully\nnuanced application of a balancing of interests. The Court has been advised, however, that none\nof the 5,088 class members for whom updated addresses were found in the WMS represent\nresidents of domestic violence shelters. See Ex. 1 to Pl.โs Opp. Mem. (email from Nassau County\nAttorney Bureau Chief stating there is no such data).\nIn sum, State Intervenors provide no basis for vacatur of the Courtโs April Order.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is important to reiterate that the purpose of the disclosure authorized by the April Order\nis solely to notify the as yet unheard from class members about the monetary relief to which they\nare entitled under the judgment in this case.  Moreover, that disclosure was limited to obtaining \nupdated addresses for such class members,7 nothing more. Neither plaintiffsโ counsel, the class\nadministrator, or even the Court will have access to the database or know from what social\nservice program or programs the addresses were garnered. The Court directs that the information\nis not to be used for any other purpose or otherwise disseminated. \n7 The time for exclusion from the class has long passed. Having failed to be excluded, the\nclass members whose information is sought are, in a sense, parties to this litigation. Thus the\nordered disclosure is not of information of strangers to this lawsuit.\n17\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH-GRB   Document 537   Filed 07/26/17   Page 18 of 18 PageID #: 5255\nThe motions to intervene are granted.

For the following reasons, the \nCourt grants Defendants' motion and denies Plaintiffs' motion. \nI.  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO \"CLARIFY\" THE PREVIOUS CONCESSION \nOF LIABILITY. \nTo render the circumstances of the instant cross-motions clear, the Court must \nprovide some procedural background to this case. All of the following facts are derived \nfrom the undisputed procedural background of the instant case. \nOn May 20, 1999, the first of these three consolidated putative class action cases, \nFrancis O'Day. et al. v. Nassau County. et al. (99-CV-2844), was initiated by filing a \ncomplaint. This complaint sought equitable relief and damages due to a strip search \npolicy utilized by the Nassau County Correctional Center (\"NCCC\"). As alleged in this \ncomplaint, NCCC's strip search policy was applied to all individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors and minor offenses, regardless of any specific factual circumstances. On \nJune 1, 1999, Judge Wexler, in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), \naff'd. in relevant part, 273 F.3d 56 (2001), held that \"[t]he policy of strip searching all \nmisdemeanor and minor offense arrestees remanded to the NCCC, without requiring any \nsuspicion that the remanded individual is concealing weapons or other contraband, \n-2-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 3 of 15\nviolates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" 53 F. Supp. 2d at 568. \nThe other two complaints relevant to the instant action were filed after Judge Wexler's \nruling. The Court now considers all of the complaints. \nThe amended complaint in Francis O'Day (99-CV-2844), was filed on August 24, \n1999. In that complaint, the named plaintiffs sought monetary and injunctive relief due to \n(1) Defendants' policy of strip searching all non-felony admits to the NCCC and also (2) \ndue to Defendants alleged policy of strip searching all persons who have posted bail, or \nwho have otherwise been deemed releasable by a court, and who are then strip searched \nagain upon their return from court. See O'Day Amended Complaint~ 2. The amended \ncomplaint also alleges a \"policy practice and custom\" of unconstitutionally delaying in \nreleasing individuals who have already posted bail or are otherwise deemed \"releasable.\" \nId. ~ 3. \nThe amended complaint in Gardy Augustin. et al.. v. Joseph Jablonsky. et al. (99-\nCV-3126), the second initiated of the consolidated actions, seeks money damages and \ninjunctive relief for Defendants' purported policy of searching non-felony-charged \nindividuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See Augustin Amended Complaint~~ 3, 8-\n21. This amended complaint does not allege causes of action for either searches at other \npoints during detention or for any delays in being released. \nFinally, the amended complaint filed in Iaffaldano v. The County ofNassau. et al. \n(99-CV-4238), seeks money damages and injunctive relief from Defendants' purported \n-3-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 4 of 15\npolicy of searching non-felony-charged individuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See \nIaffaldano Amended Complaint~~ 4-6. This amended complaint targets the routine strip \nsearches that were conducted upon and during admittance to the NCCC. See id. ~ 34. No \nclaims are made for delays in being released. \nAfter the Shain decision, the Court received a motion to consolidate all of the \nabove captioned cases and to certify a class. The class definition suggested by Plaintiffs at \nthat time embraced \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who \nhave been admitted to the [NCCC] and strip searched without particularized reasonable \nsuspicion.\" On March 8, 2001 the Court granted the motion for consolidation and denied \nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification. See Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99-CV-3126, \n2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. March 8, 2001) (\"March 8 Order\"). In that order the Court \nheld, inter alia, that the proffered class definition would cause individual issues to \nsubstantially predominate over all common issues, thereby rendering class certification \ninappropriate. The Court denied reconsideration in a May 23, 2001 Memorandum \nOpinion and Order (\"May 23 Order\"). Plaintiffs' subsequent interlocutory appeal was \ndenied by the Second Circuit. \nOn September 23, 2003, the Court addressed Plaintiffs renewed motion for class \ncertification (\"September 23 Order\"). In connection with that renewed motion, Plaintiffs \nrevised the definition of their putative class. This proposed class definition included \nall persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau \nCounty who thereafter were strip[- ]searched at the [NCCC] pursuant to \n-4-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 5 of 15\ndefendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all \narrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility .... [This \ndefinition shall not] include individuals who were strip[-]searched after \nJudge Wexler's June 1, 1999[,] decision in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d \n564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), affd., 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 123 \nS.Ct. 672 (December 9, 2002) .... \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 2. \nHowever, because Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' motion contained certain \nnotable language, the Court did not reach that class definition. The relevant language \nstated: \n[D]efendants concede the existence of the one common issue that might be \nappropriate for class certification ... -namely, whether the [NCCC]'s strip \nsearch policy during the class period was constitutional. However, in Shain, \n... the Second Circuit held that the NCCC's policy of strip searching \npersons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to the facility in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion that they were carrying weapons or \ncontraband was unconstitutional. Defendants are bound by Shain under the \ndoctrine of collateral estoppel .... Given that the constitutionality of \nNCCC's strip search policy has now been resolved, there is no need to \ncertify a class with respect to that issue. \nDefendants' Opp. Mem. at 8 (citations and footnotes removed) \nThe Court read this language \"as a concession ofliability as to the named Plaintiffs \n(and, presumably, as to all others similarly situated) except to the extent that some \ncorrections officers may have searched some plaintiffs based upon a reasonable and \ncontemporaneously held suspicion rather than pursuant to the blanket strip search policy \nthen in effect.\" September 23 Order at 5-6 (footnote omitted). However, the Court gave \nDefendants the opportunity to retract or modify this concession. See id. at 6 n. 2. Despite \nthis clear and unambiguous opportunity, Defendants did not withdraw or otherwise \n-5-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 6 of 15\nmodify the concession. In fact, they later reaffirmed their concession. On the basis of this \nconcession, the Court found that there were no remaining common disputed issues of fact \nor law and held that class certification would be inappropriate. The Court later reaffirmed \nthis holding despite Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. See October 27, 2003, Order. \nThe circumstances have since changed. Defendants have since referred the instant \ncase away from their previous counsel; presumably preferring representation by the in \nhouse Nassau County Attorney's Office. This new counsel now seeks to \"clarify the \nprevious concession ofliability.\" At first blush, it appeared to the Court that Defendants \nsought to retroactively alter the basis for the Court's substantive orders in this case. For \nthis reason, in a conference connected with this request to clarify, the Court indicated that \nDefendants may need to explain why the principle of judicial estoppel would not apply. \nSee United States v. Hussein, 178 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir. 1999). Subsequently, the Court \nissued an order directing Defendants to make a formal motion to clarify the prior \nconcession. One of the issues that the Court directed Defendants to address in their \nmotion was the aforementioned doctrine of judicial estoppel. Upon review of Defendants' \nclarified concession, which the Court does not consider inconsistent with the prior \nconcession, and the absence of any prejudice to Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that the \nmotion should be granted. \nThe Court has carefully read Defendants' motion. As set out therein, Defendants' new \nconcession only applies to the blanket strip searches of all non-felony \"new admits\" to the \n-6-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 7 of 15\nNCCC. Defendant do not concede liability as to any other alleged strip search policy. As an \ninitial matter, the Court fails to see how this concession is different than the one that was \nmade in connection with the September 23 Order. The instant concession applies solely to \nthe blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC while the \nconcession made in connection with the September 23 Order conceded liability in connection \nwith Shain. Since, as discussed supra, Shain concerned the constitutionality of the policy \nrequiring strip searches of all non-felony admitees to NCCC, the Court cannot divine any \nsubstantive difference between the two concessions.1 Since such a difference is a necessary \nelement for the invocation ofj udicial estoppel, the Court concludes that this doctrine should \nnot prevent Defendants from the asserting the concession articulated in the context of the \ninstant motion. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that it cannot ascertain any prejudice to Plaintiffs \nflowing from this clarified concession. Indeed, although Plaintiffs express exasperation with \nthe \"clarification,\" they do not actively oppose Defendants' motion. Therefore, in light of the \nobservation that the two concessions are substantively identical and the lack ofp rejudice, the \nCourt accepts Defendants' clarified concession ofliability. For the purposes of clarity, the \nCourt will set forth this concession as follows: the County's amended concession ofliability \napplies solely to the blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC; \n1Due to this absence of any substantive difference, the Court cannot ascertain why \nDefendants felt obligated to clarify their concession, thereby necessitating the instant cross \nmotions. However, whatever the reasons, Defendants have endeavored to clarify their position. \n-7-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 8 of 15\nit does not cover the alleged strip search policy covering all persons who have posted bail or \nhave otherwise been deemed releasable, which is the subject of certain claims by some, \nalthough not all, of the named plaintiffs in this consolidated case, see Amended Complaint, \nFrancis O'Day (99-CV-2844). \nII.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. \nIn response to Defendants' application to change their concession, Plaintiffs now \nrenew their motion for class certification with a new proposed class definition. To certify a \nclass  pursuant  to  Rule  23,  the  putative  class  members  must  first  establish  that  the \nprerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been met and then establish that the action qualifies for \ncertification in accordance with Rule 23(b )(1 ), Rule 23(b )(2) or Rule 23(b )(3). See In re Visa \nCheck/MasterMoneyAntitrustLitigation, 280 F.3d 124,  132-133  (2d Cir.  2001).  This \nrequires a rigorous analysis at each step.  See Selby v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 197 \nF.R.D. 48, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). The Court now considers the proposed class definition in \nlight of these standards. \nA.  Plaintiffs' Proposed Class Definition. \nPlaintiffs allege a new class definition. This proposed class definition includes \"all \npersons who have or will be arrested for non-felony offenses and admitted to the NCCC.\" \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 5. Plaintiffs indicate thatthis definition embraces all individuals that were \n-8-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 9 of 15\narrested between May 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing \nDefendants to cease their policy. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should certify five \noverlapping subclasses. As presented, the Court is unwilling to accept this definition. \nB.  Rule 23(a). \nUnder Rule 23(a), there are four prerequisites to certification of a class: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) \nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). As currently framed, Plaintiffs' class definition fails to satisfy three of \nthe four prerequisites for class certification. \nAs an initial matter it is clear that the first prerequisite, sometimes referred to as \n\"numerosity,\" is  satisfied  by Plaintiffs'  proposed  class  definition.  Defendants  do  not \nmeaningfully argue that the individuals embraced by the instant proposed class definition fail \nto satisfy the numerosity requirement. Thus, joinder of the individuals embraced by the \nsuggested class definition would indeed be impracticable. The other three prerequisites to \nclass certification, however, are not satisfied by this definition. \nOn the face of the proposed class definition, no questions oflaw or fact are common \nor typical to all members of the class. These requirements are considered together because \n[t  ]he commonality and typicality requirements tend to merge into one another, \nso that similar considerations animate analysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3). The \ncrux of both requirements is to ensure that \"maintenance of a class action is \n-9-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 10 of 15\neconomical and [that] the named plaintiffs claim and the class claims are so \ninterrelated that the interests oft he class members will be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.\" \nMarisol A. by Forbes v.  Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir.  1997) (citations omitted) \n(quoting General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982)). \nTo satisfy the commonality requirement, Plaintiffs must establish that their claims \nshare a common question oflaw or fact. See In reAgent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d \n145, 166-167 (2d Cir. 1987). The class, as defined, does not share such an issue. This lack \nof commonality springs from the extremely broad character of the proposed class definition. \nThis is best highlighted by comparing Plaintiffs' proposed subdefinitions. See Plaintiffs' \nMem. at 5. By way of illustration the first four subdefinitions involve strip search policies \nat NCCC while the fifth  subdefinition merely embraces those who, under the specific \ncircumstances of each of their individual cases, were delayed in their release from NCCC \nafter being deemed \"releasable.\" As framed, there is no adequate degree of factual or legal \ncommonality among these subdefinitions, all of which are embraced by the larger proposed \nclass definition. Next, the Court notes that the June I, 1999, cessation of the new admits \npolicy that resulted in strip searches for the named Plaintiffs obviates any commonality with \nindividuals who were later searched. Thus, as framed, the only commonality lies in the fact \nthat  all  members  were  arrested  for  non-felony  crimes.  However,  this  common,  and \nundisputed, arrest history does not set forth an adequate common issue of law or fact. \nA class representative's claims are \"typical\" under Rule 23(a)(3), where each class \nmember's claims arise from the same course of events and each class member makes similar \n-10-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 11 of 15\nlegal arguments to prove defendants' liability. See Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. \nCo., 267 F.3d 147,  155  (2d Cir. 2001). \"While it is settled that the mere existence of \nindividualized factual questions with respect to the class representative's claim will not bar \nclass certification, class certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative \nis subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.\" Gary \nPlastic Packaging Com. v. Merrill Lynch. Pierce. Fenner & Smith. Inc., 903 F.2d 176, 180 \n(2d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). The individualized fact questions relevant to the instant \ncase have been thoroughly discussed in previous orders. The Court will not address those \nissues again in the context of the instant motion. Nonetheless, other problems remain with \nthe purported typicality of this class definition. As it stands, the fifth subdefinition details a \nfactual scenario that is not typical ofthe class members. There is no allegation that there was \na policy of delaying people who have been deemed \"releasable.\" Therefore, the instant class \ndefinition embraces a claim that could conceivably only embrace the named Plaintiffs who \nhave asserted this claim. Furthermore, the Court notes that the claim for delay in release is \natypical even among the named Plaintiffs. For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish typicality for the purposes of the instant class definition. \nFor all of the reasons discussed supra, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \nestablished the requirements set for in Rule 23(a). \n-11-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 12 of 15\nC.  Timing. \nAll of the named Plaintiffs were searched pursuant to a strip search policy that ended \non June 1, 1999. The proposed class definition, however, encompasses the period between \nMay 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing Defendants to cease \ntheir policy. As such, the proposed class is currently unbounded in both its size and time. The \nnumber of people falling within that proposed class and the circumstances of their cases are \npractically impossible to predict. \nPlaintiffs provide no support for such an unbounded class. The Court is aware that \nclass precision is less important in the Rule 23(b )(2) context. See Anderson v. Coughlin, 119 \nF.R.D.  1,  3  (N.D.N.Y.  1988).  However,  both Rule  23(b)(2)  and  Rule  23(b)(3)  class \ncertification is sought by Plaintiffs. Moreover, the instant class is so imprecisely defined that \nthe Court feels it may be unworkable. Finally the Court notes that it is appropriate for the \nCourt to ensure that the class definition is \"precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.\" \nNicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 97 (E.D.N.Y. 2001). For these reasons, the Court \nconcludes that further briefing is appropriate regarding the time limits on the proposed class \ndefinition. \nD.  Additional Problems with the Instant Class Definition. \nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs again seek class certification for those acts where \nDefendants have conceded liability. For the reasons discussed in both the Court's September \n-12-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 13 of 15\n23 Order and the October 27 Order, the Court declines to certify a class that would include \nacts for which liability is  conceded. Since Plaintiffs'  current proposed class definition \nembraces such conceded causes of action, even under Defendants' amended concession of \nliability, this definition is framed improperly. \nIn addition, the Court harbors doubts that the named Plaintiffs are representative of \nthe putative class. Plaintiffs now seek to certify a class, in part, as to individuals that were \nsearched pursuant to an alleged post-Shain policy of searching all non-felony admitees to \nNCCC. Due to the vintage of the instant case, none of the named Plaintiffs were searched \npursuant to that alleged policy. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the named Plaintiff can \nadequately represent that portion of the proposed class. \nFinally, the Court notes that instant class definition embraces individuals that were not \nincluded in the prior class definitions. In particular, the Court notes that a class based upon \ndelays in being released are wholly inconsistent with all of Plaintiffs' prior class definitions. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that a class embracing searches other than those made upon \ninitial admittance into NCCC, i.e. searches embraced by the facts of the Shain case, is clearly \ninconsistent with the definition addressed in the September 23 Order. Accordingly, the only \ntruly inconsistent position advanced by the parties in the context of the instant cross-motions \ncomes from Plaintiffs, not from Defendants. \nIt is unclear what consequences flow from the fact that Plaintiffs' current position is \ninconsistent with their position during the previous five years of this litigation. However, \n-13-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 14 of 15\ninconsistently alleged classes have been found to support the denial of motions to certifY \nclasses in other cases. See Cavallo v. Utica-Watertown Health Ins. Co .. Inc., 191 F.R.D. 342, \n346 (N.D.N.Y. 2000); cf. W. Alton Jones Foundation v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 97 F.3d 29, \n35 (2d Cir. 1996); Soranno v. New York Life Ins. Co., No. 96-CV- 7882, 2001 WL 290303, \nat *3 (N.D. Ill. March 20, 2001); Ernest P. Kline & Eugene F. Knopf. v. First Western \nGovernment Securities. Inc .. eta!., No. 83-CV-1076, 1996 WL 153641, at *12 (E.D.Pa. \nJanuary 24, 1996). As such, the Court feels obliged to note some of the inconsistencies in \nPlaintiffs' class definitions. \nE.  Rule 23(b) (2) and Rule 23(b) (3). \nBecause of the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have not satisfied 23(a), the Court \ndoes not reach the propriety of certifYing the proposed class definition under Rule 23(b) (2) \nor Rule 23(b )(3). \nIII.  CLASS  CERTIFICATION  UPON  THE  DEFINITION  ADVANCED IN \nCONNECTION WITH THE SEPTEMBER 23 ORDER. \nPlaintiffs suggest that, should the instant class definition not warrant certification, the \nCourt should certifY a class pursuant to the definition earlier provided in connection with the \nSeptember 23 Order. The Court disagrees. As discussed supra, the Court does not find any \nsubstantive difference between Defendants two concessions. For this reason, the prior class \n-14-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 15 of 15\ndefinition  would fail  for  the  identical  reasons  articulated in the  September 23  Order. \nAccordingly, the Court declines to certify a class based upon that earlier submitted, and \npreviously rejected, class definition. \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS. \nFor the reasons discussed supra, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to change \ntheir concession ofliability and DENIES Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. \nSO ORDERED \n/s/ \nJ \nDated:  Central Islip, New York \nAugust 20, 2004  - -UilrtedStirtes Dlstrict Judge \n-15-",
