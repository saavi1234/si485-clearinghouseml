    "summary": "<p>On December 17, 2002, a pre-trial detainee filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the  U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, challenging the Knox County Sheriff's policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches and visual body cavity searches in Knox County Jail.  Plaintiff alleged that officers subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches regardless of the crime charged and without having reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.</p><p>The defendants denied those allegations and asserted that their policies, practices and procedures were at all times consistent with constitutional requirements. </p><p>The District Court (Senior District Judge Gene Carter) certified the case as a class action, defining the class as: All people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox County Jail:  (1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or (2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or (3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or (4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332 (D. Me. 2003), affirmed by Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004) (Circuit Judge Michael Boudin).</p><p>Discovery and litigation continued, with the Judge Carter issuing various discovery and procedural orders.  See Tardiff v. Knox County, 224 F.R.D. 522 (D. Me. 2004) (holding that reinsurance agreements between self-funded insurance pool of counties and its reinsurers were subject to discovery);  Tardiff v. Knox County, 226 F.R.D. 10 (D. Me. 2005) (plaintiff was required to identify class members from county's jail log sheets without the assistance of the County); Tardiff v. Knox County, 2006 WL 2827604 (D. Me. Sept. 11, 2006) (limiting the scope of testimony for defendants' expert witness);  Tardiff v. Knox County, 2006 WL 2827600 (D. Me. Sept. 18, 2006) (denying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of a prior order);  Tardiff v. Knox County, 2006 WL 2827603 (D. Me. Sept. 18, 2006) (order denying plaintiffs' motion for judicial determination of the number of people in the class);   Tardiff v. Knox County, 453 F.Supp.2d 190 (D. Me. Sept. 21, 2006) (striking all of the parties exhibits for violating a court order directing preparation of consolidated exhibit list); and Tardiff v. Knox County, 2006 WL 3043223 (D. Me. Oct. 24, 2006) (approving substitution of the named class representative).</p><p>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which Judge Carter granted in part and denied in part.  He held the County's blanket strip search policy unconstitutional, but said there were fact issues regarding the claims of several class members that needed to be resolved.  He determined that the Sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity for searches of detainees alleged to have committed non-violent, non-weapons, non-drug felonies, but was not entitled to immunity for searches of detainees alleged to have committed misdemeanors.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 397 F.Supp.2d 115 (D. Me. 2005).   In Tardiff v. Knox County, 425 F.Supp.2d 159 (D. Me. 2006), Judge Carter clarified and denied reconsideration of his summary judgment order and denied a certificate of appealability in Tardiff v. Knox County, 451 F.Supp.2d 253 (D. Me. 2006). </p><p>On September 19, 2006, the Court bifurcated the remaining liability and damages issues.  The case was ordered to proceed to determine liability (as to the class) and then would thereafter proceed as a non-class action with regard to determining individual amounts of recoverable compensatory and punitive damages.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 2006 WL 2827556 (D. Me. Sept. 19, 2006). The parties then participated in a Judicial Settlement Conference with Chief District Judge George Z. Singal on September 29, 2006, and settled the case.  </p><p>The initial Settlement Agreement was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval, but rejected.  Dare v. Knox County, 457 F.Supp.2d 52 (D. Me. 2006).  After several modifications, a third version of Settlement Agreement was preliminarily approved on December 18, 2006.  Dare v. Knox County, 465 F.Supp.2d 14 (D. Me. 2006).  In accordance with the revised Settlement Agreement, the Court entered an Injunction prohibiting Knox County, its Sheriff, and all jail employees from strip searching any persons charged with a crime that did not involve weapons, violence or controlled or scheduled substances during the jail admission process, unless the officer or person conducting the strip search had reasonable suspicion to believe the person does possess a weapon, controlled or scheduled substances, or other contraband.  Dare v. Knox County, 465 F.Supp.2d 17 (D. Me. 2006).</p><p>Following a final fairness hearing on April 23, 2007, Judge Carter approved the settlement.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the County agreed to pay the sum of $3 million for settlement of all class claims.  From that amount, attorneys' fees in the amount of $750,000.00 (25%) were paid to class counsel, as well as litigation costs of class counsel, claims administration expenses, and class representative bonuses. The remainder was to be distributed equally to class members that timely submitted a claim, regardless of the number of times that they were booked into the jail and searched during the class period.   See also Dare v. Knox County, 2007 WL 2071787 (D. Me. July 09, 2007) (approving $23,822.74 in litigation costs to class counsel).  </p><p>The PACER docket reflects that in January 2008, Judge Carter ordered that unclaimed portions of the settlement fund went to a charity pusuant to the \"cy pres\" doctrine.  We have no further information showing activity in the case. </p>",

The Court held a hearing on this motion \n                                                 \n1   The original putative class member designated as the named plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was \npermitted to withdraw as a class representative by the Court’s Order of October 24, 2006 (Docket Item No. \n367) and Dale Dare, another original putative class member, was substituted for her by that Order.  The \ncase is now properly styled Dare v. Knox County, et al., Civ. No. 02-251-P-C. \n\non October 24, 20062 and declined to preliminarily approve that Agreement.  See Docket \nItem No. 368. \n  The Court notes that the agreement does now provide for a second opportunity for \nputative class members to request exclusion as permitted by Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(e)(3).  See Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) VI, \n¶10, at 10; Order on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368). \n  The Court further notes that the parties have achieved resolution by agreement of \nall issues respecting the entry of injunctive relief by the parties agreeing to the Court’s \nentry of its Amended Proposed Permanent Injunction, see Docket Item No. 364.  The \nThird Final Settlement Agreement now provides specifically: \n“The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction[,] the \npurpose of which will be to ensure the Defendants’ compliance with \nFourth Amendment law governing strip searches.  The parties have agreed \non the terms of the injunction which are set forth in the Court’s Amended \n                                                 \n2   As a result of prior settlement negotiations of the parties in conference with Chief Judge Singal, \nthe class counsel filed on October 10, 2006 a proposed Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 339) \nwith a Motion Seeking Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 338).  The Defendants’ \ncounsel submitted on the same date its own version of a Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. \n342).  The Court held a conference/hearing with counsel and the parties on October 11, 2006 in open court, \nand it appeared that there were significant variations in the two proposals.  The parties were left to resume \nnegotiations following the conference/hearing to see if a definitive proposed Settlement Agreement could \nbe arrived at by them.  See Transcript (Docket Item No. 357).  They subsequently filed a second Settlement \nAgreement (Docket Item No. 351). \n \n  The situation in respect to settlement was further complicated by the position taken by the named \nclass representative, Laurie Tardiff, at the conference/hearing that she objected to the terms of the \nSettlement and wished to withdraw as class representative in the action.  The Court advised her to promptly \nconsult individual counsel and on October 13, 2006 new counsel entered an appearance on her behalf \n(Docket Item Nos. 346 and 349).  Since then, class counsel has filed a Motion to Strike Laurie Tardiff as \nClass Representative (Docket Item No. 350), which was later withdrawn (Docket Item No. 354). The Court \nsubsequently granted a Motion, filed by class counsel, to Substitute a Party, Dale Dare, as Class \nRepresentative (Docket Item No. 355) and a Motion filed by Ms. Tardiff’s personal counsel to withdraw \nMs. Tardiff as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 356). \n \n  The Court scheduled all these pending matters for further conference/hearing on October 24, 2006.  \nA further conference of the Court and counsel was held on the record (See Docket Item No. 375) on \nNovember 27, 2006.  As a result of further negotiations of counsel, the presently pending Third Final \nSettlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) has been filed and substituted for Docket Item No. 351.  It is \nthis latter agreement on which the Court now acts. \n \n  2\n\n[Proposed] Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 364), and all parties waive their rights to appeal the \nentry of, or terms of, this injunctive Order.” \n \nSee Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) at 3-4; Court’s Amended \nProposed Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement at 1 (Docket Item No. \n364); Order on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368) at 3. \n  Otherwise, the Court finds that the notice that the parties have proposed with the \nrevisions made on the record by this Court today amounts to “notice in a reasonable \nmanner” as required by Rule 23(e)(1)(B).  The Court hereby ORDERS that: \n(1)  The Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1 to \n376-8) be, and it is hereby, PRELIMINARILY APPROVED for \npurposes of issuance of direct class-wide notice and further \nproceedings, as revised, and that direct class-wide notice thereof \nissue forthwith as per Docket Item No. 376-2 as revised; \n \n(2)  Any motion for attorney’s fees and nontaxable costs shall be filed \nby such a time that the Rule 23(h)(1) notice of the fee request can \nbe combined with the Rule 23(e) notice of settlement and be sent \nto the class at the same time and that any such motion be supported \nin detail.  See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 801 \nF. Supp. 804 (D.Me. 1992); \n     \n(3)  The exhibits to the Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket \nItem No. 376-1) that is, Docket Item Nos. 376-2 through 376-8, be, \nand are hereby APPROVED as revised; \n \n(4)  All putative class members may exercise a right to opt out of the \nThird Final Settlement Agreement in conformity with the \nAgreement’s terms; \n \n(5)  A hearing under Rule 23(e)(1)(c) is hereby scheduled to take place \non April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. on whether the settlement is fair, \nreasonable and adequate; whether any requests for attorney fees \nand nontaxable costs should be allowed and, if so, the extent of \nsuch allowance; and resolution of any other issues then properly \nbefore the Court.  The Court will hear appropriate objections on all \nthose matters at that time.  See Rule 23(e)(4)(A), (h)(2) and (h)(3); \n \n  3\n\n(6)  The Court’s Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Third Final \nSettlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 379) shall issue forthwith. \n \n  The Court does not intend this order to be a preliminary fairness determination.  \nBecause, as the Court has indicated in its prior Order, a judicial determination of \n“preliminary fairness” unjustifiably suggests a headwind against objections to the \nsettlement agreement, the Court will only determine at the final approval hearing whether \nthe proposed Third Final Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the \nclass action settlement in this case. \n  The Court NOTES that Ms. Tardiff, the previously designated class \nrepresentative, presently remains as a putative class member.  The Court is not asked to \nmake, and does not make, any decision as to her rights in this litigation and intimates no \nopinion on any matter bearing on such subject, or whether she is subject to being bound \nby any Settlement Agreement proposed herein or that may be finally approved by the \nCourt.  The Court’s ultimate resolution of any such issues, if any, shall not be a basis for \nany party or class member to challenge, inter partes, the viability or enforceability of the \nThird Final Settlement Agreement of the class action, if it is finally approved by the \nCourt. \n  It is FURTHER ORDERED that class counsel proceed with the execution of the \norders and instructions provided for herein necessary to the implementation of the \nsettlement preparatory to the final fairness hearing on April 23, 2007. \n              /s/Gene Carter_________________ \n              GENE CARTER \n              Senior United States District Judge \n \nDated at Portland, Maine this 18th day of December, 2006. \n \n  4",

Civil No. 02-251-P-C \n  \nKNOX COUNTY and DANIEL DAVEY, in   \nhis individual capacity and in his official \ncapacity as Knox County Sheriff, \n  \n                               Defendants   \n \nGene Carter, Senior District Judge \n \nORDER FOR CLAIMS  \nADMINISTRATOR TO REEVALUATE CLAIM DENIALS  \n \n  The Court has discovered an error in the claim denial letter sent out by the Claims \nAdministrator explaining the reasons for denial of individual claims.  The form letter lists \nfive potential grounds for the denial of an individual’s claim and provides a box \npreceding each ground to be marked to indicate to the claimant the reason for the denial.  \nThe first ground for denial of a claim states: “Your strip search followed an arrest on \ncharges which involved weapons, violence or drugs.”  This is an erroneous statement of \nthe class definition.  The class certified by the Court in this case is defined as: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip \nsearch and/or visual body cavity search without evaluation for \nindividualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox \nCounty Jail: \n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did \nnot involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or  \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that \ndid not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; \nor  \n\n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on \ncharges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a \nviolent felony; or  \n \n(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did \nnot involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony.     \n \nDocket Item No. 21 at 6 (emphasis added).  To exclude only those individuals who fall \noutside the definition, the first ground for denial should properly state: “Your strip search \nfollowed an arrest on charges which involved weapons, drugs or a violent felony.”   \nApplication of the erroneously articulated standard may have led the Claims \nAdministrator to deny class membership to individuals who in fact satisfy the class \ndefinition.  Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that on or before June 25, 2007: \n(1) the Claims Administrator shall reevaluate, in light of the proper \nstandard for class membership, all the individual claims that were denied \non the first ground listed in the claim denial letter and correct any mistakes \nin the determination of class membership; \n   \n(2) the Claims Administrator shall file copies of all letters it sends to \nclaimants reversing, after reevaluation, a claim denial; \n \n(3) the Claims Administrator shall file copies of all the letters it previously \nsent to individuals, which denied claims based on the first ground listed in \nthe claim denial letter; \n \n(4) Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Robert Stolt Esq., shall file a certification \nstating that he has personally reevaluated with the Claims Administrator \nall of the individual claims that were denied on the basis of the erroneous \nstandard;  \n \n(5) Attorney Stolt’s certification shall include a listing of, and disposition \nfor, all of the reevaluated claims; and \n \n(6) Attorney Stolt shall file documentation to support the outcome of each \nreevaluation.         \n  \n           /s/ Gene Carter ____________________ \n            GENE CARTER \n            Senior United States District Judge \n \nDated at Portland, Maine this 18th day of June, 2007.   \n \n  2",

Dilworth, Kimberly L.\nMurphy, McCloskey, Mina & Cunniff, LLC, Portland, ME, for Defendants.\nORDER STRIKING PREVIOUSLY FILED EXHIBIT LISTS\nGENE CARTER, Senior District Judge.\nThe Court's ongoing review of the Docket in preparation for commencement of trial now scheduled for October 3,\n2006, has disclosed another pretrial instance of a clear violation of one of this Court's prior orders in respect to\npretrial preparation as specifically articulated in the Court's Pretrial Orders (Docket Items Nos. 181-1 and 187-2).\nThis tactic appears to be in execution of an apparent overarching strategy indulged by counsel to sow confusion\nin the pretrial record and involves the pretrial filing of a required \"Consolidated\" Exhibit List.\nThe Court previously stated in both pretrial orders, as part of its pretrial preparation Order, that:\n2. Counsel shall jointly prepare a consolidated and comprehensive list of all exhibits to be offered\nat trial. As to each listed exhibit, the list shall concisely describe it, identify it by identification\nmarking, note the sponsoring party, and indicate whether the sponsoring party expects to offer it in\nevidence or may offer it if the need arises and whether objection is anticipated, and, if so, on what\nbasis. The consolidated exhibit list (without the exhibits) shall be provided to the court with the trial\nbriefs.\nCounsel were provided with a form exhibit list which must be used at trial.\nReports of Final Pretrial Conference and Orders (Docket Item Nos. 181-1 and 187-2 at 8). That provision of those\nOrders, which is a provision routinely included in such orders by this Court, was intended to require counsel to\nmeet together and consider the specific, identifiable exhibits each intended to offer at trial, to give opposing\ncounsel timely notice of those exhibits, to discuss and determine if any of the proposed exhibits could be\nadmitted without objection or by stipulation, and, if to be the subject of objection, to so signal to counsel and the\nCourt with an indication of the likely basis of objection. It was intended that these, at least nominally collegial,\nendeavors would yield a single (e.g. thus the use of the word \"consolidated\" in the Orders) Exhibit List that\nreflected, for the convenience and economy of the Court and counsel at trial, the foregoing information. That\nrequirement is also intended by the Court to require counsel to focus on evidentiary determinations and postures\nbefore commencement of trial that will expedite the performance of counsel at trial, even perhaps sharpening\n192 counsels' understanding of the case and the problems of proof reasonably to be anticipated at trial, *192 as well\nas to alert the Court to likely evidentiary issues to be resolved at the trial so that their resolution can be\n\naccomplished with a minimum of delay, a maximum of accuracy, and a diminished need for extended rhetorical\n[1]\nindulgences of counsel at trial.\nProperly performed with a benign, willing and professionally responsible spirit and will, the preparation of a \nConsolidated Exhibit List will yield, as it is intended to do, positive benefits for the Court's considerations of trial\nissues and opportunities for sharpened performance and understanding by counsel. Thus, the requirement is not\none idly entered by this Court but is the considered result of the lessons derived and crystallized from almost\nthirty years of judicial trial experience. It is not intended to be ignored by counsel, blown off without comment, in\nthis or any other case.\nFar from responding to the requirement with any recognition, much less any zeal or respect, counsel in this case\nhave continued to indulge their counterproductive animadversions to inter-counsel etiquette and professional\ncourtesy and a complete disdain for orderly development of manageable and understandable trial conditions in\nthis case by total disregard of the Court's Orders in respect to the preparation of a Consolidated Exhibit List.\nThere now appears on the docket of this case a total of 30 pages of Exhibit Lists designated as original,\n\"supplemental,\" \"amended,\" and all repetitive and cumulative in nature. The Court, which has not been pleased\nfor a long time with the conduct of counsel in this case, is even less pleased now after this performance.\nThe subject filings consist of the following:\n1. Defendants' Exhibit List (Docket Item No. 260)-157 exhibits, five pages;\n[2]\n2. Plaintiffs'(?)  Exhibit List (Docket Item No. 262)-54 exhibits, five pages;\n3. Defendants' Exhibit List (Docket Item No. 267)-157 exhibits, six pages;\n193 *193 4. Defendants' Amended Exhibit List (Docket Item No. 269)-157 exhibits, six pages; and\n[3]\n5. Defendants' Second Amended Exhibit List (Docket Item No. 323)-284 exhibits, eight pages ;\nThe resulting state of the docket creates the likelihood, if not the certainty, absent the Court's therapeutic\nintervention, of the need for the Court and counsel to weed through a morass of repetitive, cumulative, and\nconfusing information in respect to pretrial notification of exhibits that will be fraught with great difficulty and which\nwill unnecessarily impede the efficient progress of the trial process. Avoidance of such contretemps is precisely\nthe result the Court's Order was intended to avoid. Counsel have never indicated to the Court that they have\neven attempted to create a Consolidated Exhibit List, and their filings give no hint that they have done so.\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that all Exhibit Lists filed herein prior to this date be, and they are hereby,\nSTRICKEN, including inter alia Docket Items Nos. 260, 262, 267, 269, and 323. It is hereby FURTHER\nORDERED that counsel shall forthwith meet face to face and prepare for filing in accordance with the Court's\nprior Orders (Docket Items Nos. 181-1 and 187-2 at 8) a Consolidated Exhibit List to contain the information\nindicated, supra at 2, and that said Consolidated Exhibit List be filed not later than three (3) days prior to the\nactual commencement of trial herein. In default of such a compliant filing, the Court will not consider any exhibit\noffered at trial to be timely noticed and will determine in the case of each exhibit tendered at trial the\nconsequences of that fact on the admissibility of the exhibit at trial.\nI mean for counsel to comply with this requirement. This Order is intended to be fair warning of that intention.\n[1] The need for the defining, regularizing, notice-giving effect of the Court's Order is especially pressing and\nimportant in the circumstances of this case. In accordance with standard practice in this Court see, Local Rule\n16.4(b), the parties filed Final Pretrial Memoranda and Amended Memoranda (Docket Items Nos. 169, 170, 178,\n256, and 257). In each filing, the parties indicated, respectively, as required by the Rule, \"[A] list of the documents\nand things the party intends to offer at trial.\" Local Rule 16.4(b). In the initial filings, the listings were by expansive\nand undefined categories of documents, such as all documents produced or listed in discovery, all Knox County\njail records for a specific period of years, all documents used in summary judgment proceedings, all documents\nproduced in discovery of either party and \"such other exhibits upon reasonable notice which were prepared or\n\nproduced in response to discovery and not referenced above.\" Docket Item # 170 VIII, 8, at 26. These expansive\ncategories proposed by Plaintiffs were adopted by Defendants in their responding Pretrial Memoranda as to\nidentification of exhibits intended to be offered by the Defendants at trial. As the filings went on, the listings of\nspecific documents in addition to these categories grew longer and longer. \nThe end result of this imaginatively illusory technique was that no party, nor anyone else, could have any idea,\nmuch less assurance, as to what was really proposed to be offered as an exhibit at trial in terms of meaningful\nnotice. Hence, there was created a hyper-invigorated compulsion and need in this case for the Court's Pretrial\nOrder to force counsel to come to grips with the specifics of their respective designations of the trial exhibits in\norder to ensure the fairness and efficiency of the use of all exhibits at trial.\n[2] This filing does not identify, by title or other notation, which party has filed it. The ECF automatic filing note\ndoes indicate that it was filed by Plaintiffs' counsel.\n[3] The successive filings give no indication of what occasioned the need for repetitive filings or of any differences\nin identity of listed witnesses among the various lists. Both opposing counsel and the Court are left to their own\ndevices to determine if there are, in fact, differences and if so, what they are.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

INTRODUCTION \n \n  The Defendants have filed, of even date, a proposed injunction.1  The Defendants have \npresented the Plaintiff with a detailed injunctive order, and have explained in separate \n                                                 \n1 The issue of circumstances under which the Defendants would conduct strip searches in the \nfuture was discussed during a judicial settlement conference.  At the conclusion of the \nconference the parties signed a Settlement Agreement drafted by the judicial officer conducting \nthe settlement.  The Agreement set forth certain specific terms of the agreement, and then \nreferred to the Amended Settlement Agreement in Nilsen v. York County with respect to \n“provision and procedures” contained therein.  This Settlement Agreement, drafted by the \njudicial officer, and signed by counsel for the parties, contained no reference to an injunction.  \nSubsequent to the settlement conference, however, Plaintiff insisted that an injunction had been \nagreed to. Defense counsel for the County and the Sheriff (Peter Marchesi, Esq. and John Wall, \nEsq.), independent counsel for the Sheriff (Toby Dilworth, Esq.), and independent counsel for \nthe County (Timothy Woodcock, Esq.) all concur that there was no agreement that an injunction \nwould issue.  To the contrary, consistent with the Settlement Agreement in Nilsen v. York \nCounty, the Defendants would agree to conduct strip searches in conformity with applicable law \nfrom the United States Supreme Court, the First Circuit and this Judicial District.  \nNotwithstanding their serious reservations about adding a term to the settlement not previously \ncontemplated specifically, and recognizing that an agreement to conform their conduct in a \ncertain respect would likely be as enforceable as a formal injunction, see generally Rufo v. \nInmates of the Suffolk County Jail, et al., 502 U.S. 367 (1992), the Defendants agreed to the \n  1\n\ncommunication to Plaintiff’s counsel the reasoning underlying the content of their proposed \norder.2 \n  The Defendants request that the injunctive Order embody two simple and straight \nforward provisions: (1) that the Order accurately reflect current law in the First Circuit with \nrespect to strip searches of pretrial detainees, and (2) that the injunction be flexible so that it is \ncoterminous with Fourth Amendment law from the United States Supreme Court, the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals and this Court with respect to strip searches of pretrial detainees, as that \nlaw may evolve in the future.  Stated simply, Defendants agree to conform their conduct to the \nlaw in this area as it exists not only at the present time, but as that law may evolve. Because the \nOrder proposed to the Defendants by the Plaintiff is overly restrictive with respect to the \ncircumstances under which strip searches may be conducted, and because, by its very terms, it \nprohibits future modifications, the Defendants cannot agree to that proposed Order.3 \nII.  MEMORANDUM OF LAW \nA.  THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW IN THE FIRST CIRCUIT PERMITS STRIP \n      SEARCHES ON ANY PERSON CHARGED WITH A CRIME INVOLVING WEAPONS, \n      DRUGS OR CONTRABAND, OR VIOLENT FELONIES, AND ON ANY PERSON FOR \n      WHOM THE CIRCUMSTANCES PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED REASONABLE \n      SUSPICION THAT SUCH PERSON IS CONCEALING DRUGS, WEAPONS OR OTHER \n      CONTRABAND. \n \n  At the present time, First Circuit law prohibits strip searches of individuals charged with \nminor offenses in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion.  Roberts v. Rhode Island, \n239 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nissuance of an injunction without agreeing to the content thereof.  Letter from Peter T. Marchesi, \nEsq. to Judge Gene Carter dated October 3, 2006. \n2   The order proposed to Plaintiff is the same order filed of even date. The communication to \nPlaintiff’s counsel is marked as Exhibit 1 and annexed hereto. \n3   The Order proposed by the Plaintiff to the Defendant is marked as Exhibit 2 and annexed \nhereto. \n  2\n\nReasonable suspicion may arise either from individual circumstances, or from the nature of the \ncrime that an individual is charged with.  Roberts at 112.  Whether the reasonable suspicion is \nbased upon the specific facts or circumstances of an individual’s arrest and incarceration, or \nupon the nature of the crime charged, the concept of contraband, apart from weapons and drugs, \nis significant.  Plaintiff’s proposed injuction fails to take this into account.  \n  It is unquestioned that strip searches may be justified by the belief, whether \nindividualized or based upon the nature of the crime charged, that an individual is concealing \ncontraband other than weapons or drugs.  Wood v. Hancock County, 354 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2003) \n(contact visits are a significant source of contraband in jails and . . . seemingly harmless items – \nsuch as pens and paper clips – can be transferred innocently and used in harmful ways).  The \nWood court cited two other cases for the proposition that contraband, other than weapons and \ndrugs, may pose serious security risks in the correctional setting.  Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. \n576, 586 (1994) ([v]isitors can easily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contraband . . .); Goff \nv. Nix, 803 F.3d 358, 364-65 (8th Cir. 1986) (. . . weapons, drugs, and other items of contraband \nare serious problems in our nation’s prisons). \n  The Defendants submit that the following is a correct statement of current First Circuit \nlaw with respect to strip searches of pretrial detainees:  “strip searches may be conducted on any \nperson charged with a crime involving weapons, drugs or other contraband, or violent felonies, \nand on any person for whom circumstances provide individualized reasonable suspicion that the \nperson is concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband”.  Stated in the negative, and in the \nform proposed by the Defendants’ proposed injunction: “strip searches may not be conducted on \nany person who is not charged with a crime involving weapons, drugs, or contraband, or with a \nviolent felony, unless there is a reasonable belief that that person is concealing drugs, weapons or \n  3\n\nother contraband”.  The Defendants submit that the language in their proposed injunctive Order \naccurately reflects the current state of the law in this circuit, and further submit that the language \ncontained in Plaintiff’s proposed Order is too restrictive in that it prohibits strip searches under \ncircumstances that are presently recognized as providing a constitutional basis for such searches. \nB.  THE DEFENDANTS REQUEST THAT ANY INJUNCTIVE ORDER NOT ONLY \n      ACCURATELY REFLECT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT \n      TO STRIP SEARCHES OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES, BUT THAT THE INJUNCTION \n      BE FLEXIBLE SO THAT ITS TERMS ARE MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE \n      EVOLUTION OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THESE SEARCHES. \n \n  The Defendants agree to conduct themselves within the bounds of the law4, but no more.  \nThe Defendants respectfully insist that any injunction be flexible, so as to evolve with \ndevelopments in the law, and to be coterminous with the law. \n  There is substantial support for the proposition that, if a party to litigation agrees to \nrefrain from conduct that is, or is believed to be, unconstitutional, and if it is subsequently \ndetermined that such conduct is in fact constitutional, the party may be nevertheless be held to \nthat agreement: \n    If it is clear that a party anticipated changing conditions that  \n    would make performance of the decree more onerous but  \n    nevertheless agreed to the decree, the party would have to  \n    satisfy a heavy burden to convince a court that it agreed to  \n    the decree in good faith, made a reasonable effort to comply  \n    with the decree, and should be relieved of the undertaking \n    . . . . \n \nRufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 385 (1992).  Here, as the Court and the \nPlaintiff are aware, the Defendants have long argued that both this Court and the First Circuit \nCourt of Appeals (beginning with its decision in Swain v. Spinney in 1997) have failed to adhere \n                                                 \n4   The Defendants have repeatedly asserted that their conduct has, at all times, both in policy and \npractice, conformed with constitutional requirements. \n  4\n\nto the analytical paradigm established by the United States Supreme Court in cases where \narrestees assert a violation of Fourth Amendment rights.  See, e.g., Defendants’ Motion for \nReconsideration,  Docket Item No. 150 ; Defendants’ Motion for Certification of Immediate \nAppeal, Docket Item No. 258.  If the Defendants were to agree to an Order requiring them to \nconduct themselves consistent with the state of the law as it exists today, and if that law were to \nchange in the future, the Defendants could be foreclosed from seeking modification of the \ninjunctive Order.5  The Plaintiff’s proposed injunctive Order, particularly if agreed to by the \nDefendants, would essentially foreclose the ability for modifications based upon changes in the \nlaw.  Specifically, the words “are forever enjoined and restrained” appear to be intended to \nforeclose future modifications.6  The Defendants’ proposed injunctive Order does two things: (1) \nit specifically provides, by its terms, that the Order shall be deemed modified so that it remains \nconsistent with the law as the law may evolve, and (2) to the extent there is disagreement in the \nfuture over whether and to what extent controlling Fourth Amendment law may have changed, \nsuch question shall be considered without regard to the standards of review set forth in Rufo. \n                                                 \n5  Ironically, this eventuality would be a one way street.  If the law were to become less \nrestrictive with respect to strip searches, it is possible that the Defendants would nevertheless be \nrequired to hew to the terms of the more restrictive state of the law that exists at the present time.  \nContrariwise, if the law were to become more restrictive with respect to strip searches, \nDefendants would find no safe harbor in the terms of the injunctive Order, and would be \nobligated to conform their conduct to be consistent with the change in the law.  Rufo v. Inmates \nof Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. at 388. \n6   It is noteworthy that the Defendants provided their proposed Order, and their explanation for \nthe terms of that Order, before Plaintiff presented her proposed Order.  It is apparent that the \nPlaintiff recognized the Defendants’ desire to seek future modifications of the Order based upon \nchanges in the law, and then specifically included language in their proposed Order that would \nforeclose such modifications. \n  5\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  The Defendants do not agree that they consented, as part of the Settlement Agreement \nsigned on September 29, 2006, to be bound to an injunctive Order.  However, the Defendants \nwill agree to the issuance of such an Oder, and have proposed an Order that they believe \naccurately states the substance of law in the First Circuit regarding strip searches of pretrial \ndetainees at the present, and that permits for modifications of the Order in the future based upon \nchanges in that law.  The Defendants will only agree to the entry of an Order that meets both of \nthose premises, and objects to the issuance of any Order that does not.  The Defendants reserve \nthe right to take an appeal from the issuance of an  injunctive Order that does not meet both of \nthose conditions, while at the same time complying with all agreed upon terms of the settlement \nreached in this case. \nDated:  October 10, 2006        WHEELER & AREY, P.A. \n \n \n \n              By____/s/ Peter T.

This injunction \nincorporates the Final Settlement Agreement signed by the Parties and approved by this Court as \nof October      , 2006, all documents incorporated therein.   \n1.  This Injunction is premised on the understanding  that the Parties have agreed that the \nsettlement of the claims raised in Laurie Tardiff v. Knox County embodies a \ncompromise by all Parties in their respective positions; specifically, this Injunction is \npremised on the understanding that the Defendants have denied and continue to deny \nliability and that Defendants’ denial is based, in part, on their view of the applicability \nvel non of Fourth Amendment1 to strip searches as they may be conducted at various \npoints in the “continuum from arrest to incarceration”2, and, in part, on their view of \nthe particular  policies, practices pertaining to strip searches of individuals at issue in \n                                                 \n1 IV Amend., U.S. Const.  \n2 Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 644  (1983).   \n \n{EP - 00038385 - v1 - 15894.14 - 10/5/2006 08:30 AM}\n\nthe instant case, as well as specific strip searches of specific individuals at issue in \nthis case violated Fourth Amendment privacy rights  of those searched.; this \nInjunction recognizes that Defendants’ denial of liability on these issues and all others \ncomprehended by Tardiff v. Knox County, et al., was and remains an essential term \nfor settlement of this case;  \n2.  This injunction is further premised on the understanding that the Fourth Amendment \nclaims raised in Tardiff v. Knox County, et al. are based on court interpretations of the \nFourth Amendment and that, as such, Fourth Amendment may evolve and change \nbased on court decisions issued after the effective date of this Injunction.   It is the \nintent of the Parties and an essential premise of this Injunction that Defendants’ \nobligations herein shall be coterminous with  controlling authority on Fourth \nAmendment law governing as that authority may evolve and change after the \neffective date of this Injunction irrespective whether that authority is more or less \nrestrictive of such searches  than the authority in effect as of the date of this \nInjunction.    \n3.  In the event that the Parties disagree over whether and to what extent controlling \nauthority on Fourth Amendment law may have changed at any time after the effective \ndate of this Injunction, such question shall be considered without regard to the \nstandards of review set forth in Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. \n367 (1992) or any other standard for the review of Injunctions, Consent Decrees or \nsimilar orders or agreements and the sole question shall be whether and to what extent \ncontrolling authority governing Fourth Amendment law has changed.  Such \ndetermination shall be appealable by either party de novo as a matter of law. \n \n{EP - 00038385 - v1 - 15894.14 - 10/5/2006 08:30 AM}\n\n \nWHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT,  \n1.  Arrestees being held on misdemeanor charges may be strip searched as part of \nthe booking process only if officers have reasonable suspicion that the arrestee \npossesses weapon or weapons, controlled substances, or contraband. \n2.  Arrestees being held on felony charges may be strip searched as part of the \nbooking process only if (a) the charge involves violence, weapons or \ncontrolled substances or (b) the officers have reasonable suspicion that the \narrestee possesses a weapon or weapons, controlled substances or contraband. \n3.  The Parties, individually and collectively, retain the right to seek a \nmodification of this Injunction to conform with any changes in controlling \nauthority governing the circumstances under which strip searches may or may \nnot be conducted and the standards applicable to such determinations. \n \nDated:______________________      ______________________________ \n              Gene Carter, Senior United States \n              District Court Judge  \n \n{EP - 00038385 - v1 - 15894.14 - 10/5/2006 08:30 AM}",

This is a civil rights action for money damages against Knox County, Knox \nCounty Sheriff, Daniel Davey, and Correctional Officers Jane Doe and John Doe \nfor injuries caused by the unconstitutional strip search of the Plaintiffs. \n2.  The named Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, seeks to represent a class of men and women \nwho were admitted to the Knox County Jail while waiting for b~il to be set, or for \nan initial court appearance, or were arrested on arrest warrants, or charged with \n\n·/ \nmisdemeanors, or charged with felonies which would not give rise to a reasonable \nsuspicion of hiding contraband, drugs, or weapons on their bodies. Included in \nthis class are men and women who have been taken into custody by the Knox \nCounty Sheriffs Department, the Maine State Police, and the various police \ndepartments of Knox County. All the men and women of the class were \nincarcerated and housed at the Knox County Jail in Rockland, Maine. \n3.  Plaintiff and these other men and women have all been unlawfully subjected to \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches due to custom and practice adopted \nby Knox County and the Knox County Sheriff and implemented by the Knox \nCounty Sheriffs Department. The custom and practice of Knox County and the \nSheriff requires that every person committed to the custody of the Knox County \n. Jail be strip searched and subjected to a visual body cavity search without any \nreason to believe a strip search or visual body cavity search is necessary or \n-constitutionally permissible. \n4.  Plaintiff seeks to have this Court declare that these strip searches are \nunconstitutional and to enjoin the Defendants from conducting strip searches and \nvisual body cavity searches of women and men who are held awaiting bail, held \nfor initial court appearance, held on arrest warrants, on minor misdemeanor \ncharges, or on felony charges not raising a reasonable suspicion of the existence \nof contraband or dangerous weapons on the grounds that such searches violate \nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches under both \nthe Maine and United States Constitution. \n2 \nI \n\nJURISDICTION \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.c. §§ 1983 and 1988 and the Fourth, \nFifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Jurisdiction \nis founded upon 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \nPARTIES \n6.  The named Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was at all times relevant to this Complaint, a \nresident of the State of Maine.  , \n7.  The Defendant, Knox County, is a duly designated County in the State of Maine \nunder the Laws of the State of Maine. \n8.  The Defendant, Daniel Davey, was at all times relevant to this Complaint, the \nSheriff of Knox County. He is sued in his individual capacity and in his official \ncapacity as Knox County Sheriff. The actions of Defendant Davey alleged in this \nComplaint were taken under color of law. \n9.  The Defendant, Jane Doe, is a correctional officer employed by Knox County. \nShe is'sued in her individual capacity. \n10.  The Defendant, John Doe, is a correctional officer employed by Knox County. He \nis sued in his individual capacity. \n11.  The actions of Defendants Jane Doe and John Doe alleged in this Complaint were \ntaken under color oflaw of the State of Maine. \n3 \nI \n\nFACTS \n12.  On February 7,2001, at approximately 5:05 p.m., Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was \narrested at her residence, 53 Granite Street, Rockland, Maine by Rockland Police \nOfficer Patrick Allen. She was allegedly arrested for tampering with a witness. \n13.  According to said Officer Allen, Ms. Tardiffwas arrested pursuant to an arrest \nwarrant. \n14.  Prior to leaving home, Ms. Tardiff was required to empty her pockets in front of \nOfficer Patrick Allen. \n15.  Ms. Tardiff, while under arrest, was taken to the Knox County Jail. \n16.  After arriving at the jail, Ms. Tardiff was booked in the intake area. \n17.  An unidentified officer of the Knox County Corrections Department asked that \nMs. Tardiff remove her overcoat and took it from her. \n18.  At that time, Ms. Tardiffwas only wearing a lingerie see-through shirt under her \novercoat. She had on no brassiere. \n19.  She asked Corrections Officer, Edward Colson, if she could have a men's \nsweatshirt to put on to cover up her chest. He refused. \n20.  Also present at the time were Officers Kenny Hooper and Jay Costigan. Ms. \nTardiff asked them for something to cover up with. Officer Costigan refused \nsaying, \"He didn't have time for that.\" \n21.  Ms. Tardiffwas left standing there in a partially clad state for approximately ten \nminutes. During this time, five or more members of the Knox County Corrections \n4 \nI \n\nDepartment and several inmates were able to observe Ms. Tardiff in her partially \nclad state. \n22.  After this, Ms. Tardiffwas removed to a shower area. \n23.  A female correction officer strip searched her. \n24.  She was told to remove her clothing. \n25.  She was told to squat and cough, exposing her vagina and anal cavity to the \ncorrections officer. \n26.  She was required to repeat the squat and cough procedure three times. \n27.  The search ofthe Plaintiff conformed to the custom and practice of the Knox \nCounty Sheriff s Department. \n28.  After this, she was held for approximately 23 Yz hours without bail. \n29.  Plaintiff suffered extreme emotional distress as a result of the strip search and \nvisual body cavity search conducted at the Knox County Jail. \n30.  Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was shocked by the incident. Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, \nfelt humiliated, degraded and violated. \n31.  The strip search of the Plaintiff by Defendant Jane Doe did not conform to the \nwritten strip search policy of the Defendant, Knox County, and specifically, \nSheriff Department Policy Number C-120. \n32.  The strip search policy of Knox County and the custom and practice of the \n.sheriffs Department are unconstitutional. \n33.  The custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriff's Department is not in \nkeeping with the Knox County Sheriff Department's own vlritten policy regarding \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches. \n5 \nI \n\n• \nr\" \n34.  It is the custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriffs Department to strip \nsearch every person taken into custody regardless of the length of time the person \nis to be held or the charges against the person. \n35.  It is the custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriffs Department to strip \nsearch each individual whether the individual is housed in a holding cell for a \nshort period of time or mixed with the general population of the jail. \n36.  It is the custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriffs DepaJ.ime~t to strip \nsearch each individual whether the individual is charged with a misdemeanor or a \nfelony. \n37.  It is the custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriff s Department to strip \nsearchCevery woman and man taken into custody by the Knox County Corrections \nDepartment. \n38.  The Knox County Sheriffs Department conducts strip searches and body cavity \nsearches of all women and men who are admitted to the jail whether they are \ncharged with a misdemeanor or a felony, whether they are waiting for a bail \nbondsman or an initial court appearance, whether they are arrested on warrants, \nand whether they are held in a holding cell temporarily or mixed with the general \npopUlation. \n39.  In accb'rdance with the authority and provisions contained in 34-A M.R.S.A. \n§ 1208, the Department of Corrections is authorized and required to conduct \nbiennial reviews of each jail in the State of Maine. The Knox County Jail was \ncited as deficient in at least two recent biennial inspection reports, 1994 and 2000 \nfor strip searching all women and men taken into custody: \n·6 \nI \n\n40.  The case involving Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, will not alone resolve the issue. In a \nrecent case, Knox County was sued by Cannen Miller, a resident of Rockport, \nMaine. In 1996, Ms. Miller was stopped for an invalid inspection sticker. She was \narrested when a license check erroneously detennined that she had an outstanding \narrest warrant. She was j ailed over Patriots Day Weekend and subj ected to four \nseparate strip searches during her period of incarceration. This was two years after \nthe 1994 Biennial Inspection Report cited the Knox County Jail as deficient for \nwrongfully strip searching men and women. In February of2001, after jury \nselection, Ms. Miller settled her claim against Knox County in Federal Court. One \nweek prior to settlement, on the day Ms. Miller picked her jury, Ms. Tardiffwas \nunconstitutionally strip searched at the Knox County Jail. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n41.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a)(b)(I),(2) and (3) ofthe Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure by Plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all women and \nmen ,*ho were or will in the future be: \na)  Taken into custody at the Knox County Jail before arraignment, or after ~m \narrest, whether or not pursuant to a warrant; and \nb)  Subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search at the Knox County \nJ ail in violation of its own policy but pursuant to the de facto policy practice \nor custom of conducting strip searches and visual body cavity searches of \nevery person admitted to the jail. \n7 \nI \n\n( \n42.  The named Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, is a member of the class. The class \nrepresented by the Plaintiff is so numerous that joinder of all such persons is \nimpractical. On information and belief, the number of class members is more than \nfive thousand people. The custom and practice of strip searching all men and \nwomen who came into the jail has existed for more than 10 years. \n43.  There are questions oflaw and fact that are common to the class of Plaintiffs. \nCentral to all the claims is the constitutionality of the policy andlor practice of the \nKnox County Sheriff to routinely conduct strip searches and visual body cavity \nsearches. \n44.  Plaintiff's claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the class of \nPlaintiffs. \n45.  Plaintiffwill fairly and accurately represent and protect the interests of the \nmembers of the class. The attorneys for the Plaintiff are experienced and capable \nin civilrights litigation and have successfully represented Plaintiffs in other civil \nrights litigation, including cases alleging unlawful strip searches, and in particular \nthe case of Carmen Miller v. Knox County. Counsels have the resources and \nexpertise to prosecute this action. \n46.  TIllS a.ction is properly maintainable as a class action because the prosecution of \nseparate actions by the individual members of the class would create inconsistent \nand varying adjUdications with respect to individual members .of the class, which \nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants. \n47.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action because the prosecution of \nseparate actions would create a risk of adjudication with respect to individual \n8 \nI \n\nmembers ofthe class, which would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members who are not parties or substantially impair or \nimpede their ability to protect their interests. \n48.  The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \n49.  As a direct result of the errant policy and/or custom and practice, class members \nhave been subject to unlawful strip searches and visual body cavity searches, \nwhich has caused each member of the class to endure pain and suffering and \nmental anguish. \nCOUNT 1: 42 U.S.C. §1983 DEFENDANT, KNOX COUNTY \n50.  The Plaintiff repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 49 of the Complaint as if \nmore fully set forth herein. \n51.  The errant policy and/or custom and practice of the Knox County Sheriffs \nDepartment of strip searching and conducting visual body cavity searches of all \nmen and women taken into custody violates the United States Constitution, the \nConstitution of the State of Maine, and State Law. \n52.  By the actions described above, the Defendant has deprived the Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Plaintiff Class of their clearly established right guaranteed by the \nConstitution of the United States to be free from an unreasonable search and \nseIzure. \n53.  The Defendant, Knox County, by and through its agents, servants, and/or \nemployees, knowingly and in deliberate indifference to the Constitutional Rights \n9 \nI \n\nof the citizens of Knox County and the State of Maine, maintained and permitted \nofficial policies and customs of permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs \nset forth herein above. These policies and customs include, but are not limited to, \nthe deliberately indifferent training of their employees in matters pertaining to \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches. \n54.  Plaintiff, on information and belief, alleges that such errant policies and/or \ncustoms and practices of the Defendants were the moving force behind the \nviolation of Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiffs rights and the Defendants, each ofthem, are \nliable for all of the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff as set forth herein above. \n55.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, Plaintiff suffered injuries \nincluding, but not limited to: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, mental anguish, \nembarrassment, invasion of privacy, violation of constitutional rights, and \ndepravation of constitutional rights. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \nA.  Certify the class and appoint Laurie Tardiff, Plaintiff, to serve as the \nnamed Plaintiff representing the entire class of people subjected to \nunconstitutional strip searches by Knox County. \nB.

Defendant Davey !mew or should have !mown that it was clearly established law \nas of 1986 that ... \"no law enforcement officer reasonably could have believed \n11 \nI \n\n-, \nthat it was permissible to perform such a search absent indIvidualized reasonable \nsuspicion\" Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3Td 56, {2nd Cir. 2001.}. \n61.  Defendant Davey established and enforced the policy and practice of conducting \nroutine strip searches and body cavity searches, without legal authority or any \nreason to believe the men and women so searched had anything concealed on his \nor her person. \n62.  Defendant Davey implemented and maintained this strip search policy and \npractice. \n63.  As a result of Defendant Davey's conduct, Plaintiff was subjected to the strip \nsearch described above. \n64.  Even after Defendant Davey had actual notice that the policy and practice of strip . \nsearching women and men was unconstitutional, he continued to enforce that \nunconstitutional policy and practice. \n65.  .

Plaintiffs propose that individual notice be mailed to \nidentified potential class members, if and when, Plaintiffs are able to generate a list of potential \nclass members for the time period from November 19, 1996 forward.  Further, in order to \nincrease the likelihood of reaching the maximum possible number of potential class members, \nand because development of a mailing list seems unlikely, Plaintiffs propose additional notice \nby publication in three (3) newspapers, by radio, by local cable and off-air television, by press \nrelease and publicity, and by notice posted at the booking desk of the Knox County Jail.  As \ngrounds for this motion, Plaintiffs state the following: \n  1.  Plaintiffs obtained available computerized booking data from the Knox County \nSheriff's Department for a portion of the time period of November, 1996 through June, 2004.  \nSee Affidavit of Robert J. Stolt at Paragraphs 2 and 8.  Plaintiffs are working to construct this \ndata into a Microsoft Access database.  Id at Paragraph 4.   \n\n  2.  The raw data retrieved from the jail  was produced to the Defendant.  Id at \nParagraph 3.  This data is a complete copy of the data obtained at the Jail by Plaintiff's \ncomputer experts and the \"Excel files\" previously provided to Plaintiffs by Defendants.   \n  3.  Since obtaining the electronic data, my office, including Keith Varner, Esq., Spencer \nTracy, other members of the firm's staff and me, in conjunction with our computer consultants, has \nworked diligently to organize, sort and transfer the data obtained into a Microsoft Access Database.  In \norganizing and transferring the data all of the original data fields and data tables have been preserved. \n  4.  My office staff has had great difficulty in sorting and organizing the data because many \nof  the  database  fields  were  either  not  completed  or  completed  inaccurately  by  jail  data  entry \nemployees.  The information we retrieved from the jail had been entered initially in an extremely \nincomplete and haphazard manner.   \n  5.  Staff members of my office are currently working to validate and verify the electronic \nrecords by cross-checking each record of arrest, booking, housing, release, intake and identity in the \ndata sets.  This includes comparing the Spillman data with data obtained earlier in discovery.  This \nearlier discovery consists of Microsoft Excel apparently randomly saved by Corrections Sergeant \nCostigan.  The databases we are working with contain more than 300,000 lines of data.  Each line must \nbe individually examined to be either attached to the appropriate detainee or removed from the data \nset. \n  6.  The data and records maintained by the jail have several significant time period gaps.  \nAs an example, there are no paper or electronic records for March, June and July, 1997 or for August, \nSeptember, October, November and December 1998.  There are no electronic records for the periods \nMay through November 2001 and May through August 2002.  There are few records for the period \nAugust 2002 to March 2003.  The gaps in the electronic records may be able to be filled by paper \nrecords, but search of the paper records is an arduous process.     \n  2\n\n  7.  The data screening and organizing process has been made more difficult because of the \npoor quality of the data.  The initial databases created at the Knox County Jail are incomplete, \ninaccurate, inconsistent, incoherent and, in many cases, incomprehensible.   My office staff members \nhave spent many hours trying to match and validate entries.  We have reached the limit of our ability to \nrefine the data electronically.  We are now manually \"scrubbing\" the data to produce a reasonable list \nof class members.  \n  8.  All of my office staff members, to some degree, have been engaged in this scrubbing \nprocess.  I anticipate that the production of a partially complete, useable database of some class \nmembers with reasonably correct identifiers and reasonably accurate arrest, booking, housing and \nrelease data will take many weeks if it can be produced at all. \n  9.  After the data has been scrubbed, Plaintiffs propose to send individual notice by \nmail to all identifiable potential class members at the addresses recorded in the booking data \nprovided by the Jail.  Plaintiff is uncertain that booking data provided by the Jail will result in a \nusable mailing list of potential class members.  A copy of the proposed notice designed to be \nsent by mail to potential class members, if any, identified by the electronic booking data, is \nattached to this motion as Exhibit A.  Class counsel drafted the Notice to include \"plain \nEnglish\" answers to likely questions of class members as required by the 2003 amendment to \nRule 23.  The website address on the notice will be changed to provide the correct address once \nthe domain name is secured by class counsel. See Exhibit A at Paragraph 16.  Plaintiffs \npropose to make the deadline for potential class members to file notices of exclusion 90 days \nfrom the date the individual notices are mailed.  See id at 12. \n  10.  Additional  notice  is  necessary  to  reach  the  maximum  possible  number  of \npotential class members and because development of a mailing list seems unlikely. \n  3\n\n  11.  Plaintiffs propose posting a notice at the booking desk of the Knox County Jail. \nThe proposed notice is attached as Exhibit B.  Plaintiffs will provide the Defendants with an 11 \nx 14 version of this notice to be posted in a location that is visible to detainees during the \nbooking process. Plaintiffs will also provide 500 copies on standard 8 ½ x 11 paper, which can \nbe given out on request.  Plaintiffs will replenish this supply on request.  The 11 x 14 notice \nshould remain posted for at least six months unless the Court orders a different time period. \n  12.  Plaintiffs propose publishing a notice in three local newspapers.  The proposed \nnotice by publication is attached as Exhibit C.  Plaintiffs propose that this notice be published \nthree times each in the Times Record; The Courier Gazette; and The Camden Herald. \n  13.  Plaintiffs further propose publishing a notice by advertising, press releases and \npublicity over local radio and television via local cable and off-air broadcast.  \n  14.  This case has received some publicity in local newspaper articles and on local \nradio and television broadcasts.  These media publicity reports have generated some direct \ncontact between some potential class members and class counsel.  The individual notice will be \nmailed to those people and to any others who contact class counsel in the future, if they appear \nto meet the class definition. \n  15.  This notice is filed in conjunction with Plaintiffs' motion, contemporaneously \nfiled, for an \"order in aid of identification of class members\".  Here, Plaintiffs ask the court to \napprove the concept of Plaintiffs proposal for class notification subject to identification of class \nmembers pursuant to Plaintiffs proposed order on its motion for \"order in aid of identification \nof class members\". \n  WHERFORE, Plaintiffs move this Court to approve the notice plan and the attached \nnotices of the Court's class certification decision pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)(B). \n  4\n\nDated: September 15, 2004 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \nthe Plaintiffs, individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,  \nBy their attorneys, \n \n \n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)\n(cid:2)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:3)\n(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:3)\n(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:31) (cid:3)!(cid:3)(cid:27)\"(cid:30)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:26)(cid:11)(cid:28)(cid:11)(cid:3)\n##$(cid:3)%(cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:26)(cid:11)&(cid:11)(cid:3)’(cid:5)((cid:3))*+)(cid:3)\n(cid:28)(cid:17),(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:24)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:14)(cid:3)*-..#/)*+)(cid:3)\n0#*$1(cid:3)2##/.$))(cid:3)\n(cid:14)/(cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:12)3(cid:3) slipman@lipmankatzmckee.com(cid:3)\nrstolt@lipmankatzmckee.com(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n4(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:3)5(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:31)6(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:3)\n(cid:21)(cid:28)%(cid:3)&55(cid:25)7(cid:14)(cid:3)&5(cid:3)4(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:14)(cid:3)5(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:31)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:31)(cid:21)(cid:14)(cid:3)\n)*.(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:26)(cid:11)&(cid:11)(cid:3)’(cid:5)((cid:3))2*(cid:3)\n(cid:29)(cid:7)8(cid:23)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:14)(cid:3)*-9+./*)2*(cid:3)\n0#*$1(cid:3).2:/$$++(cid:3)\n(cid:14)/(cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:12)3(cid:3) dthistle@midmaine.com(cid:3) \n \nDavid M.

STOLT \n \n  I, Robert J. Stolt, first being duly sworn, do hereby depose and say as follows: \n  1.  I am an attorney in good standing in the State of Maine and in the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and a principal in the law firm of Lipman, Katz and McKee, P.A., 227 Water Street, \nAugusta, Maine 04330.  I am one of the attorneys for the Plaintiff above named and I am duly \nauthorized to execute this Affidavit. \n  2.  On July 8, 9 and 14, 2004, computer consultants retained by my firm, accompanied by \nKeith R. Varner, Esq. and Spencer Tracy, Legal Assistant, of my firm, obtained arrest, booking, \nhousing, release and other data for all detainees booked into the Knox County Jail from November 19, \n1996  through  June,  2004  from  computerized  records  maintained  by  the  Knox  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment.  Included in the electronic records obtained were databases used by the Knox County Jail \nand Knox County Sheriff in conjunction with proprietary law enforcement software manufactured by \nSpillman Technologies, Inc. (hereinafter \"Spillman\").  Also obtained were Microsoft Excel records and \nnumerous other computer files and records. \n3.  A complete copy of all records obtained has been provided by my office to Defendants' \nattorney, Peter T. Marchesi. \n  6\n\n4.  Since obtaining the electronic data, my office, including Keith Varner, Esq., Spencer \nTracy, other members of the firm's staff and me, in conjunction with our computer consultants, has \nworked diligently to organize, sort and transfer the data obtained into a Microsoft Access Database.  In \norganizing and transferring the data all of the original data fields and data tables have been preserved. \n5.

This includes comparing the Spillman data with data obtained earlier in discovery. This \nearlier discovery consists of Microsoft Excel apparently randomly saved by Corrections Sergeant \nCostigan.  The databases we are working with contain more than 300,000 lines of data.  Each line must \nbe individually examined to be either attached to the appropriate detainee or removed from the data \nset. \n7.  To date we have incurred expenses in excess of $63,000 in our effort to organize the \ndata into a coherent and useable form.  This amount does not include attorney and staff time. \n8.  The data and records maintained by the jail have several significant time period gaps.  \nAs an example, there are no paper or electronic records for March, June and July, 1997 or for August, \nSeptember, October, November and December 1998.

Await the outcome.  Give up \nUNTIL FURTHER  certain rights.  By doing nothing, you keep the \npossibility of getting money or benefits from a trial or a \nNOTICE \nsettlement of this case.  But, you give up any right to sue \nKnox County separately about the legal claims in this \ncase.  If this case settled, you will need to submit a timely \nclaim form.  You must keep class counsel informed if you \nchange your mailing address. \nASK TO BE  Get out of this lawsuit.  Get no benefits from it.  Keep \nEXCLUDED  rights.  If you ask to be excluded and money or benefits \nare later awarded, you won't share in those.  But, you keep \nyour rights to sue Knox County separately about the same \nlegal claims in this lawsuit.  To be excluded, your Notice \nof Exclusion must be received by the Claims \nAdministrator by ____________________, 20___. \n \nBASIC INFORMATION \n   \n1.  Why did I get this notice? \n \nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address during booking at the jail.  As part \nof the lawsuit, the County gave this booking information to the lawyers for the plaintiffs.  \nFrom this information, it appears that you may be a class member.  This is not an assurance \nthat you are a class member. \n \n2.  What is this case about? \n   \nThe plaintiffs claim that the Knox County Jail's strip search process is an illegal strip-search \nof people in the class.  A strip-search is a visual inspection or focused look at a person's \nnaked body.  Plaintiffs say that during the strip search, people being admitted to the Jail are \nroutinely strip searched by officers during the intake process.  The officers require people to \nexpose  their  body  cavities  and  to  squat  and  cough  to  expel  items  hidden  in  the  body.  \nPlaintiffs are seeking money damages for every person who was strip searched and a new \npolicy providing people with privacy while they change into a jail uniform. \n \n3.  What is Knox County's defense? \n \nKnox County defends the suit by denying any liability, and asserting that all searches that are \nthe subject of the suit were constitutionally conducted, and that no persons searched were \ndamaged by any such search. \n \n\n    Exh A to Mot4App \n4.  What is a class action? \n \nIn a class action, one or more people, called \"class representatives\", sue on behalf of other \npeople who have similar claims.  All of the people with claims are called plaintiffs.  Knox \nCounty, which is being sued, is the Defendant.  The court will resolve the common issues for \neveryone in the class.  The lawyers representing the class are called \"class counsel.\". \n \n5.  What are the requirements to be in the class? \n \nThe  Court  has  allowed  the  lawsuit  to  be  on  behalf  of  all  those  people  who,  between \nNovember 19, 1996 and December 31, 2004, were strip-searched at the Knox County Jail \nwhile waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested on charges \nthat did not involve a weapon or drugs or a violent felony. \n \n6.  What is a \"violent felony\"? \n \nThe term \"violent felony\" is a Class A or B crime involving the use, attempted use, or \nthreatened use of force, or a substantial risk that use of force may be used, to cause injury to \nanother person or property.  Examples of violent felonies include murder, manslaughter, \nrape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, robbery and arson. \n \n7.  Are all strip-searches in jail illegal? \n \nThere are times when correctional officers can legally strip-search a prisoner.  This case does \nnot  claim  that  all  strip-searches  at  the  jail  were  illegal.    Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  intake \nsearches of people who were held before a first court appearance were illegal.  This case does \nnot concern strip-searches for cause or on return from work release.  This case does not \nchallenge any strip-searches of convicted prisoners. \n \n8.  Is there any money available now? \n \nNo.  This case has not settled.  The Court has not decided whether the County did anything \nwrong. \n \n9.  How many people are there in this class action? \n \nLawyers for the plaintiffs estimate that there are several thousand persons eligible for class \nmembership. \n \n10.  Do I have a lawyer in this case? \n \n\n    Exh A to Mot4App \nThe Court has decided that attorneys Sumner Lipman and Robert Stolt of Lipman, Katz & \nMcKee, P.A., Post Office Box 1051, 227 Water Street, 2nd Floor, Augusta, Maine  04330, and \nDale Thistle of The Law Offices of Dale F. Thistle, 103 Main Street, Post Office Box 160, \nNewport, Maine  04953-0160, may represent all of the class members.  They are referred to \nas \"class counsel\".  They are experienced in handling civil rights cases. \n \nFor  more  information  on  these  lawyers,  you  can  view  their  firm  web  site  at:  \nwww.lipmankatzmckee.com. \n \n11.  Should I get my own lawyer? \n \nYou do not need to hire your own lawyer because class counsel is working on your behalf.  If \nyou want your own lawyer, you can hire one.  If you want to bring your own case, you must \nask to be excluded from the class action and file your own case.  To file a case, you should \nhire your own lawyer. \n \n12.  Why would I ask to be excluded? \n \nIf you want to bring your own case, you must ask to be excluded, also called \"opting out\" of \nthe class action. Then you will not receive any money or other benefits from this case.  \nHowever, you will not be legally bound by any judgment in this case.  If you plan to file your \nown lawsuit for the illegal strip-search, you should exclude yourself.  You will then need to \nretain a lawyer or enter a pro se appearance if you wish to assert your rights.  You should \nconsult a lawyer soon because once you are excluded, the statute of limitations will start to \nrun.  Your Notice of Exclusion should be sent to the Claims Administrator at Knox County \nClass  Action,  _____________________________.    It  must  be  received  by \n__________________, 200____. \n \n13.  How will the lawyers be paid? \n \nIf Class Counsel wins money or benefits for the class, they will ask the Court to approve \npayment  of  attorney's  fees  and  expenses.    If  the  Court  grants  this  request,  the  fees  and \nexpenses  will  either  be  deducted  from  the  settlement  fund  or  paid  separately  by  Knox \nCounty. \n \n14.  What happens next? \n \nThe plaintiffs will seek information from the County and the County will seek information \nabout the plaintiffs.  There could be a trial.  It is not known how long this will take.  Counsel \nwill need to contact you if there is a settlement or a trial.  It is important that you send a \nwritten  notice  of  any  change  of  address  to  Knox  County  Class  Action, \n\n    Exh A to Mot4App \n________________________________.  Please do not write to the Court directly.  You \nshould also inform the Post Office of your forwarding address. \n \n15.  What do I need to do in order to be part of this case? \n \nTo participate in this lawsuit, you do not have to do anything at this point except regularly \nreceive and read your mail.  If this case settles or a judgment is returned against the County, \nclass counsel will need to contact you and you will have to return a form within a set time \nperiod. \n \nIn order to ensure that you are able to participate in any settlement or judgment, you must \nmake sure that class counsel can reach you when it becomes necessary.  If your address or \ntelephone  number  changes,  you  must  let  the  Class  Administrator  know  this  by  sending \nwritten notice to:  Knox County Class Action, _______________________________.  Please \ndo not write to the Court directly. \n \n16.

Knox County, et al. Civil Action No. 02-251-P-C \n \nNOTICE OF CLASS ACTION \n \nA court authorized this notice.  This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \n•  You may be a member of a class action against Knox County.  The fact that you received this notice \nis not a guarantee that you are a member of the class.  This notice is to inform you of the case and \nyour legal rights. \n \n•  To be a class member you must meet all of the following requirements: \n \n•  Time:  You were arrested between November 19, 1996 and December 31, 2004. \n \n•  Type of custody:  You were held at the Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or \nfirst court appearance.  This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n \n•  Offense:  The underlying offense for which you were arrested did not involve a weapon or drugs, and \nwas not a violent felony. \n \n•  Search:  You were required to go through a strip search process which took place before you were \nplaced into a housing area or into a holding cell.  A strip search process is one in which you were \nrequired to remove your clothes and either squat, cough, open your mouth and expose your body \ncavity while a corrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body. \n \n•  Without cause:  If you were strip searched for cause, you are not in the class. An example of a strip-\nsearch for cause is a strip-search after a corrections officer finds drugs or a weapon in a person's \nclothing or has a reason to expect to find hidden contraband. \n \n•  Plaintiffs claim that the strip search process at the Knox County Jail is an unconstitutional strip-\nsearch.  Plaintiffs claim that corrections officers routinely viewed and inspected people's naked \nbodies without having a valid reason to do so.  A strip search process is one in which you were \nrequired to remove your clothes, and either squat, cough, open your mouth and expose your body \ncavity while a corrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body. \n \n•  Plaintiffs seek money damages from Defendant Knox County for the harm the strip searches caused \nto class members and a change in the practice. \n \n•  Knox County defends this suit by denying any liability, and asserting that all searches that are the \nsubject of the suit were constitutionally conducted, and that no persons searched were damaged by \nany such search. \n \n•  The Court has not yet decided whether Knox County did anything wrong. \n \nAny questions?

You are not a class member if you \nwere a  convicted prisoner serving a sentence, or if you were strip-searched for cause, for example after \nan officer discovered drugs or contraband in your possession. \n \nThe plaintiffs say that the jail's strips search procedure is an illegal strip-search because jail officers did \nnot have a valid reason for the search.  The case seeks money damages for the plaintiffs and new \npolicies to protect a detainee's privacy during intake. \n \nKnox County denies the allegations.  Knox County says that its officers did strip search detainees as a \nroutine matter.  The County says its officers were searching detainees' bodies for contraband.

Civil No. 02-251-P-C \n  \nKNOX COUNTY, DANIEL DAVEY, in his   \nindividual capacity and in his official capacity \nas Knox County Sheriff, and JANE DOE and \nJOHN DOE, in their individual capacities, \n  \n                               Defendants   \n \n \nGene Carter, Senior District Judge \n \nORDER APPROVING NOTICE TO CLASS \n \n  After considering the positions of the parties, the Court APPROVES that notice \nbe given to the class as proposed by Plaintiffs in their amended Proposed Notice to Class \nMembers (Docket Item No. 129) filed on August 16, 2005, except the language of the \nnotice be amended as described in the paragraphs below. \n  With respect to the document entitled “Your Legal Rights and Options in this \nLawsuit,” and designated as Exh A to Mot4App, the Court ORDERS that it state as \nfollows: \n2. What is this case about? \n \nThe plaintiffs claim that the Knox County Jail's strip search process is an illegal \nstrip-search of people in the class.  A strip-search is a visual inspection of a \nperson's naked body.  Plaintiffs say that during the strip search, people being \nadmitted to the Jail are routinely strip searched by officers during the intake \n\nprocess.  In some cases, the officers may have required people to expose their \nbody cavities or to squat and cough to expel items hidden in the body.  Plaintiffs \nare seeking money damages for every person who was strip searched and a new \npolicy providing people with privacy while they change into a jail uniform. \n \n6. What is a \"violent felony\"? \n \nThe term \"violent felony\" is a Class A, B or C crime involving the use, attempted \nuse, or threatened use, of force, or a substantial risk that use of force may be used, \nto cause injury to another person or property.  Examples of violent felonies \ninclude murder, manslaughter, rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, \nkidnapping, burglary, robbery and arson. \n \n7. Are all strip-searches in jail illegal? \n \nThere are times when correctional officers can legally strip-search a prisoner.  \nThis case does not claim that all strip-searches at the jail were illegal.  Plaintiffs \nclaim that the intake searches of people who were held before a first court \nappearance were illegal.  This case does not concern strip searches for any inmate \nwho is a convicted prisoner, or any inmate who has had the opportunity for \ncontact with a person outside of the jail facility after having been admitted to the \njail facility, or for any inmate who is returned to the jail from outside of the jail.  \n \n14. What happens next? \n \nThere could be a settlement or there could be a trial in the case.  It is not known \nhow long this will take.  Counsel will need to contact you if there is a settlement \nor a trial.  It is important that you send a written notice of any change of address \nto Knox County Class Action, ________________________________.  Please do \nnot write to the Court directly.  You should also inform the Post Office of your \nforwarding address. \n \nWith respect to the document entitled “Notice of Class Action,” and designated as Exh A \nto Mot4App, the Court ORDERS that the sixth bullet state as follows: \nSearch: You were required to go through a strip search process which took place \nbefore you were placed into a housing area or into a holding cell.  A strip search \nprocess is one in which you were required to remove your clothes while a \ncorrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body.  In some cases, the \nofficer may have required you to either squat, cough, and open your mouth or \nexpose your body cavity while a corrections officer inspected and viewed your \nnaked body. \n \n\nWith respect to the document entitled “Knox County Jail Strip-Search Lawsuit” and \ndesignated as ExhC2Mot4App, the Court ORDERS that it state as follows: \nYou may be a class member in a class action lawsuit which was certified by the \nFederal District Court of Maine on behalf of current and former detainees at the \nKnox County Jail if you meet ALL of the following conditions: \n \n(1) You were held at the Knox County Jail between November 19, 1996 \nand December 31, 2004; and \n(2) You were held in custody at the jail before a bail hearing or a first \ncourt appearance; \n(3) You were not arrested for crimes involving drugs or weapons, or a \nviolent felony; and \n(4) You were strip-searched without an evaluation to determine if there \nwas a reason to suspect possession of hidden contraband. \n \nA strip search process is one in which you were required to remove all of your \nclothes while a corrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body.  In \nsome cases, the officer may have required you to either squat, cough, and open \nyour mouth or expose your body cavity while a corrections officer inspected and \nviewed your naked body. \n \nYou are not a class member if you were a convicted prisoner serving a sentence, \nor if you were strip-searched for cause, for example after an officer discovered \ndrugs or contraband in your possession. \n \nIf you believe you are a class member, write to: \n \n \nExplain why you believe you are a class member.

SUMMARY  \n \n  The parties agreed to settle this case on Friday, September 29, 2006 at the Judicial \nSettlement Conference with Chief Judge Singal. (Docket Item No. 328). The general terms of the \nagreement are set forth in a Settlement Agreement signed by all parties on September 29, 2006.  \nAdditionally, the Court will issue an injunctive Order designed to prevent unconstitutional strip \nsearches in the future.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the parties are required to submit, using \nthe Second Amended Settlement Agreement approved in Nilsen v. York County, (02-CV-212-P-\nH) their final written agreement, along with a Motion to Recertify the Class on or before \nTuesday, October 3, 2006.  (Docket Item No. 318, supra). \n                                                 \n1  The parties continued to exchange communications as recently as the morning of \nOctober 10, 2006, in an effort to resolve all remaining issues with respect to the Final Settlement \nAgreement.  However, Plaintiff filed her own version of a Final Settlement Agreement.  \nAlthough the Defendants would have preferred to continue the dialog with Plaintiff in an effort \nto reach an agreement acceptable to all parties, the Defendants feel constrained to file the \nSettlement Agreement that they propose. \n \n1 \n\n \n  Pursuant to the Court’s October 4, 2006 “Remark” (Docket Item No. 334), the parties \nwill either jointly agree on language to be included in the injunctive Order, or will separately \nsubmit  proposed  orders  to  the  Court.  The  Agreement  also  settles  all  claims  of  the  class, \nincluding,  without  limitation  on  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  claims  of  the  class \nrepresentatives and absent class members who have not opted out for compensatory damages, \npunitive damages, attorneys fees and costs, and interest by establishing a common fund of Three \nMillion Dollars ($3,000,000.00), to be shared among participating class members after payment \nof attorneys fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and class representative bonuses.  Under \nthis Agreement, class members will receive one payment regardless of the number of times that \nthey were booked into the jail and searched during the class period.   \nII.  TERMS \nA.  Procedural History \n  1.  Plaintiff filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, \n2003, Judge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as follows: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search \nand/or  visual  body  cavity  search  without  evaluation  for  individualized \nreasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox County Jail: \n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve \na weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n2 \n\n \n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges \nthat did not involved a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(4)  after  having  been  arrested  on  a  warrant  that  did  not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony. \n \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. \n  2.  Plaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pre-trial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof  the  booking  procedure.    The  Defendants  have  denied  those  allegations  and  have \nasserted that both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and \nprocedures were at all times consistent with constitutional requirements.   \nB.  Agreement \n  1.  The parties agree that the class period begins on November 19, 1996, and ends \nDecember 31, 2004.   \n  2.  Knox County may agree to the issuance of an Injunctive Order issued by the \nCourt, and to any subsequent modifications to that Order. \n  3.  An approved class action notice was sent to potential class members at their \nlast known addresses and notices were published as required by the Court after class \ncertification. No class members asked to be excluded by the opt out deadline.   \n  4.  The Defendants will pay Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) to settle all \nclaims brought by Plaintiff and class in this action including claims for attorneys fees, \n \n3 \n\n \ncosts, administrative costs, and interest by check made out to the “Tardiff Settlement \nFund” and delivered to class counsel no later January 15, 2007. \n  5.  The parties agree and acknowledge that the Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole and that the payment was made and other agreements contained herein were given \nwithout admission of liability, which is expressly denied, and which payment was made \nand other agreements were given by the Defendants solely for the purpose of buying their \npeace and freedom from litigation.  No language contained in this Settlement Agreement \nor any language contained in any motions for approval of settlement filed by Plaintiffs or \nin any orders by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or final approval to \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  shall  in  any  way  be  construed  as  acknowledgments  or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by the Defendants. \n  6.  The Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nfacilitate the administration of this settlement including providing access to data and \ndocuments necessary to determine class membership if a person disputes denial of a \nclaim by the claims administrator. \n  7.  The Defendants understand that this agreement will require approval of the \nCourt.  The Defendants will ask the Court to approve the terms of the settlement. \n  8.  If Plaintiff has to incur any additional attorney time or costs to seek collection \nof the settlement fund because of a default by the Defendants in the timely performance \nof its obligations to pay under this Agreement, the Defendants may be responsible for \npayment of reasonable attorneys fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Any request for \n  4 \n\n \nsuch additional fees and costs shall be by application to the Court with opportunity for \nobjection by the Defendants. \n  9.    Class  counsel  will  establish  the  “Tardiff  Settlement  Fund”  as  a  qualified \nsettlement fund.  Once the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the entire fund \nand all interest or income resulting from the investment of the fund shall be part of the \nfund.  If the Defendants do not pay all or part of their obligation on time, the amount \nowed by that Defendant will accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year, \ncompounded daily.  Interest will only apply to the unpaid portion of the Defendant’s \nobligation. \n  10.  The Settlement Fund and any money earned by the fund will be invested in \nthe  Marshall  Money  Market  fund  which  is  AAA  rated  by  Fitch,  unless  and  until \notherwise ordered by the Court.  Class Counsel, Class Representatives, Defendants and \nDefense Counsel shall not have any responsibility or liability for the investment of the \nSettlement Fund.  If the Court does not give final approval to the settlement, the Plaintiffs \nwill return the amount paid to the Defendants. \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION \n  1.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders as \nappropriate to enforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and to \neffect fair and orderly administration. \n  2.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Settlement Agreement may be \nchanged by the Court on a showing of good cause. \n  5 \n\n \nIV.  HEARING \n  1.  The Court has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m., October 11, 2006, to decide \nwhether to grant approval to the settlement, recertify the class for settlement purposes and \nto issue a permanent Injunctive Order.  If approval is granted, the parties will begin to \nimplement  the  settlement.    The  Defendants  will  make  their  payment  as  specified \nhereinabove, and the Plaintiffs will send the approved notice to the class.   \n  2.  The Court will hold a final fairness hearing to decide whether to grant final \napproval of settlement on April 2, 2007.   \n  3.  If the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the Tardiff Settlement Fund \nwill belong to the Plaintiff and the class, and the Defendants will no longer have any right \nto, title to, or interest in the funds.  The funds will then be distributed pursuant to orders \nof the Court. \nV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR \n  1. Class counsel requests that the firm of Analytics, Inc. of Chanhassen, Minnesota \nto  be  approved  by  the  Court  as  Claims  Administrator.

The Claims Administrator will review each claim form to determine that the \nclaimant is a class member by confirming (a) that the Settlement Claim Form is timely \n  9 \n\n \nand valid, (b) that the information on the form is consistent with available booking data \npreviously provided by the Defendants, and (c) that the Form is completely filled out and \nsigned.   \n  2.  The Claims Administrator may, in its discretion, waive a technical defect in the \nClaim Form to achieve substantial justice. \n  3.  If the booking data indicates that the person does not meet the class definition, \nthe Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant.  The denial \nnotice will, if possible, indicate the reason or reasons for the denial.  These would include \n(a) not at the jail during the class period, (b) no booking for an offense within the class \ndefinition, or (c) that the person was not strip searched while being held awaiting bail or a \nfirst  court  appearance.    Because  the  booking  data  is  sometimes  inaccurate  or  non-\ndescriptive as to whether a person was strip searched, the Claims Administrator may \naccept the Claimant’s affirmation of strip search.   \n  4.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s determination that he or she is \nnot  a  class  member,  a  claimant  must  file  a  written  notice  of  appeal  to  the  Claims \nAdministrator postmarked no later than two (2) weeks after the date of the mailing on the \nNotice of Claim Denial.  He or she may include written documentation that shows that he \nor she is a class member, and he or she may also include a written statement.  Those \nobjections  claiming  that  a  person  who  otherwise  met  the  class  definition  were  strip \nsearched will be reviewed against available records of the Defendants to determine if the \nperson was strip searched.  The Claims Administrator will make a determination on each \n  10 \n\n \nappeal no later than eight (8) weeks after the deadline for class members to file such \nappeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in writing of their \ndetermination  and  will  provide  copies  to  all  counsel.    Rulings  by  the  Claims \nAdministrator will be final and binding, except that a Claimant is allowed to appeal a \ndenial of a claim directly to the Court. \n  5.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval (“Notice of \nClaim Approval”) to each approved claimant promptly but in no event later than one \nweek after the Court grants final approval of the settlement.   \n  6.  A claimant who used a different name at booking must present documentation \nestablishing that he or she is the person referred to in the booking records.  \nVIII.  EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS FEES \n  1.  Administrative costs, including the Claims Administrator’s fees and expenses, \nwill be paid from the Settlement Fund.   \n  2.  Class counsel ask the Court to approve payment of Plaintiff’s attorneys fees \nand out-of-pocket costs in the amount of thirty percent (30%) of the settlement fund.  \nThese fees and costs shall be paid at the same time as the distribution of the Settlement \nFund to class members.  In addition, class counsel will ask the Court to deduct from the \nsettlement an amount sufficient to pay the costs of further litigation and the expenses of \nclaims administration. \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS \n  1.  Class counsel recommends to the Court that the Claims Administrator pay \n  11 \n\n \nbonuses from the Settlement Fund to compensate the class representative for the time that \nshe  spent  on  this  case  and  her  loss  of  privacy  as  a  result  of  serving  as  a  Class \nRepresentative.  Class counsel also recommends a bonus to compensate the 19 class \nmembers whose depositions were taken by defense counsel for the time they spent.  Class \ncounsel recommends a bonus of $50,000.00 to Laurie Tardiff, the class representative.  \nClass counsel recommends a bonus of $500.00 to each of the 19 class members who were \ndeposed by the Defendants.  These checks will be issued at the same time as payments to \nclass members. \n  2.  Class members will receive payment from the common fund after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants. \n  3.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \nmember by providing one share for every class member with an approved claim.  The \nClaims  Administrator  will  total  the  number  of  approved  shares  and  then  divide  the \namount  remaining  in  the  Settlement  Fund  (after  the  payments  made  as  provided  in \nParagraph 2 above) by the number of shares to determine the amount each approved \nparticipating class member will receive. \n  4.  Class members will receive one payment even if they were booked into the jail \nand strip searched more than one time during the class period. \n  5.  Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \n  12 \n\n \nmember’s estate or the person filing an affidavit in compliance with the Maine Procedure \nfor  Collection  of  Personal  Property  by  Affidavit  of  the  Rightful  Heir  under  18-A \nM.R.S.A. § 3-1201, or the equivalent procedure of the law of another state that governs \nthe estate of the deceased class member.  A check will be mailed to the class member at \ntheir mailing address or it may be picked up.  Any change of address request must be \nmade in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n  6.    If  a  participating  class  member  is  confined  in  a  prison,  hospital  or  other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck  will  be  sent  to  that  address  unless  the  class  member  makes  other  acceptable \narrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator. \n  7.   Payments to class members are subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, or \nother legal process. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION \n  1. Marshall and Ilsley Bank, a nationally chartered bank, will prepare all Forms \n1099 for class members who receive a settlement check during the bank’s next regular \ntax-form processing following distribution.  The Claims Administrator will prepare all \nother necessary tax forms relating to the Settlement Fund account. \n  2.  The Claims Administrator will provide a report to the Court and to counsel for \nall parties accounting for the distribution of settlement funds, including attorneys fees and \nexpenses, once the distribution is complete. \n  3.    Any  balance  in  the  settlement  fund  after  all  settlement  checks  have  been \n  13 \n\n \ndistributed and all bonuses, expenses, and attorneys fees have been paid and will be \ndistributed under the Cy Pres  doctrine on order of the Court. \nXI.  DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS \n  1.    If  a  class  member  is  deceased,  an  authorized  representative  may  file  a \nSettlement Claim Form on behalf of the estate.  However, the representative must provide \nto  the  Claims  Administrator  documentation  that  an  estate  has  been  established  in \naccordance with the law and with Paragraph IX (5), above. \nXII.  RELEASE AND AGREEMENT TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD \nHARMLESS \n  1.  In consideration of the settlement amount, all Defendants, including individual \ndefendants  in  both  their  official  and  individual  capacities,  and  the  Maine  County \nCommissioners Association Self-Funded Risk Management Pool will be released from all \nliability for the class members’ claims for unlawful strip searches that were part of this \nlawsuit, including class members who do not file claims, except for any class members \nwho requested exclusion, opted out, and filed a claim within the applicable statute of \nlimitations.  The parties have expressly agreed that the release of claims arising from the \nsettlement includes all visual inspections, including without limitation visual body cavity \ninspections, that otherwise fall within the scope of the claims certified as a class action by \nthe Court in this case.  The parties further agree that this release of claims applies to any \nclaims that the strip searches were conducted in a manner that was unlawful, including \nwithout limitation, claims of physical touching, cross-gender searches, or searches which \n  14 \n\n \nwere observed by persons other than the correctional officer performing the search. The \nparties further agree that their settlement does not release any other claims, such as those \ninvolving physical touching, other than those alleged to have taken place in connection \nwith strip searches as aforesaid, or other types of alleged or wrongful conduct such as \nwrongful arrest, excessive force, or searches that were not part of the intake procedure \n(such as strip searches after a lockdown).   \n  2.    In  further  consideration  of  payment  of  the  settlement  amount,  each  class \nmember shall be obligated to satisfy all liens, subrogation interests or claims of any \ndoctor, hospital, insurance carrier, state or governmental agency, or any other person, \nfirm, or corporation, which have been made or may in the future be made against the \npayment to that class member described herein, or against any Defendant, arising out of \nthe claims, demands, actions or causes of action set forth in the First Amended Complaint \nand released as part of this Settlement Agreement.  Each class member further agrees to \nhold harmless and to defend and indemnify the Defendants, including their officers, \nofficials, employees, attorneys, agents, or any of them, to the fullest extent possible, from \nand  for  any  claims,  demands,  actions,  causes  of  action,  suits,  judgments,  costs  or \nexpenses of any kind, brought by that class member as a result of any search within the \nscope of this class action as certified by the Court in any orders approving this Settlement \nAgreement, whether or not the class member actually made a claim, except any class \nmember who opted out of the settlement. \n  15 \n\n \nXIII.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n \n  DISTRICT OF MAINE \n \n \n   \nDALE DARE, on behalf of himself and on \nbehalf of others similar situated, \n \n                               Plaintiffs   \n  \nv.                 Civil No. 02-251-P-C \n  \nKNOX COUNTY and DANIEL DAVEY, in   \nhis individual capacity and in his official \ncapacity as Knox County Sheriff, \n  \n                               Defendants   \n \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR  \nFINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT \n \n  After conducting the Final Fairness hearing on April 23, 2007, I now make the \nfollowing findings and orders: \n  1.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has provided notice to the class as ordered by the Court, \nand the class members have received proper notice of the settlement. \n  2.  The Third Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate, and provides notice of opt-out rights.  Therefore, final approval \nof the settlement as herein set forth is hereby GRANTED. \n  3.  It is hereby ORDERED that the distribution plan and opt-out notice, as \nprovided for in the Third Settlement Agreement are hereby APPROVED. \n  4.  I APPROVE and it is hereby ORDERED that the incentive award to \ncompensate the class representative, Dale Dare, in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars \n\n($5,000.00) and the payment of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) to each of the 20 \nmembers of the class who were deposed during discovery be made.  These payments \nshall be made at the same time as payments to class members. \n  5.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that class members receive payment from \nthe common fund after deducting the designated sum for attorneys’ fees, costs, and \nexpenses of administration, as finally authorized by the Court herein or by subsequent \norder, and payments to class members authorized in paragraph 4 above, and that the \nClaims Administrator calculate the amount due each class member by providing one (1) \nshare of the remaining amount of the fund to every class member whose claim is \napproved. \n  6.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ request that the Court \norder that a share of the fund be reserved for payment to former class member, Laurie \nTardiff, against the possibility that she may be found in separate litigation to be bound by \nthe Third Final Settlement Agreement is DENIED for reasons stated on the record at the \nFinal Hearing on April 23, 2007. \n  7.  I FIND that class counsel and the parties herein agreed in the Third Final \nSettlement (Docket Item No. 376) at 13 that “the Court . . . approve payment of \nPlaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and out-of-pocket costs in the amount of thirty percent (30%) \nof the settlement fund” and I FURTHER FIND that payment of counsel fees of twenty-\nfive percent (25%) of the fund is a fair and reasonable payment for such fees and costs \nusing the percentage of fund basis approved in this Circuit and District in such cases, In \nRe: Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 56 \nF. 3d 295, 305 (1st Cir. 1995); In Re: Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Anti-\n  2\n\nTrust Litigation, 216 F.R.D. 197, 216 (D. Me. 2003), having in mind the scope, difficulty \nand complexity of the work, the proficiency of counsel in performing it, and the result \nobtained by their efforts, all of which have been carefully considered by the Court.  The \nresulting fee award is substantially consistent with the fee rationale utilized and the result \nobtained thereby in respect to the fee award by Judge Hornby in the recent, basically \nidentical, case of Nilsen v. York County, 400 F. Supp. 2d 266 (D. Me. 2005), with which \nrationale this Court agrees and adopts for this case.  The Court notes that the resulting fee \naward substantially accords with counsel’s agreement in the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement that the thirty percent (30%) award would include both counsel fees of class \ncounsel and the expenses of litigation. \n  8.  Accordingly, it is FURTHER ORDERED that class counsel receive as \ncounsel fees herein the amount of Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000.00), \nor Twenty-Five percent (25%) of the amount of the settlement, and in addition thereto \nsuch part of the claimed expenses of One Hundred Seventy-Eight Thousand Five \nHundred Sixty-One Dollars ($178,561.00) as shall ultimately be approved as reasonable \nby the Court after further proceedings. \n  9.  The Court takes under ADVISEMENT class counsel’s claim for an award \nof litigation expenses. \n10.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that the costs claimed by the Claims \nAdministrator be paid out of the fund after their final approval by the Court. \n  11.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that each class member’s check be made \npayable only in the class member’s name, or upon the death of a class member, to the \npersonal representative of the deceased class member’s estate or the person filing an \n  3\n\naffidavit in compliance with the Maine Procedure for Collection of Personal Property by \nAffidavit of the Rightful Heir under 18-A M.R.S.A. § 3-1201, or the equivalent \nprocedure of the law of another state that governs the estate of the deceased class \nmember, such check to be mailed to the class member or other appropriate designee at \ntheir mailing address.  Any change of address request will be required to be made in \nwriting and must be signed by the claimant.  If a participating class member is confined \nin a prison, hospital, or other institution and has provided the address of such institution \nfor payment, the settlement check will be sent to that address unless the class member \nmakes other acceptable arrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator. \n  12.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that Marshall & Ilsley Bank, a nationally \nchartered bank, prepare all Forms 1099 for class members who receive a settlement check \nduring the bank’s next regular form-processing following distribution.  The Claims \nAdministrator will prepare all other necessary tax forms relating to the Settlement Fund \nAccount. \n  13.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that any balance in the Settlement Fund \nafter the settlement checks have been distributed, and all bonuses, expenses, and \nattorneys’ fees have been paid and will be distributed under the Cy Pres doctrine on order \nof the Court.  The parties understand that the Court shall have the discretion to order Cy \nPres distribution based upon the submissions by the class counsel in support of such \ndistribution. \n  14.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that, in consideration of the settlement \namount, all defendants, including individual defendants in both their official and \nindividual capacities, and the Maine County Commissioner’s Association’s self-funded \n  4\n\nRisk Management Pool be, and are hereby, RELEASED upon payment of a class \nmember’s approved share of the fund of and from all liability for the class member’s \nclaims for unlawful strip searches that were part of this lawsuit, including class members \nwho do not file claims, except for any class members who requested exclusion, opted out, \nand filed an individual lawsuit within the applicable statute of limitations; that the release \nof claims arising from this settlement includes all visual inspections, including without \nlimitation, visual body cavity inspections, that otherwise fall within the scope of the \nclaims certified as a class action by the Court in this case; that the release of claims \napplies to any claims that the strip searches were conducted in a manner that was \nunlawful, including without limitation, claims of physical touching, cross-gender \nsearches, or searches which were observed by persons other than the correctional officer \nperforming the search; and that their settlement does not release any other claims, such as \nwrongful arrest, excessive force, or searches that were not part of the admission process \n(such as strip searches after a lockdown). \n  15.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that each class member shall satisfy all \nliens, subrogation interests or claims of any doctor, hospital, insurance carrier, state or \ngovernmental agency, or any other person, firm, or corporation, which have been made or \nmay in the future be made against the payment to that class member described herein, or \nagainst any Defendant arising out of the claims, demands, actions, or causes of action set \nforth in the First Amended Complaint and released as part of this Settlement Agreement, \nand hold harmless and defend and indemnify the Defendants, including their officers, \nofficials, employees, attorneys, agents, or any of them, to the fullest extent possible, from \nand for any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, judgments, costs or \n  5\n\nexpenses of any kind brought by that class member as a result of any search within the \nscope of this class action and certified by the Court in any orders approving this \nSettlement Agreement, whether or not the class member actually made a claim, except \nany class member who opted out of the settlement. \n  16.   It is FURTHER ORDERED that the administration of the settlement \nshall comply with the following deadlines: \n  a.  Claimants who wish to appeal to the Court the Claims Administrator’s \nfinal decision shall file a Notice of Appeal with the Claims Administrator and \nwith the Court post-marked no later than fourteen (14) days after the date of the \nmailing of the appeal denial letter by the Claims Administrator. \n  b.  After receiving such notice of appeal, the Claims Administrator shall file a \nresponse with the Court within five (5) days after docketing of the notice of \nappeal to the Court. \n17.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that after all appeals have been finally \ndecided, the Claims Administrator shall promptly process all settlement claim forms to \ndetermine the amount of the share to be awarded to each successful claimant and \ndistribute settlement payments to class members pursuant to the distribution plan no later \nthan fourteen (14) days after the Court resolves all outstanding issues. \n18.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that the Claims Administrator will provide \nto the Court and to counsel for all parties a final accounting for the distribution of the \nSettlement Fund, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, within twenty (20) days from \nthe date of distribution. \n  6\n\n  19.  It is FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ counsel shall file a final \nreport of the settlement within sixty (60) days from receiving the Claims Administrator’s \naccounting and which shall seek approval of any disposition of any remaining funds. \n  SO ORDERED. \n \n            Gene Carter__________________________ \n            GENE CARTER \n            Senior United States District Judge \n \nDated at Portland, Maine this 24th day of April, 2007.   \n  7",

DEFENDANTS’ CLAIMS AGAINST LAURIE TARDIFF \n  The Defendants efforts to shoehorn Laurie Tardiff back into class membership is a \nnon-starter.  The Court heard extensive argument from all parties regarding a second opt \nout opportunity for all class members and Laurie Tardiff in particular. The Court \napproved a second opt out opportunity which seven (7) class members in addition to \nLaurie Tardiff elected to opt out.  To carve an exception to the opt out provision and \npreserve a place for Laurie Tardiff as a class member is unfair to those 366 people who \nfiled timely claims and to take away from those people any of the money that they can \n\nexpect to receive from this class settlement is unfair.  It is also unfair in its discriminatory \nimpact on Laurie Tardiff as a person who exercised her right to opt out of the class.   \n  B.  CORRECTIONS TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR FINAL \nSETTLEMENT APPROVAL \n  2.  Discovery and Electronic Data \n  The Defendant is correct that neither party served interrogatories on the other. \nPlaintiffs, however, served extensive and repetitive sets of document discovery requests \nand Requests for Admissions on the Defendants.  The discovery efforts in this case were \nastronomical and when Defendants did not comply, discovery conferences were held with \nMagistrate Judge Cohen and with the Court.  The latest tally on ECF filings stands at 390.   \n  The electronic information gathered on site was extensive and served as the sole \nmeans of verifying charge information for class members.  The five hard-bound books \n(Plaintiffs’ trial exhibits 3a through 3e) were distilled from the electronic data file. \nPlaintiffs complained vociferously about the jail’s poor record keeping with respect to \nidentifying individuals detained at the jail because of mistakes in birthdates, spelling, \nsocial security numbers and the like, but the database obtained through the recovery of \nelectronic records was priceless in its ability to provide information about crimes \ncommitted and to shed light on discrepancies between the respective positions of the \nparties as to when, how and under what circumstances individuals came to the jail.  The \nelectronic files became doubly valuable in sorting out the validity of claims made by \nclass members to the Claims Administrator.   \n  3.  The Paper Records \n\n  The Defendants are incorrect when they suggest that the paper records were used \nby the Claims Administrator for purposes of acting upon the claims by class members.  In \nfact, the records used were the electronic version of Plaintiffs’ trial exhibits 3a through e \nwere generated from the electronic database assembled by Plaintiffs’ computer experts \nfrom the on site recovery of electronic records at the jail. No reference was made to the \nintake release records for purposes of claims administration.   \n  The Defendants are incorrect when they suggest that available booking data is \nobtained exclusively from the paper records.  The booking data is not limited to paper \nintake and release records. There is extensive booking data in the electronic records \nwhich, cross-checked against Defendants “List of Objections”, made resolution of claims \neligibility decisions relatively easy. \n  Respectfully, Plaintiffs request that the Court approve settlement in this matter \nfinally.   \nDated:  April 20, 2007   /s/ Sumner Lipman  \n              Sumner Lipman, Esq. \n              Attorney for Plaintiffs \n              Lipman, Katz & McKee \n              227 Water Street, P.O.

Class Membership \n  Claims have been approved for 366 claimants out of a total of 423 timely filed \nclaim forms. An additional 14 claims were filed late and 8 individuals opted out.  Of the \n423 timely received claims, 366 were approved and 57 were rejected.  15 of the rejected \nclaimants stated on their claim forms that they were neither held nor strip searched.  The \nremainder were rejected because they were either serving a sentence or had been charged \nwith a disqualifying crime.   \n\n  67 claimants were found to be obligors owing child support arrearages from whom \nthe State will recoup approximately $350,000.00. \n  B.  The Fund \n  The Knox County Settlement Fund has been deposited in the Marshall Money \nMarket Fund as required by the Preliminary Settlement Approval Order.  It earns interest \nat the rate of 4.235% and has earned interest to date in the amount of $20,485.81.  The \nsettlement check from Knox County was received and deposited on the 14th day of \nFebruary, 2007 and the check from the Risk Pool was received and deposited on 16th day \nof February, 2007.  The projected interest to be earned through May 30, 2007 is estimated \nat $16,350.00 at which time the total estimated amount of the settlement fund available \navailable to be distributed by May 31, 2007 is $3,036,835.81.   \n  C.  Claims Administrator \n  Attached as Exhibit 1 to this Memorandum is the Affidavit of Becky L. \nOelschlager detailing the efforts made by the Claims Administrator getting notice to \npotential claimants and in approving and denying of claims.  Attached to that Affidavit \nare Exhibits A-G relating to publication of the claims notice and form.  Exhibit G  \nidentifies the 8 individuals who elected to opt out of the class settlement. \n  Also attached as Exhibit 2 to this Memorandum are bills dated April 13, 2007 \nfrom Analytics for services rendered between March 1, 2007 and April 13, 2007. And \nfinally, also attached as Exhibit 3 is Becky Oelschlager’s e-mail of April 12, 2007 \nestimating additional costs of $30,592.13 to close out the claims process.  Class counsel \n\nhad previously paid $8,684.33 to the Claims Administrator on its previous invoice (see \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees).  \n  D.  Class Members \n  Class counsel have fielded a multitude of phone calls from class claimants asking \nquestions about the claims process, final approval and payment and expressing their \ngratitude for the work done and the benefits obtained for class members. For many it was \nthe first time they had stood up to the plate.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Class counsel respectfully requests the Court approve the pending Motions as \nsubmitted. \nDated:  April 20, 2007   /s/ Sumner Lipman  \n              Sumner Lipman, Esq. \n              Attorney for Plaintiffs \n              Lipman, Katz & McKee \n              227 Water Street, P.O.

Civil No. 02-251-P-C \n   \nKNOX COUNTY, DANIEL DAVEY, in his   \nindividual capacity and in his official capacity \nas Knox County Sheriff, \n  \n                               Defendants   \n \nGene Carter, Senior District Judge \n \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF CLASS SETTLEMENT \n \n  This is a class action lawsuit over strip searches of arrestees at the Knox County \nJail.  The Court previously certified a class and the court of appeals affirmed the \ncertification.  Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332, (D.Me. 2003), aff’d, 365 F.3d 1, 7 \n(1st Cir. 2004).  The parties have now proposed for approval an agreement settling their \ndispute (Docket Item No. 351).  They request that the Court approve the settlement they \nhave proposed.   The Court held a hearing on this motion on October 24, 2006.1  The \n                                                 \n1   As a result of prior settlement negotiations of the parties in conference with Chief Judge Singal, \nthe class counsel filed on October 10, 2006 a proposed Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 339) \nwith a Motion Seeking Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 338).  The Defendants’ \ncounsel submitted on the same date its own version of a Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. \n342).  The Court held a conference/hearing with counsel and the parties on October 11, 2006 in open court, \nit appearing that there were significant variations in the two proposals.  The parties were left to resume \nnegotiations following the conference/hearing to see if a definitive proposed Settlement Agreement could \n\nCourt now indicates the conditions on which the Court will authorize, on subsequent \napplication of the parties, class-wide notice of a final settlement of the class action. \n  First, the Court notes that the agreement does not provide for a second \nopportunity for putative class members to request exclusion as permitted by Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(e)(3).  The decision whether to direct a second opportunity to opt \nout “is confided to the court’s discretion….  Many factors may influence the court’s \ndecision.  Among these are changes in the information available to class members since \nexpiration of the first opportunity to request exclusion, and the nature of the individual \nclass members’ claims.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(3), 2003 advisory committee’s note.  \nSeveral elements of the proposed settlement here counsel that putative class members \nhave a renewed opportunity to request exclusion from the class by opting out of it.  These \ninclude the breadth of the type of searches and actors covered by the settlement, thereby \nforeclosing further litigation by members of the class; the recent development that Laurie \nTardiff was replaced as class representative; Laurie Tardiff’s objection to the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement and contention that she is not bound by it; the Court’s prior \nindication that it would not approve a proposed “bonus” of Fifty Thousand Dollars \n($50,000.00) to be paid to Laurie Tardiff as provided for by the terms of the first \n                                                                                                                                                 \nbe arrived at by them.  See Transcript (Docket Item No. 357).  They subsequently filed the pending \nSettlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 351). \n \n  The situation in respect to settlement was further complicated by the position taken by the named \nclass representative, Laurie Tardiff, at the conference/hearing that she objected to the terms of the \nSettlement and wished to withdraw as class representative in the action.  The Court advised her to promptly \nconsult individual counsel and on October 13, 2006 new counsel entered an appearance on her behalf \n(Docket Item Nos. 346 and 349).  Since then, class counsel has filed a Motion to Strike Laurie Tardiff as \nClass Representative (Docket Item No. 350), which was subsequently withdrawn (Docket Item No. 354).  \nA Motion is now pending, filed by class counsel, to Substitute a party, Dale Dare, as Class Representative \n(Docket Item No. 355) and a Motion filed by Ms. Tardiff’s personal counsel to withdraw Ms. Tardiff as \nClass Representative (Docket Item No. 356). \n \n  The Court scheduled all these pending matters for further conference/hearing on October 24, 2006. \n \n  2\n\nproposed Settlement Agreements (Docket Item Nos. 339 and 342), see, Transcript, \nDocket Item No. 357 at 59-60; a controversy over the entry, timing and terms of the \nPermanent Injunction to be entered; the Parties’ preservation of a right of appeal of the \nsettlement if an injunction at variance with that proposed by the parties is entered; and the \nsettlement’s allocation of a recovery to each individual that does not vary by the number \nof times that individual was searched. \n  The Court will therefore refuse to approve the settlement (and will not direct \nclass-wide notice) unless a redrafted settlement agreement affords:  (1) a new opportunity \nfor exclusion from the class at the option of all putative class members, as provided for in \nRule 23(e)(3), and (2) resolution of the issues respecting the entry of injunctive relief by \nthe parties agreeing to the Court’s entry of its Amended Proposed Permanent Injunction, \nsee Docket Item No. 364.  The Court gives notice that it will not approve a settlement \nagreement that contains the language in the third sentence of ¶ II.B, “In the event that the \nCourt issues an injunctive order different than that proposed by the parties, the parties \nexpressly reserve the right to appeal the injunctive order and the Settlement Agreement of \nwhich it is an integral part, to the U.S. [sic] Circuit Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit,” (emphasis added), or language of effect equivalent to the emphasized phrase.  \nRather the Court will require for approval to be granted, that the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement provide specifically: \n“The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction, the \npurpose of which will be to ensure the Defendants’ compliance with \nFourth Amendment law governing strip searches.  The parties have agreed \non the terms of the injunction which are set forth in the Court’s Amended \nProposed Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 364), and all parties waive their rights to appeal the \nentry of, or terms of, this injunctive Order.” \n \n  3\n\nSee Court’s Amended Proposed Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement \nat 1 (Docket Item No. 364). \n  Otherwise, the Court finds that the notice that the parties have proposed amounts \nto “notice in a reasonable manner” as required by Rule 23(e)(1)(B).  If the parties file a \nThird Final Settlement Agreement that suitably addresses the foregoing concerns, the \nCourt will: \n(1)  Direct class-wide notice accordingly, provided that the notice is \nalso revised to explicitly include notice of the opportunity for, and \nthe deadline for, requesting exclusion from the class by opting out \nof it; \n \n(2)  Order that any motion for attorney’s fees and nontaxable costs \nshall be filed by such a time that the Rule 23(h)(1) notice of the fee \nrequest can be combined with the Rule 23(e) notice of settlement \nand be sent to the class at the same time; and \n     \n(3)  Order that counsel prepare a proposed Order to include other \nnecessary elements or actions necessary to completion and final \napproval of the class settlement, such as appointment of the class \nadministrator, deadlines for written objections and other interim \ndeadlines. \n \n  On filing of a Third Final Settlement Agreement and upon entry of the Court’s \nOrder Directing Class-Wide Notice, a hearing under Rule 23(e)(1)(c) will be scheduled \nby order of Court to take place on April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. on whether the settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate; whether any requests for attorney fees and nontaxable \ncosts should be allowed and, if so, the extent of such allowance; and resolution of any \nother issues then properly before the Court.  The Court will hear appropriate objections \non all those matters at that time.  See Rule 23(e)(4)(A), (h)(2),(h)(3). \n  The Court does not intend this order to be a preliminary fairness determination.  \nBecause a judicial determination of “preliminary fairness” unjustifiably suggests a \n  4\n\nheadwind against objections to the settlement agreement, the Court will, if the Third \nFinal Settlement Agreement is filed, determine whether the then proposed Third Final \nSettlement Agreement satisfies the Court’s requirements herein for approval of the \nsettlement, deserves consideration by the class and whether the notice is appropriate.  The \nCourt reserves all determinations of the proposed settlement’s fairness and \nreasonableness to its consideration of the relevant facts on the record after the April 23, \n2007 hearing. \n  The Court has this day granted Plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff’s Motion to Withdraw as \nClass Representative (Docket Item No. 356) and Plaintiff Class’s Motion to Substitute \nDale Dare as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 355).  Ms. Tardiff remains as a class \nmember.  The Court makes no decision and intimates no opinion as to her rights in this \nlitigation, whether she should remain a member of the class, or whether she is subject to \nbeing bound by any Settlement Agreement proposed herein or that may be finally \napproved by the Court.  Her rights and the rights of other parties in respect to all such \nmatters in this case are reserved for future determination, as may be sought by the parties.  \nThe Court’s ultimate resolution of any such issues so generated shall not be a basis for \nany party or class member to challenge, inter partes, the viability or enforceability of the  \nThird Final Settlement Agreement of the class action, if it is finally approved by the \nCourt. \n  It is ORDERED that counsel for the class and for the Defendants advise the \nClerk on or before November 3, 2006 if they will pursue the filing of a Third Final \nSettlement Agreement herein, and if they elect to do so, cause said document to be \ndocketed on or before November 14, 2006, in default of either event the case will be set \n  5\n\nfor jury selection and trial on the remaining two liability issues only by further order of \nCourt. \n              /s/Gene Carter________________ \n              GENE CARTER \n              Senior United States District Judge \n \nDated at Portland, Maine this 24th day of October, 2006. \n  6",

Civil Action ## 02-251-P-C I have asked Bob \nto change it and he has said -I will not do this· \nMy damages far exceed what is being requested for the emotional damages alone in this \nsuit for the last 5.5 years. They not only stripped me, touched my breasts and did a cavity search as \nwell. This took place when there were male guards and inmates walking by during my strip search. \nPlease see exhibit A for more specific damages as well. \nI have asked that Bob change this settlement form to $500.000.00 for me. I also have \nrequested that he keep the decertification and I could go individually as well.  My damages are \nendless, not to mention the ongOing therapy I will need for long term emotional healing after this \ncase. The $50,000.00 does not begin to cover it.  I do realize the $50.000.00 payout is for being the \nclass rep, but I am unlcear as to me signing off completely when my personal damages far exceed \nthis amount. I am prepared to have ajury trial to determine these damages. Please see a letter \nattached for my prosposed damages as well. I realize this case is simular to Neilson vs York, \nhowever this has been 5.5 years of my life.  When I originally signed the contract with attorneys \nthey were all representing me alone, not a class. \nI would like to say that I am not in agreement of the settlement letter on Sept 29th when I \nmet with the defense attorneys and plantiffs attorneys with Judge Singal. I initially signed this off \nbut with an assumption that my 19a1 reps would make sure that part of that settlement would cover \nmy damages. At this time I am not signing off in this settlement until there is an agreement in \nplace for my monetary damages individually as well as the class representative. I am asking that I \nhave a conferece with you Judge Carter and Judge Singal in private chambers. Is this possible1 My \nnumber is 354-8184 or pager 207-851-5323. \nMy attorneys in this suit have refused to speak with me since Wed Oct 4th. I have asked for \na meeting with them as well and also sent them an e-mail explaining that I want to weigh my \noptions to perhaps opt out of the class and pursue this individually since we have already won \nsummary judgement in my time frame.

SUMMARY  \n \n  The parties agreed to settle this case on Friday, September 29, 2006 at the Judicial \nSettlement Conference with Chief Judge Singal.  This case has been in litigation for four \nyears. It has been to the First Circuit Court of Appeals where the Court’s Certification \nOrder  of  November  5,  2003  was  upheld  and  then  through  extensive  discovery \nculminating in partial Summary Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff on issues of liability. \nIn April of 2005, the Court rolled back the Summary Judgment Order to leave the issue \nopen with respect to custom and practice allegations relating to strip searches conducted \nby  the  County  during  the  period  September  1,  2002  through  December  31,  2004, \ninadequate training of guards throughout the entire class period, November 19, 1996 \nthrough  December  31,  2004  and  supervisory  responsibility  of  Sheriff  Davey  for  the \n \n1 \n\n \nperiod September 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004. \n  On September 19, 2006, the Court rebifurcated issues of liability and damages and \nthen decertified the class for purposes of determining damages through individual trials.  \nIn  the  light  of  the  complications  decertification  posed  for  trial  including  inordinate \nexpense, time and risk to both parties, the parties agreed to a settlement conference with \nChief Judge Singal on Friday, September 29, 2006.  That settlement resulted in five point \nagreement wherein the Defendants will pay three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) to the \ncase  settlement  fund;  Plaintiffs  agree  to  a  30%  legal  fee  including  out-of-pocket \ndisbursements to be paid out of the fund; the parties will file a Joint Motion for Class \nRecertification only for purposes of facilitating settlement and disbursing the balance of \nthe settlement fund to qualifying class members; the Court will issue an injunction and, \nthe parties will submit, using the Second Amended Settlement Agreement approved in \nNilsen  v.  York  County,  (02-CV-212-P-H)  their  final  written  Settlement  Agreement.  \n(Docket Item No. 318, supra). \n  Pursuant to the Court’s October 4, 2006 “Remark” (Docket Item No. 334), the \nparties will either jointly agree on language to be included in the injunctive Order, or will \nseparately submit proposed orders to the Court. \nThe Agreement also settles all claims of the class, including, without limitation on \nthe generality of the foregoing, claims of the class representatives and absent class \n \n2 \n\n \nmembers who have not opted out for compensatory damages, punitive damages, \nattorneys fees and costs, and interest by establishing a common fund of Three Million \nDollars ($3,000,000.00), to be shared among participating class members after payment \nof attorneys fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and class representative bonuses.  \nUnder this Agreement, class members will receive one payment regardless of the number \nof times that they were booked into the jail and searched during the class period.   \nII.  TERMS\nA.  Procedural History\n  1.  Plaintiff filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, \n2003, Judge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as follows: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search \nand/or  visual  body  cavity  search  without  evaluation  for  individualized \nreasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox County Jail: \n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve \na weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges \nthat did not involved a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(4)  after  having  been  arrested  on  a  warrant  that  did  not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony. \n \n \n3 \n\n \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. \n  2.  Plaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pre-trial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof  the  booking  procedure.    The  Defendants  have  denied  those  allegations  and  have \nasserted that both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and \nprocedures were at all times consistent with constitutional requirements.   \nB.  Agreement \n  1.  The parties agree that the class period begins on November 19, 1996, and ends \nDecember 31, 2004.   \n  2.  Knox County agrees that it will adhere to the permanent Injunctive Order \nissued by the Court, and to any subsequent modifications to that Order. \n  3.  An approved class action notice was sent to potential class members at their \nlast known addresses and notices were published as required by the Court after class \ncertification. No class members asked to be excluded by the opt out deadline.   \n  4.  The Defendants will pay Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) to settle all \nclaims brought by Plaintiff and class in this action including claims for attorneys’ fees, \ncosts, administrative costs, and interest by check made out to the “Tardiff Settlement \nFund” and delivered to class counsel no later than November 15, 2006.  Defendants agree \nto pay interest at the current money market rate of 4.55% compounded daily for each day \nit fails to make payment after November 15, 2006.  If Defendants fail to make payment \n  4 \n\n \non or after January 15, 2007, they will pay interest at the rate stated in Paragraph 9, infra.   \n  5.  The parties agree and acknowledge that the Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole and that the payment was made and other agreements contained herein were given \nwithout admission of liability, which is expressly denied, and which payment was made \nand other agreements were given by the Defendants solely for the purpose of buying their \npeace and freedom from litigation.  No language contained in this Settlement Agreement \nor any language contained in any motions for approval of settlement filed by Plaintiffs or \nin any orders by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or final approval to \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  shall  in  any  way  be  construed  as  acknowledgments  or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by the Defendants. \n  6.  The Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nfacilitate the administration of this settlement including providing access to data and \ndocuments necessary to determine class membership if a person disputes denial of a \nclaim by the claims administrator. \n  7.  The Defendants understand that this agreement will require approval of the \nCourt.  The Defendants will ask the Court to approve the terms of the settlement. \n  8.  If Plaintiff has to incur any additional attorney time or costs to seek collection \nof the settlement fund because of a default by the Defendants in the timely performance \nof its obligations to pay under this Agreement, the Defendants may be responsible for \npayment of reasonable attorneys fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Any request for \nsuch additional fees and costs shall be by application to the Court with opportunity for \n  5 \n\n \nobjection by the Defendants. \n  9.    Class  counsel  will  establish  the  “Tardiff  Settlement  Fund”  as  a  qualified \nsettlement fund.  Once the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the entire fund \nand all interest or income resulting from the investment of the fund shall be part of the \nfund.  If the Defendants do not pay all or part of their obligation on time, the amount \nowed by that Defendant will accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year, \ncompounded daily.  Interest will only apply to the unpaid portion of the Defendant’s \nobligation. \n  10.  The Settlement Fund and any money earned by the fund will be invested in \nthe  Marshall  Money  Market  fund  which  is  AAA  rated  by  Fitch,  unless  and  until \notherwise ordered by the Court.  Class Counsel, Class Representatives, Defendants and \nDefense Counsel shall not have any responsibility or liability for the investment of the \nSettlement Fund.  If the Court does not give final approval to the settlement, the Plaintiffs \nwill return the amount paid to the Defendants. \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION\n  1.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders as \nappropriate to enforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and to \neffect fair and orderly administration. \n  2.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Settlement Agreement may be \nchanged by the Court on a showing of good cause. \n  6 \n\n \nIV.  HEARING\n  1.  The Court has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m., October 11, 2006, to decide \nwhether to grant approval to the settlement, recertify the class for settlement purposes and \nto issue a permanent Injunctive Order.  If approval is granted, the parties will begin to \nimplement  the  settlement.    The  Defendants  will  make  their  payment  as  specified \nhereinabove, and the Plaintiffs will send the approved notice to the class.   \n  2.  The Court will hold a final fairness hearing to decide whether to grant final \napproval of settlement on April 2, 2007.   \n  3.  If the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the Tardiff Settlement Fund \nwill belong to the Plaintiff and the class, and the Defendants will no longer have any right \nto, title to, or interest in the funds.  The funds will then be distributed pursuant to orders \nof the Court. \nV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR\n  1. Class counsel requests that the firm of Analytics, Inc. of Chanhassen, Minnesota \nto  be  approved  by  the  Court  as  Claims  Administrator.    The  Declaration  of  Richard \nSimmons and the qualifications of Analytics, Inc. are attached hereto as Exhibit E. \n  2.    Class  counsel  recommends  that  the  Claims  Administrator  be  permitted  to \ndesignate an attorney as agent in Knox County to distribute checks to any claimants who \nwish to pick up their check.  This agent will be paid by the Claims Administrator for \nperforming this service. \n  3.    The  Claims  Administrator  will  administer  notice  to  class  members  in  the \n  7 \n\n \nmanner prescribed by the Court; shall accept and docket all claims; shall send all notices \nthat a claim has been accepted or rejected to class members; shall resolve any appeals of \nclaim denials; shall calculate the amount of each claim pursuant to the formula set out in \nthis Agreement; and shall report to the Court as necessary, including providing a final \nreport. \n  4.  Class counsel will oversee settlement administration and will provide direction \nto the Claims Administrator as needed. \nVI.  NOTICE, OBJECTIONS, AND CLAIM\n  1.  Class counsel will send a Notice of Class Action Settlement and of the Hearing \nto Approve the Settlement (“Notice of Settlement”), a Settlement Claim Form, and a \nFrequently Asked Questions sheet, by first class mail postage prepaid to all potential \nclass members, whose addresses are known to class counsel, at their last known address \nwithin three weeks after the Court’s order granting preliminary approval.  If any mail is \nreturned by the post office with notice of a more current address, class counsel will \nresend the notice to that address.  Class counsel is not required to make any further \nefforts to send mail directly to class members.  A Notice of Settlement and Settlement \nClaim Form will be made available to anyone who requests such information.  Claim \nForms will be available to be downloaded from the web site or on request to the Claims \nAdministrator including through a toll free number. \n  2.  The Notice of Settlement will include the terms of the settlement (attached as \nExhibit A) and the class member’s right to contest the settlement.  This Notice includes \n  8 \n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions which explain the settlement terms and answer anticipated \nquestions.  Attached as Exhibit F is the envelope to be used for mailing the proposed \nNotice of Settlement.   \n  3.  The Settlement Claim Form requests the class member’s contact information, \naffirmation that he or she meets the class definition, instructions for check delivery, and a \nForm W-9.  The proposed settlement claim form is attached as Exhibit B. \n  4.  Class counsel will also publish notice of the settlement in the Portland Press \nHerald, Rockland Courier Gazette and the Bangor Daily News.  This notice is attached as \nExhibit C.  The Defendant agrees to post the notice for publication attached as Exhibit C \nin the intake/booking area as well as in one area frequented by inmates in each of the \nseparate pods at the jail.  The notices will be posted as soon as the Court approves the \nmailing of a class wide notice of proposed settlement attached as Exhibit A, and will \nremain up until the last day that the settlement claim forms can be filed.  In addition, the \nDefendant has agreed to make available during the same timeframe defined in the prior \nsentence,  to  inmates  (or  anyone  else)  who  requests  it,  a  copy  of  the  Notice  of  the \nSettlement attached as Exhibit A and counsel for the class will provide the County with \n500 copies.   \n  5.    In  addition  to  the  legal  notices,  class  counsel  will  issue  a  press  release \ninforming the public of the settlement.  The press release is attached as Exhibit D. \n  6.    Class  counsel,  through  the  Claims  Administrator,  will  establish  a  website \n(www.knoxcountyjailclass.com) which will include the Notice of Settlement (Exhibit A) \n  9 \n\n \nand the Settlement Claim Form (Exhibit B).   \n  7.  The Claims Administrator will send a claim form to anyone who requests one \nbefore the time for filing claim forms has expired.  In addition, the Claims Administrator \nwill maintain updated documents regarding this settlement on the website including a \nclaim  form  which  can  be  printed  and  mailed.  The  Claims  Administrator  will  also \nmaintain a toll-free number for claimants to call with questions about the claim form. \nThis number will be operational for at least five (5) months. \n  8.  In order for a class member to claim a share of the settlement, he or she must \nsubmit a valid and complete Settlement Claim Form postmarked no later than  January 5, \n2007.  This deadline is called the “Claims Deadline”. \n  9.  In order for a class member to object to the proposed settlement, he or she must \nsubmit written notice of the objection to the Claims Administrator.  In addition, an \nobjector may also appear in person or through counsel at the final fairness hearing when \nthe objection will be considered by the Court.  The Claims Administrator will forward all \nletters of objection to the Court and to counsel for all parties.  (The class member may \nalso submit a Settlement Claim Form if he or she wishes to be eligible to share in the \nsettlement should it be approved despite his or her objection.) \n  10.  Settlement Claim Forms received by the Claims Administrator within two \nweeks after the Claims Deadline will be treated as if postmarked by the Claims Deadline.  \nThis two-week grace is the Amnesty Period. \n  11.  Notwithstanding paragraph 10 above, claim forms will be treated as filed in a \n  10 \n\n \ntimely manner if either (1) the form is received by the Claims Administrator by no later \nthan January 5, 2007, or (2) if a request to permit additional time to file a claim form is \nreceived by the Court by no later than January 5, 2007 and the related claim form is \nreceived by the Claims Administrator by no later than January 19, 2007. Claim forms \nreceived after this date will be denied as untimely. \nVII.  APPROVALS AND APPEALS\n  1.  The Claims Administrator will review each claim form to determine that the \nclaimant is a class member by confirming (a) that the Settlement Claim Form is timely \nand valid, (b) that the information on the form is consistent with available booking data \npreviously provided by the Defendants, and (c) that the Form is completely filled out and \nsigned.   \n  2.  The Claims Administrator may, in its discretion, waive a technical defect in the \nClaim Form to achieve substantial justice. \n  3.  If the booking data indicates that the person does not meet the class definition, \nthe Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant.  The denial \nnotice will, if possible, indicate the reason or reasons for the denial.  These would include \n(a) not at the jail during the class period, (b) no booking for an offense within the class \ndefinition, or (c) that the person was not strip searched while being held awaiting bail or a \nfirst  court  appearance.    Because  the  booking  data  is  sometimes  inaccurate  or  non-\ndescriptive as to whether a person was strip searched, the Claims Administrator may \naccept the Claimant’s affirmation of strip search.   \n  11 \n\n \n  4.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s determination that he or she is \nnot  a  class  member,  a  claimant  must  file  a  written  notice  of  appeal  to  the  Claims \nAdministrator postmarked no later than two (2) weeks after the date of the mailing on the \nNotice of Claim Denial.  He or she may include written documentation that shows that he \nor she is a class member, and he or she may also include a written statement.  Those \nobjections  claiming  that  a  person  who  otherwise  met  the  class  definition  were  strip \nsearched will be reviewed against available records of the Defendants to determine if the \nperson was strip searched.  The Claims Administrator will make a determination on each \nappeal no later than eight (8) weeks after the deadline for class members to file such \nappeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in writing of their \ndetermination  and  will  provide  copies  to  all  counsel.    Rulings  by  the  Claims \nAdministrator will be final and binding, except that a Claimant is allowed to appeal a \ndenial of a claim directly to the Court. \n  5.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval (“Notice of \nClaim Approval”) to each approved claimant promptly but in no event later than one \nweek after the Court grants final approval of the settlement.   \n  6.  A claimant who used a different name at booking must present documentation \nestablishing that he or she is the person referred to in the booking records.  \n \nVIII.  EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS FEES\n  1.  Administrative costs, including the Claims Administrator’s fees and expenses, \n  12 \n\n \nwill be paid from the Settlement Fund.   \n  2.  Class counsel ask the Court to approve payment of Plaintiff’s attorneys fees \nand out-of-pocket costs in the amount of thirty percent (30%) of the settlement fund.  \nThese fees and costs shall be paid at the same time as the distribution of the Settlement \nFund to class members.  In addition, class counsel will ask the Court to deduct from the \nsettlement an amount sufficient to pay the costs of further litigation and the expenses of \nclaims administration. \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS\n  1.  Class counsel recommends to the Court that the Claims Administrator pay \nbonuses from the Settlement Fund to compensate the class representative for the time that \nshe  spent  on  this  case  and  her  loss  of  privacy  as  a  result  of  serving  as  a  Class \nRepresentative.  Class counsel also recommends a bonus to compensate the 19 class \nmembers whose depositions were taken by defense counsel for the time they spent.  Class \ncounsel recommends a bonus of $50,000.00 to Laurie Tardiff, the class representative.  \nClass counsel recommends a bonus of $500.00 to each of the 19 class members who were \ndeposed by the Defendants.  These checks will be issued at the same time as payments to \nclass members. \n  2.  Class members will receive payment from the common fund after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants. \n  3.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \n  13 \n\n \nmember by providing one share for every class member with an approved claim.  The \nClaims  Administrator  will  total  the  number  of  approved  shares  and  then  divide  the \namount  remaining  in  the  Settlement  Fund  (after  the  payments  made  as  provided  in \nParagraph 2 above) by the number of shares to determine the amount each approved \nparticipating class member will receive. \n  4.  Class members will receive one payment even if they were booked into the jail \nand strip searched more than one time during the class period. \n  5.  Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \nmember’s estate or the person filing an affidavit in compliance with the Maine Procedure \nfor  Collection  of  Personal  Property  by  Affidavit  of  the  Rightful  Heir  under  18-A \nM.R.S.A. § 3-1201, or the equivalent procedure of the law of another state that governs \nthe estate of the deceased class member.  A check will be mailed to the class member at \ntheir mailing address or it may be picked up.  Any change of address request must be \nmade in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n  6.    If  a  participating  class  member  is  confined  in  a  prison,  hospital  or  other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck  will  be  sent  to  that  address  unless  the  class  member  makes  other  acceptable \narrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION\n  1. Marshall and Ilsley Bank, a nationally chartered bank, will prepare all Forms \n  14 \n\n \n1099 for class members who receive a settlement check during the bank’s next regular \ntax-form processing following distribution.  The Claims Administrator will prepare all \nother necessary tax forms relating to the Settlement Fund account. \n  2.  The Claims Administrator will provide a report to the Court and to counsel for \nall parties accounting for the distribution of settlement funds, including attorneys fees and \nexpenses, once the distribution is complete. \n  3.    Any  balance  in  the  settlement  fund  after  all  settlement  checks  have  been \ndistributed and all bonuses, expenses, and attorneys fees have been paid and will be \ndistributed under the Cy Pres  doctrine on order of the Court. \nXI.  DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS\n  1.    If  a  class  member  is  deceased,  an  authorized  representative  may  file  a \nSettlement Claim Form on behalf of the estate.  However, the representative must provide \nto  the  Claims  Administrator  documentation  that  an  estate  has  been  established  in \naccordance with the law and with Paragraph IX (5), above. \nXII.

Knox County Civil Action No. 02-251-PH \n \nYou could get a payment from a $3 million dollar class \naction settlement if you meet all of the following conditions: \n \n  1.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December \n31, 2004 \n \n  2.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first \ncourt appearance.  This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n \n  3.  You were not charged with a crime involving drugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \n  4.  You were strip searched without evaluation to determine if there was a reason to  \n    Suspect possession of hidden contraband. \n \nA federal Court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \n•  A $3 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about alleged illegal strip \nsearches that took place when people were strip searched at the Knox County Jail while \nbeing held prior to trial. \n \n•  The settlement fund will pay cash to those who submit valid claims after deducting attorney’s \nfees, and the costs and expenses for this case. \n \n•  The settlement prohibits the Knox County Jail from continuing the policy, custom and \npractice of strip searching people held prior to trial, charged with crimes not involving drugs, \nweapons or a violent felony. \n \n  Your legal rights are affected if you act or do not act. Please Read this Notice Carefully \n \nYou are receiving this notice because records show that you may be a class member. To see if you \nqualify, you must submit a complete Settlement Claim Form, postmarked by January 5, 2007, to:  \n                 \n    Tardiff Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2006, Chanhassen, MN 55317-2006 \n \nIf you submit a claim form and qualify as a class member, you will share in this settlement. The amount \nof money you will receive depends on how many people submit claim forms. The money will be divided \nby the number of claims. Lawyers for the plaintiffs believe that over seven thousand people are eligible \nmembers of the Class.  \n \n \nTHESE ARE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT:  \nSubmit a Claim Form   This is the only way to get a payment. Remember: Claim Forms \npostmarked after January 5, 2007 will not be considered for payment. \nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n1\n\nObject  You must write to the Court explaining why you believe the settlement is not \nfair by January 19, 2007. Second, you must appear in Court at the Fairness \nHearing on April 2, 2007.  Third, you must also submit a claim form. \nDo Nothing  You get no payment. You will still be bound by the settlement and you give \nup your right to sue the defendant on these claims later. \n \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS – WHAT YOU GET AND HOW TO GET IT \n \nHow much will my payment be? \n \nWe do not know the amount of the payments. If you are eligible you will get a payment for only one \nstrip search. The amount will depend on how many people submit claim forms.  The amount per person \nwill decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. Each participating person will receive an \nequal amount. \n \nThe settlement money will be distributed after payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses and bonuses. \nCounsel requests a 30% attorney’s fee, which includes all costs, expenses and disbursements.  Class \ncounsel requests payment of a bonus to the class representative and class members who were deposed to \ncompensate them for the time they spent helping to bring about this settlement and for the loss of \nprivacy to the class representative. The requested bonuses range from $500.00 for participating in a \ndeposition to $50,000.00 for serving as class representative. The total amount of the requested bonuses \nis $59,500.00, less than 2% of the total settlement. \n \nHow can I get a payment? \n \nYou must fill out the Settlement Claim Form completely and mail it to the Claims Administrator. A \nClaim Form is included with this notice. You can also obtain a Claim Form from the Settlement Website \nat www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. The envelope must be postmarked no later than January 5, 2007; \nif it is not, your claim will be denied.  \n \nThe settlement check will be written in your name with your social security number. Your check will be \nsent to your mailing address. If you move, you must notify the Claims Administrator in writing of your \nnew address or the check will be sent to your old address. \n \nWhen will I get my payment? \n \nYou cannot be paid until the settlement is approved by the Court and any appeals are over. The Court \nwill hold a hearing on April 2, 2007, to decide whether to approve the settlement.  If the Court approves \nthe settlement and all appeals are completed promptly, you should receive your settlement check by June \n1, 2007, unless there are any unforeseen delays.  \n \nWill I have to pay taxes on my payment? \n \nYou may have to pay taxes on your payment. You should consult your tax preparer when you file your \ntax returns. The Claims Administrator will send you a 1099 Form. (If you have questions about backup \nwithholding, Form W-9 or Form 1099, call your tax preparer or the IRS Information Reporting Program \nCustomer Service Section, toll free at (866) 455-7438, 8:30 am to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.) \n \nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n2\n\n \nWhat should I do if I do not want to participate in the class action? \n \nIf you do not wish to participate in the class action, do nothing.  If you do not send in a claim form you \nwill not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment. You will also be barred \nfrom filing a case on these claims in the future. \n \nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT \n \nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\n \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Laurie Tardiff), sued on \nbehalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of the people who were similarly treated are known as \nthe Class or Class Members.  One court resolves the issues for all Class Members.   \n \nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the settlement?\n \nThe Court has ruled that you are a Class Member if you meet all four factors below: \n \n1.   You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December 31, 2004. \n2.   You were held at Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first court \nappearance. This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n3.   You were not charged with a crime involving drugs or weapons or a violent felony. \n4.   You were strip searched before a first court appearance or while awaiting bail. \n \nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip searched while you were serving a \nsentence, (2) you were strip searched after an evaluation which determined there was reason to suspect \npossession of hidden contraband., or (3) you were arrested for and/or charged with a crime involving \ndrugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \nWhat crimes are considered to be violent felonies?\n \nThe following crimes are violent felonies: aggravated assault, arson, assault on an officer, criminal \nrestraint, elevated aggravated assault, gross sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, murder, rape, and \nrobbery. This list is non-exclusive, and other felony level crimes may be determined to be “violent”. \n \nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime? \n \nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership. If any one of the charges \nwas a crime involving weapons or drugs or was a violent felony, you are not a class member for that \narrest. You might be eligible for another arrest. \n \nWhat if I was arrested on a default warrant of violation of probation or parole? \n   \nYou are a class member if you were arrested on a default or other warrant or for violating the terms of \nprobation or parole so long as the crime for which you were on probation did not involve weapons, or \ndrugs, or a violent felony. \n3\nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n\n \nWho makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member? \n \nThe Class Administrator makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member subject to \nCourt review. The booking records kept by the Knox County Jail will help determine if you are a class \nmember. You can help by listing the date or dates when you feel you met the class definition.  If the \nrecords do not show that you fit the class definition, your claim will be denied. You can appeal your \ndenial to the claims administrator by sending documentation and information regarding the dates you \nbelieve you were held and strip searched.  A decision by the Claims Administrator can be appealed to \nthe Judge.  (If you are not a class member, you are not bound by this settlement. You can take action as \nan individual if you wish.) \n \nWhat if I was arrested and strip searched more than once, can I still participate? \n \nYes. If you were arrested and brought to the Jail more than once during the class period you are a \nmember of the class and can recover money. You can only recover one payment, however, as you will \nnot be provided with extra payments if you were arrested and strip searched at the jail more than one \ntime. \n \nWhat if I was at the jail on or before November 18, 1996 or after December 31, 2004?\n \nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be filed \nwithin a certain time period; this is called the statute of limitations.  The law in Maine only allows a \nperson to bring a claim within six years after his or her rights were violated.  Because this case was filed \nby Laurie Tardiff on or about November 19, 2002, class members include anyone strip-searched in the \nsix years before that date.  If you were strip-searched on or before November 18, 1996, it may be too \nlate to bring a lawsuit.  The time period for the class ends on December 31, 2004. If you were strip-\nsearched after this date, that search is not a part of this lawsuit; you must file your own lawsuit.  \n \nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\n \nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime. \n \nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the settlement? \n \nIf you are still unsure as to whether you are a member of the class, you may fill out and return the \nSettlement Claim Form.  If the settlement is approved, you will be notified if you do not qualify. If you \nqualify you will receive a check.  You may also visit the settlement website on the Internet at \nwww.knoxcountyjailclass.com or call (877) 797-5732 to speak to a Settlement Administrator or Class \nCounsel to answer your questions.  \n \nHow did the lawyers in this case find me and how can I protect my privacy? \n \nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address at the Knox County Jail during booking.  This \ninformation was given to the lawyers for the plaintiffs by Knox County pursuant to a court order. The \nlawyers for the plaintiffs will do everything they can to protect your privacy.  Only the lawyers in the \ncase and the Court appointed Claims Administrator will know your name and, in most cases, only the \nClaims Administrator will see your Claim Form.  \n \n4\nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n\n \nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING \n \nWhat is a Fairness Hearing? \n \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.  The Court will consider \nwhether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. The Court will also decide whether to approve \nthe request for attorney’s fees, costs, expenses and the bonuses to class representatives. If the Court \napproves the proposed settlement, it will affect all class members.      \n \nWhen and where is the hearing? \n \nThe Hearing will be at tba a.m./p.m. on day, April 2, 2007 in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 \nFederal Street, Portland, ME.  \n \nDo I have to come to the hearing? \n \nClass counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. You are welcome to come at your own \nexpense. If you object to the settlement and you want to explain the objection to the Court you can \nattend the hearing or hire your own lawyer to attend for you.     \n \nMay I or my lawyer speak at the hearing? \n \nYes, but only if you or your lawyer filed a written objection before the hearing. \n \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT   \n \nWhat if I think the proposed settlement is not fair? What can I do? \n \nIf you wish to object to the proposed settlement, you must state your objections to the Court in a letter \nsent to the Tardiff Settlement Claims Administrator, postmarked by January 19, 2007.  The Claims \nAdministrator will forward your objection to the Court and to the lawyers for the plaintiffs and for Knox \nCounty. If you want to explain the written objection to the court you, or a lawyer on your behalf, can \nappear in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 Federal Street, Portland, ME on April 2, 2007 to present \nyour objections. \n \nYou may object to the proposed settlement and still be eligible to receive a payment.  You must submit \na valid Settlement Claim Form even if you object to the settlement, if you wish to claim money should \nthe settlement be approved. \n \nTHE LAWYERS IN THIS CASE \n \nWho are the lawyers in this case? \n \nThe lawyers for the plaintiffs are Robert Stolt, Esq., and Sumner Lipman, Esq., Lipman, Katz & McKee, \n227 Water Street, P.O.

SUMMARY \n \n  The parties agreed to settle this case on Friday, September 29, 2006 at the Judicial \nSettlement conference with Chief Judge Singal (Docket item No.  328), the general terms \nof which are set forth in a written settlement agreement signed by all parties on \nSeptember 29, 2006.    Under the summary agreements, the parties were required to \nsubmit, using the Second Amended Settlement Agreement approved in Nilsen v. York \nCounty, (02 -CV-212-P-H.) their final written agreement, along with a Motion to  \nRecertify the Class.(Docket item No.  368, supra).   \nOn December 18, 2006 the Court entered It's Order  approving Plaintiff's Motion \nFor Approval Of Third Final Settlement Agreement, thus giving preliminary approval to \nthe agreement between the parties and authorizing the issuance of a class wide notice \"in \na reasonable manner\" as required by Rule 23 (e) (1) (B).  The court also set a hearing \n1 \n\nunder Rule 23 (e) (1) (c) to determine whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and \nadequate; whether any request for attorneys fees and non-taxable cost should be allowed \nand, if so, the extent of such allowance; and resolution of any other issues then properly \nbefore the Court. The hearing under Rule 23 (e) (1) (c) is scheduled to take place on April \n23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m.(Docket item No.  378).  Additionally, the Court issued an \ninjunctive Order designed to prevent unconstitutional strip searches in the future (Docket \nitem No.  379). \nII.   Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, 2003, \nJudge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine granted \nplaintiff's motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action under \nFed.R. Civ. P 23 (b) (3).  The class was defined as follows: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or \nvisual body cavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion \nwhile being held at the Knox County Jail: \n(1)  After having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, \nor a violent felony; or     \n(2)  While waiting for bail to be set up on charges that did not involve a \nweapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n(3)  While waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n2 \n\n(4)   After having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, \ndrugs, or a violent felony.  (See Docket Item No. 21) \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court \nof Appeals for the First Circuit, Tardiff vs. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004). \nPlaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pretrial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof a booking procedure.  The defendants have denied those allegations and have asserted \nthat both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and procedures \nwere at all times consistent with constitutional requirements. \nThis case has been in litigation since November, 2002.  Partial Summary  \nJudgment was granted to the Plaintiffs on November 2, 2005.  The Court ordered on a \nsmall rollback of the Partial Summary Judgment in April of 2006 requiring Plaintiffs to \nprove an unconstitutional custom and practice for class members strip-searched between \nSeptember 2002 and December 2004.   A trial, originally scheduled to begin April 1, \n2006, was postponed until May 1, 2006 and then to October 3, 2006. The parties, like the  \nfamed the light brigade, charged into summer with no thought to what September would \nbring.  The parties interviewed, deposed, motioned and strategized fiercely aiming for the \nkiller strike that would put them a leg up and demoralize the other side.  On September 5, \n2006 court decertified the class with respect to damages, disqualified all witnesses, \nshredded all exhibits and denied all motions.  The parties retreated, seeking shelter in the \nchambers of Chief Judge Singal.  On September 29 Chief Judge Singal brought the battle \n3 \n\nto a close through an all day Judicial Settlement Conference.1  Following instructions of \nChief Judge Singal to prepare a final written agreement using the Second Amended \nAgreement approved in Nilsen v. York County, (02-CV-212-P.-H.), the parties began the \nprocess while hammering out that final agreement.  On December 18, 2006 the Court \nrewarded the parties' efforts by approving preliminarily the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement.  (Docket Item No.:  378). \nIII.   SUMMARY OF SETTLEMENT TERMS \nThe Settlement reached by the parties secures a remarkable recovery for class \nmembers.  Under the settlement, the Defendants have created a settlement fund of $3 \nmillion dollars from which payments to class members, class representatives, class \ncounsel, and the Claims Administrator will be made.  This is an extraordinary outcome \nfor the Class because approximately 366 class members will share in a fund which will \npay them significantly more than they might have received had they gone individually to \ntrial. \n  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, each class member who timely \nsubmits a completed and signed claim form postmarked no later than February 12, 2007, \nwill, if his claim is approved, receive a payment from the common fund (after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants) calculated on the basis of \none share for every class member with an approved claim.  Class members wishing to opt \n                                                 \n1 The parties had previously attempted to mediate the dispute with the assistance of former Maine Supreme Judicial \nCourt Chief Justice Daniel Wathen.  The two days spent with the Chief Justice Wathen brought focus to the parties' \nperceptions but did not resolve the case. \n4 \n\nout of the settlement are required to file a properly executed to opt-out form on or before \nFebruary 12, 2007. \n  In the terms of the settlement agreement, a portion of the settlement fund shall be \nused, subject to Court approval, to pay the cost of administering the settlement as well as \na plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses.  Class counsel have separately applied to the \nCourt for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $900,000.00 (which represents \n30% of the settlement fund of 3 million), for reimbursement of $178,561.41 in expenses, \nand for $35,0002 to cover the estimated Cost of Administering the Settlement.  \nThe Settlement Agreement also provides for an incentive award in the amount of \n$5,000 for the class representative of record as of the date of the Final Approval of the \nsettlement and a $500 bonus for each of the 20 class members who were deposed by the \ndefendants. \n  The Settlement Agreement will completely settle and resolve this class action.  \nUnless a class member opted out by the timely submission of a valid opt-out form, the \nsettlement will fully bind all members of the class.  As the settlement agreement \nprovides: \"in consideration of the settlement amount, all defendants,... will be released \nfrom all liability for the class members’ claims for unlawful strip searches that were part \nof this lawsuit, including class members who do not file claims, except for any class \nmembers who requested exclusion, opted out, and filed an individual lawsuit within the \n                                                 \n2 Analytics initial estimate of claims administrative expenses was $35,000.00 (see Exhibit B, Motion for Attorney’s Fees , Cost \nOf Litigation And Expenses Of Settlement Administration), class counsel had paid Analytics $8,684.33 and have another invoice \nin transit in the amount of $21,933.37, for a total to date of $30,617.70 in claims administration expenses.  Analytics will provide \nan updated estimate of the expenses expected to be necessary to close out the claims administration phase of this case.   \n \n5 \n\napplicable statute of limitations.  The parties have expressly agreed that the release of \nclaims arising from the settlement includes all visual inspections, including without \nlimitation visual body cavity inspections, that otherwise fall within the scope of the \nclaims certified as a class action by the Court in this case.  The parties further agree that \nthis release of claims applies to any claims that the strip searches were conducted in a \nmanner that was unlawful, including without limitation, claims of physical touching, \ncross- gender searches, or searches which were observed by persons other than the \ncorrectional officer performing the search.  The parties further agree that their settlement \ndoes not release any other claims, such as wrongful arrest, excessive force, or searches \nthat were not part of the admissions process (such as strip searches after a lockdown).” \n  Class members have been notified of the settlement pursuant to the Notice Plan \napproved by the Court in its Order granting preliminary approval of the settlement \n(Docket item No.  376-2). First, a Notice Package consisting of a Notice of Class Action \nSettlement and of the Hearing to Approve the Settlement (\"Notice of Settlement\"), a \nSettlement Claim Form, a Frequently Asked Questions sheet and an Opt-Out Form, by \nfirst-class mail postage prepaid to all potential class members, whose addresses are \nknown to Class Counsel at their last known address within three weeks after the Court \nOrder granting preliminary approval.  Second, creation of a website, www \nknoxcountyjailclass.com, where Notice of Settlement and the Settlement Claim Form and \nthe Opt-Out Form are available for downloading from the website or on request to the \nClaims Administrator including through a toll-free number. Third, publication of the \nNotice of Settlement twice in the Portland Press Herald, Rockland Courier Gazette and \n6 \n\nthe Bangor Daily News.  Fourth, posting the Notice of Settlement in the Knox County \nJail. Fifth, the issuance of a press release detailing preliminary approval of the settlement, \nhow to obtain the appropriate Claims and Opt-Out Forms, the dead-line for filing and \nNotice of the date and time of the Final Fairness Hearing. \nIV.    The proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate \n  A class-action settlement that “...is fair, adequate and reasonable\" may be \napproved by the Court.  Fed.R. Civ. P 23 (e)(1)(C), and City Partnership Co. v.  Atlantic \nAcquisition Ltd. Partnership, 100 F.3d 1041, 1043 (1st Cir.1996).  The criteria relevant to  \ndetermination of whether a settlements is fair, reasonable, and adequate are: (1) \ncomparison of the proposed the settlement with the likely results of litigation; (2) reaction \nof the class to the settlement; (3) stage of the litigation and the amount of discovery \ncompleted; (4) quality of counsel; (5) conduct of the negotiations; and(6) prospects of the \ncase, including risk, complexity, expense and duration. In re Compact Disc Minimum \nAdvertised Price Antitrust Litigation, 216 F.R D. 197, 206-07 (D.  Me.2003) and Alba \nConte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions (4th ed. 2002), section 11.43.  In \nIn re Compact Disc, the Court indicated that \"a settlement following sufficient discovery \nand genuine arm's-length negotiation is presumed fair. In re Compact Disc,  supra at 207. \nA.  A Comparison of Settlement Terms with Litigation Prospects.  \n  The first and six factors-comparison of proposed settlement with likely results of \nlitigation, and prospects of the case, including risk, complexity, expense, duration-\n7 \n\noverlap, and may be analyzed together.  \"In evaluating the substantive fairness of a class-\naction settlement, the Court cannot and should not, use as a benchmark  the highest award \nthat could be made to the plaintiff after full and successful litigation of the claim.\" \nDuhaime v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 177 F.R.D.54,68 (D. Mass. 1997).  \nRather, the question is \"whether the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits \nbalances appropriately against the amount and form of the relief offered in settlement.\"  \nId.. ( \"quoting Santana v. Collazo, 714 F.2d 1172, 1175 (1st Cir. 1983); see also Ramirez \nv. DeCoster, 203 F.R.D.30, 33 (D. Me. 2001) (deferring to \"the parties ... assessment of \ntheir respective risks ....”). \n  The parties litigated this case completely through discovery.  The case was hard \nfought with no stone left unturned.  Comprehensive interrogatories and document request \nwere made, 25 depositions were taken, a physical inspection of the Knox County Jail \nbooking area and process was conducted and extensive information was obtained \nelectronically by on-site inspection of the jails electronic records.  Class counsel \ncontacted numerous potential claimants and the parties interviewed more than a hundred \nabsent class members.  The Defendants also produced 25 bankers boxes of intake and \nrelease records.  From the production of the paper and electronic records, the depositions, \ninterviews and contacts with class members, both parties were able to assemble databases \npermitting them to narrow the field of eligible class members.  While the parties’ \nestimations of the number of eligible class members narrowed the field to about 7,000 \nclaimants, the parties estimations of how many of those 7,000 were strip searched varied \n8 \n\nby a wide margin.  Because of the poor quality of the records, it was not possible to \nnarrow the gap.  Plaintiffs’ included in their count all eligible class members held at the \njail without bail as well as those whose intake records clearly indicated the class member \nwere strip searched.  The Jail’s estimate included only those individuals which the \nrecords identify explicitly as having been strip searched.   \n  The depositions taken by the Plaintiffs of the jail administrator and the State’s \nChief Jail Inspector established that Jail policy was to strip search everyone held at the \njail. While this threshold issue of liability was strongly defended, Plaintiffs’ won \nSummary Judgment on the issue both with respect to Knox County’s “policy” and \n“custom and practice”.  The Court later rolled back Summary Judgment on the “custom \nand practice’ count, granting summary judgment to the Plaintiffs for the period \nNovember 19, 1996 through August 31, 2002 and leaving open for trial “custom and \npractice” liability for those people detained between September 1, 2002 and December \n31, 2004.   \n  The parties made two efforts at settlement, both in 2006. First in April of 2006, the \nparties spent 2 days trying to hammer out a settlement with former Maine Supreme \nJudicial Court Chief Justice Daniel Wathen as mediator.  The parties were unsuccessful \nin achieving a settlement at that time, but were able to achieve a sharper focus of the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their respective claims and the complexities facing them in \ntrial of the case.   \n9 \n\n  If the parties did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable assessment \nof their risk at trial, the Court made those risks crystal clear on September 5, 2006 when \nit decertified the class for damages, disqualified all witnesses and shredded all exhibits.  \nSee Luevano v. Campbell, 93 Frd 68, 86 (D.D.C. 1981); Ressler v. Jacobson, 822 Fed. \nSupp 1551, 1554-55 (N.D. FLA 1992) and In Re:  Marine Midland Motor Vehicle \nLeasing Litigation, 155 Frd 416, 420 (W.D.N.Y. 1994).   Further aided by Chief Judge \nSingal’s telescopic vision and a full day of discussion, the parties were able to settle the \ncase for Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00).   \n  Under the terms of the settlement each class member who timely submits a valid \nclaim should receive from the net settlement fund a cash payment in the neighborhood of \n$5,000.00.  This approximated share of the settlement is calculated by dividing  One \nMillion Nine Hundred Eighty-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,985,000.00), [$2,000,000.00 \nminus $15,000.00 in incentive and bonus awards by 366 (approximate number of claims \nexpected to be approved)].  Each approved class member will receive and equal share of \nthis fund.  Class Counsel proposes that the remaining One Million Dollars \n($1,000,000.00) of the gross settlement fund, plus accrued interest, be used to pay \nawarded attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses and the cost of settlement administration with \nany excess remaining to be cy pres’d.  \n  Plaintiffs ask the Court to order, as part of the requested final approval order, that \nthe payment to each claimant be calculated such that $2,000,000.00 of the settlement \nfund (net of attorney’s fees and costs, settlement expenses and incentive awards) be \n10 \n\ndivided by all class members submitting valid claims. The language of the settlement \nagreement permits the Court to Order that the actual payment to claimants be calculated \nto consume the entire residual corpus of the net settlement amount.  Plaintiffs fully expect \nthis number to final out at $2,000,000.00 dollars.  Should there be some residual amount \nleft in the fund after all expenses are paid, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \napply cy pres rules to that excess.   \n  The $3,000,000.00 settlement was achieved not withstanding Defendants steadfast \ndenial of any liability to the class.  Defendants have not denied that the challenged strip \nsearch practice occurred but have vigorously asserted that it was neither unlawful nor \nharmful to the claimants. While the Plaintiffs believe that they were able to prove their \nclaims and defend their verdict and summary judgment on appeal, the Defendants  \ninterposed numerous legal and constitutional defenses which they said they would \ncontinue to exert vigorously at trial and on appeal.  Continuing litigation of these \ndefenses notwithstanding, trial on the remaining issues of liability and then individual \ntrials on issues of damages would have been extraordinarily expensive for both sides \nexhausting them physically and financially and also exhausting the limited resources of \nthe Court. See Murillo v. Texas A & M University System, 921 F.Supp 443, 447 (S.D. \nTex. 1996).   \n  The substantial benefits of the proposed settlement compared to the nightmare \nahead would the case were tried is, in and of itself, evidence that the settlement is fair \nreasonable and adequate.  It brings closure to the issues and lays to rest all planned \n11 \n\nappeals. The Court has issued an Injunctive Order prohibiting future strip searches of the \ncaliber challenged by the Plaintiffs and qualified class members who have filed claims \nwill receive a substantial monetary payment under the settlement.  There have been a few \nopt outs.  While one or more of those who chose to opt out and who move forward to \nlitigate their individual claims to conclusion may prevail at trial and may end up with a  \nmore substantial recovery than what the settlement agreement provides, that recovery \nwould come at a cost so prohibitive as to dwarf any additional amount recovered by them \neven though some may be able to use the work of Class Counsel, the Partial Summary \nJudgment and the Injunctive Order to their advantage.   \n  The Settlement Agreement also provides for an incentive award in the amount of \n$5,000.00 to the named class representative.  The proposed incentive award is fair and \nreasonable given the substantial benefit the Plaintiffs have secured for the class.  See In \nRe:  Mego Financial Corp. Securities Litigation, 213 F3rd 454, 457, 463 (9th Cir. 2000).  \nThe bonus of $500.00 to each of the class members who were deposed by the Defendants \nis also fair and reasonable given the substantial benefit the named Plaintiffs have secured \nfor the class and the singling out that these courageous individuals endured in order to \nadvance the cause of the entire class. \nB.  Reaction of the Class \n  The second factor, reaction of the class to the proposed settlement, also weighs in \nfavor of final approval.  Four Hundred Twenty-Three (423) people submitted claims \n12 \n\nforms.  Eight (8) people opted out.  Fifty-Seven (57) claims were denied.  Three Hundred \nSixty-Six (366) claims were approved.  The deadline for filing a claim form or opting out \nwas February 12, 2007.  No one asked for an extension of the filing deadlines and no \nobjections to the settlement have been filed.   \nC.  Stage of Litigation \n  The third factor, the stage of litigation and extent of discovery completed, further \nsupports approval of the proposed settlement.  The discovery has been ongoing for four \nyears.  It was extended several times. The Plaintiffs deposed the Knox County Jail \nAdministrator and the Chief Jail Inspector of the State of Maine.  Defendants deposed 19 \nnamed class members and interviewed more than 100 absent class members. Defendants \nproduced thousands of pages of jail records and thousands of lines of electronic data.  \nExperts on both sides reviewed the data extracted electronically and from the paper \ndocuments to build and analyze data files.  Experts on both sides also were deposed and \nlisted for trial as damage experts.  The extensive discovery in this case, extensive \nsettlement discussions and legal challenges to the class certification and the legalities of \nPlaintiffs theories have given class counsel and counsel for the defense a clear \nunderstanding of the scope and strengths of the Plaintiffs claims and the Defendants’ \ndefenses and a firm conviction that the settlement constitutes a fair, reasonable and \nadequate resolution of those claims.   \nD.  Quality of Class Counsel \n13 \n\n  The fourth factor, quality of Class Counsel, also supports final approval.  Class \ncounsel had extensive experience in local and national class action litigation as \ndocumented in class counsel’s application for award of attorney’s fees and award of \nlitigation expenses and claims administration fees.   \nE.  Conduct of Negotiations \n  The fifth factor, conduct of negotiations, further buttresses the case for final \napproval. Hard fought, arms length negotiations extended over a period of about one-\nyear, during which time the parties were far apart on their positions and ultimately \nneeded the assistance of Magistrate Judge Cohen to pick a mediator.  Numerous in person \nand telephonic conferences were conducted between counsel and among counsel to get \nsettlement discussions going and then to consummate those discussions with the \nassistance of Chief Judge Singal.  The parties were scrupulous in using independent \nmediators who could diffuse the contentious nature of the negotiations and keep the \nparties focused on the object of the mediation.  Although a two day long session with \nformer Maine Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Daniel Wathen proved fruitless, a \nday long session with Chief Judge Singal on the eve of trial brought the parties to terms.   \n  Settlement negotiations were arms length, hard fought and ultimately successful. \nBecause of those struggles, the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable.  It is an \nexcellent recovery for the Class and Plaintiffs respectfully submit that final approval \nshould be granted.   \n14 \n\nIV.  The notice plan is fair, adequate and reasonable.  \nRule 23 requires class members to receive notice of a proposed class action \nsettlement.  The notice must be “the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \nincluding individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \neffort.”  Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacqueline, 417 U.S. 156, 173 (1974) quoting Fed. R.C.P. \n23(c)(2)(B).  The notice must indicate the nature of the class and its claims, and explain \nthat class members have the option of entertaining an appearance through counsel or \nopting out of the settlement, and make clear the binding effect of a judgment on class \nmembers.  Id. \n  The parties, with the persistent assistance of the Court, crafted an efficient and \neffective plan for notifying class members of the proposed settlement and getting \nsettlement funds into the hands of class members. The notice and claims administration \nplan (Docket Item No. 382-1, sets out in detail the method by which class members have \nbeen notified of their rights.  Notice has been sent to each class member at his last known \naddress where the parties had such an address.  Notice of the proposed settlement was \npublished pursuant to the Court’s Order, twice in the Portland Press Herald, Rockland \nCourier Gazette and the Bangor Daily News.  Posters were posted in the Knox County \nJail throughout the period where claims could be filed and the Claims Administrator \nestablished a website:  www.knoxcountyjailclass.com enabling potential class members \nto obtain the notice information and download claims and opt out forms.   \n15 \n\n  The notice was designed to make clear to class members the existence and nature \nof the lawsuit, the terms of the proposed settlement and their options with respect to \nsettlement both in filing a claim or opting out.  Plaintiffs therefore believe it is fair, \nadequate and reasonable and should be approved. \nCONCLUSION\n  For the above reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court grant final approval \nof the settlement and the notice plan in this action.   \n \nDated:  March 30, 2007   /s/ Sumner Lipman  \n              Sumner Lipman, Esq. \n        Attorney  for Plaintiffs \n              Lipman, Katz & McKee \n        227  Water Street, P.O.

Fadgen, Prescott, Jamieson, \nNelson & Murphy, LLC, Portland, ME, for Defendants. \nORDER ON MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF THIRD \nFINAL CLASS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nGENE CARTER, Senior District Judge. \nThis is a class action lawsuit over strip searches of arrestees at the Knox County Jail. The \nCourt previously certified a class and the Court of Appeals affirmed the certification. Tardiff \nv. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332 (D.Me.2003), affd, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1 st Cir.2004).[1] The \nparties proposed 15*15 for preliminary approval an agreement settling their dispute (Docket \nItem No. 351). They requested that the Court preliminarily approve the settlement for \nissuance of class-wide notice. The Court held a hearing on this motion on October 24, \n2006[2] and declined to preliminarily approve that Agreement. See Docket Item No. 368. \nThe Court notes that the agreement does now provide for a second opportunity for putative \nclass members to request exclusion as permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(e)(3). See Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) VI, ¶ 10, at 10; \nOrder on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368). \n\nThe Court further notes that the parties have achieved resolution by agreement of all issues \nrespecting the entry of injunctive relief by the parties agreeing to the Court's entry of its \nAmended Proposed Permanent Injunction, see Docket Item No. 364. The Third Final \nSettlement Agreement now provides specifically: \n\"The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction[,] the purpose of which will be \nto ensure the Defendants' compliance with Fourth Amendment law governing strip \nsearches. The parties have agreed on the terms of the injunction which are set forth in the \nCourt's Amended [Proposed] Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 364), and all parties waive their rights to appeal the entry of, or terms of, \nthis injunctive Order.\" \nSee Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) at 3^; Court's Amended \nProposed Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement at 1 (Docket Item No. \n364); Order on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368) at 3. \nOtherwise, the Court finds that the notice that the parties have proposed with the revisions \nmade on the record by this 16*16 Court today amounts to \"notice in a reasonable manner\" \nas required by Rule 23(e)(1)(B). The Court hereby ORDERS that: \n(1) The Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1 to 376-8) be, and it is \nhereby, PRELIMINARILY APPROVED for purposes of issuance of direct class-wide notice \nand further proceedings, as revised, and that direct class-wide notice thereof issue forthwith \nas per Docket Item No. 376-2 as revised; \n(2) Any motion for attorney's fees and nontaxable costs shall be filed by such a time that the \nRule 23(h)(1) notice of the fee request can be combined with the Rule 23(e) notice of \nsettlement and be sent to the class at the same time and that any such motion be supported \nin detail.See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 801 F.Supp. 804 (D.Me. 1992); \n(3) The exhibits to the Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1) that is, \nDocket Item Nos. 376-2 through 376-8, be, and are hereby APPROVED as revised; \n(4) All putative class members may exercise a right to opt out of the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement in conformity with the Agreement's terms; \n(5) A hearing under Rule 23(e)(1)(c) is hereby scheduled to take place on April 23, 2007 at \n10:00 a.m. on whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate; whether any \nrequests for attorney fees and nontaxable costs should be allowed and, if so, the extent of \nsuch allowance; and resolution of any other issues then properly before the Court. The \n\nCourt will hear appropriate objections on all those matters at that time. See Rule \n23(e)(4)(A), (h)(2) and (h)(3); \n(6) The Court's Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Third Final Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 379) shall issue forthwith. \nThe Court does not intend this order to be a preliminary fairness determination. Because, as \nthe Court has indicated in its prior Order, a judicial determination of \"preliminary fairness\" \nunjustifiably suggests a headwind against objections to the settlement agreement, the Court \nwill only determine at the final approval hearing whether the proposed Third Final \nSettlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the class action settlement in \nthis case. \nThe Court NOTES that Ms. Tardiff, the previously designated class representative, \npresently remains as a putative class member. The Court is not asked to make, and does \nnot make, any decision as to her rights in this litigation and intimates no opinion on any \nmatter bearing on such subject, or whether she is subject to being bound by any Settlement \nAgreement proposed herein or that may be finally approved by the Court. The Court's \nultimate resolution of any such issues, if any, shall not be a basis for any party or class \nmember to challenge, inter partes, the viability or enforceability of the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement of the class action, if it is finally approved by the Court. \nIt is FURTHER ORDERED that class counsel proceed with the execution of the orders and \ninstructions provided for herein necessary to the implementation of the settlement \npreparatory to the final fairness hearing on April 23, 2007. \n[1] The original putative class member designated as the named plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was permitted to withdraw as \na class representative by the Court's Order of October 24, 2006 (Docket Item No. 367) and Dale Dare, another \noriginal putative class member, was substituted for her by that Order. The case is now properly styled Dare v. Knox \nCounty, et al., Civ. No. 02-251-P-C. \n[2] As a result of prior settlement negotiations of the parties in conference with Chief Judge Singal, the class counsel \nfiled on October 10, 2006 a proposed Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 339) with a Motion Seeking \nPreliminary Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 338). The Defendants' counsel submitted on the same \ndate its own version of a Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 342). The Court held a conference/hearing \nwith counsel and the parties on October 11, 2006 in open court, and it appeared that there were significant variations \nin the two proposals. The parties were left to resume negotiations following the conference/hearing to see if a \ndefinitive proposed Settlement Agreement could be arrived at by them. See Transcript (Docket Item No. 357). They \nsubsequently filed a second Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 351). \nThe situation in respect to settlement was further complicated by the position taken by the named class \nrepresentative, Laurie Tardiff, at the conference/hearing that she objected to the terms of the Settlement and wished \nto withdraw as class representative in the action. The Court advised her to promptly consult individual counsel and on \nOctober 13, 2006 new counsel entered an appearance on her behalf (Docket Item Nos. 346 and 349). Since then, \nclass counsel has filed a Motion to Strike Laurie Tardiff as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 350), which was \nlater withdrawn (Docket Item No. 354). The Court subsequently granted a Motion, filed by class counsel, to Substitute \na Party, Dale Dare, as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 355) and a Motion filed by Ms. Tardiff's personal \ncounsel to withdraw Ms. Tardiff as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 356). \n\nThe Court scheduled all these pending matters for further conference/hearing on October 24, 2006. A further \nconference of the Court and counsel was held on the record (See Docket Item No. 375) on November 27, 2006. As a \nresult of further negotiations of counsel, the presently pending Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. \n376) has been filed and substituted for Docket Item No. 351. It is this latter agreement on which the Court now acts. \n ",

Order on Motion for Approval of Third Final \nSettlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 378). The Agreement, as approved, provides that: \nThe Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction the purpose of which will be to \nensure the Defendants' compliance with Fourth Amendment law governing strip searches. \nThe parties have agreed on the terms of the injunction which are set forth in the Court's \nAmended Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 364), \nand all parties waive their rights to appeal the entry of, and the terms of this Injunctive \nOrder. \n\nSettlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1), 11(B)(2), at pp. 3-4. It is the purpose of this \ninjunction to ensure that the Defendants comply with Fourth Amendment law governing strip \nsearches. \nThe Agreement also provides: \n\"The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders as appropriate to \nenforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and to effect fair and \norderly administration.\" \nId. ¶ III(1), at p. 6. \nNOW, THEREFORE, in the exercise of the enforcement authority conferred on the Court by \nParagraph III(l) of the Settlement Agreement and by the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, it is \nhereby ORDERED that Knox County, its Sheriff, the Sheriffs appointees and all other jail \nemployees be, and are hereby ENJOINED from strip searching (see Wood v. Hancock \nCounty, 354 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.2003)(defining \"strip search\")) any persons charged with a \ncrime that does not involve weapons, violence or controlled or scheduled substances during \nthe jail admission process— i.e., while such persons are being held awaiting bail or a first \ncourt appearance, or after being arrested on a default or other warrant—unless the officer \nor person conducting the strip search has reasonable suspicion to believe the person does \npossess a weapon, controlled or scheduled substances, or other contraband. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants and Sheriff Davey's successors in office shall \nbe required to keep at the Knox County Jail a written log that shall record every instance in \nwhich an individual 18*18 is hereafter determined to be subject, for admission purposes at \nthe Knox County Jail, to a strip search procedure, the following information: \n(1) The date and time of the search procedure; \n(2) The name of each officer participating in the search procedure; \n(3) A brief statement of facts found to constitute \"reasonable suspicion\" for a strip search, to \ninclude the crime with which the individual was charged; and \n(4) The name of the officer who made the determination that \"reasonable suspicion\" \nwarranted a strip search and who approved the search. \nSuch log shall be available for public inspection at reasonable times during the County's \nbusiness day in a manner similar to 1 M.R.S.A. § 408. \n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the obligations of the Defendants under this Injunction are \nintended to conform to Fourth Amendment law governing strip searches. In the event that \nfuture decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, \nor the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine hold that jails may conduct strip searches \nthat are expressly prohibited by this Injunction, the Defendants shall have the right to \npetition the Court for a modification of the Injunction consistent with the above-referenced \ndecisions. Such petition shall be decided on a determination as to whether the requested \nmodification is in conformity with the change in law, and it shall not be reviewed under a \nheightened standard of review. In the event the Plaintiff class opposes such a petition \nthrough counsel, the Plaintiff class shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees if the \nPlaintiff class is the prevailing party with regard to the petition. \n ",

Fadgen, Prescott, Jamieson, \nNelson & Murphy, LLC, Portland, ME, for Defendants. \nORDER ON MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF THIRD \nFINAL CLASS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nGENE CARTER, Senior District Judge. \nThis is a class action lawsuit over strip searches of arrestees at the Knox County Jail. The \nCourt previously certified a class and the Court of Appeals affirmed the certification. Tardiff \nv. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332 (D.Me.2003), affd, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1 st Cir.2004).[1] The \nparties proposed 15*15 for preliminary approval an agreement settling their dispute (Docket \nItem No. 351). They requested that the Court preliminarily approve the settlement for \nissuance of class-wide notice. The Court held a hearing on this motion on October 24, \n2006[2] and declined to preliminarily approve that Agreement. See Docket Item No. 368. \nThe Court notes that the agreement does now provide for a second opportunity for putative \nclass members to request exclusion as permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(e)(3). See Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) VI, ¶ 10, at 10; \nOrder on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368). \n\nThe Court further notes that the parties have achieved resolution by agreement of all issues \nrespecting the entry of injunctive relief by the parties agreeing to the Court's entry of its \nAmended Proposed Permanent Injunction, see Docket Item No. 364. The Third Final \nSettlement Agreement now provides specifically: \n\"The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction[,] the purpose of which will be \nto ensure the Defendants' compliance with Fourth Amendment law governing strip \nsearches. The parties have agreed on the terms of the injunction which are set forth in the \nCourt's Amended [Proposed] Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 364), and all parties waive their rights to appeal the entry of, or terms of, \nthis injunctive Order.\" \nSee Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376) at 3^; Court's Amended \nProposed Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Settlement Agreement at 1 (Docket Item No. \n364); Order on Motion for Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 368) at 3. \nOtherwise, the Court finds that the notice that the parties have proposed with the revisions \nmade on the record by this 16*16 Court today amounts to \"notice in a reasonable manner\" \nas required by Rule 23(e)(1)(B). The Court hereby ORDERS that: \n(1) The Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1 to 376-8) be, and it is \nhereby, PRELIMINARILY APPROVED for purposes of issuance of direct class-wide notice \nand further proceedings, as revised, and that direct class-wide notice thereof issue forthwith \nas per Docket Item No. 376-2 as revised; \n(2) Any motion for attorney's fees and nontaxable costs shall be filed by such a time that the \nRule 23(h)(1) notice of the fee request can be combined with the Rule 23(e) notice of \nsettlement and be sent to the class at the same time and that any such motion be supported \nin detail.See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., 801 F.Supp. 804 (D.Me. 1992); \n(3) The exhibits to the Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 376-1) that is, \nDocket Item Nos. 376-2 through 376-8, be, and are hereby APPROVED as revised; \n(4) All putative class members may exercise a right to opt out of the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement in conformity with the Agreement's terms; \n(5) A hearing under Rule 23(e)(1)(c) is hereby scheduled to take place on April 23, 2007 at \n10:00 a.m. on whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate; whether any \nrequests for attorney fees and nontaxable costs should be allowed and, if so, the extent of \nsuch allowance; and resolution of any other issues then properly before the Court. The \n\nCourt will hear appropriate objections on all those matters at that time. See Rule \n23(e)(4)(A), (h)(2) and (h)(3); \n(6) The Court's Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Third Final Settlement Agreement \n(Docket Item No. 379) shall issue forthwith. \nThe Court does not intend this order to be a preliminary fairness determination. Because, as \nthe Court has indicated in its prior Order, a judicial determination of \"preliminary fairness\" \nunjustifiably suggests a headwind against objections to the settlement agreement, the Court \nwill only determine at the final approval hearing whether the proposed Third Final \nSettlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the class action settlement in \nthis case. \nThe Court NOTES that Ms. Tardiff, the previously designated class representative, \npresently remains as a putative class member. The Court is not asked to make, and does \nnot make, any decision as to her rights in this litigation and intimates no opinion on any \nmatter bearing on such subject, or whether she is subject to being bound by any Settlement \nAgreement proposed herein or that may be finally approved by the Court. The Court's \nultimate resolution of any such issues, if any, shall not be a basis for any party or class \nmember to challenge, inter partes, the viability or enforceability of the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement of the class action, if it is finally approved by the Court. \nIt is FURTHER ORDERED that class counsel proceed with the execution of the orders and \ninstructions provided for herein necessary to the implementation of the settlement \npreparatory to the final fairness hearing on April 23, 2007. \n[1] The original putative class member designated as the named plaintiff, Laurie Tardiff, was permitted to withdraw as \na class representative by the Court's Order of October 24, 2006 (Docket Item No. 367) and Dale Dare, another \noriginal putative class member, was substituted for her by that Order. The case is now properly styled Dare v. Knox \nCounty, et al., Civ. No. 02-251-P-C. \n[2] As a result of prior settlement negotiations of the parties in conference with Chief Judge Singal, the class counsel \nfiled on October 10, 2006 a proposed Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 339) with a Motion Seeking \nPreliminary Approval of Class Settlement (Docket Item No. 338). The Defendants' counsel submitted on the same \ndate its own version of a Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 342). The Court held a conference/hearing \nwith counsel and the parties on October 11, 2006 in open court, and it appeared that there were significant variations \nin the two proposals. The parties were left to resume negotiations following the conference/hearing to see if a \ndefinitive proposed Settlement Agreement could be arrived at by them. See Transcript (Docket Item No. 357). They \nsubsequently filed a second Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. 351). \nThe situation in respect to settlement was further complicated by the position taken by the named class \nrepresentative, Laurie Tardiff, at the conference/hearing that she objected to the terms of the Settlement and wished \nto withdraw as class representative in the action. The Court advised her to promptly consult individual counsel and on \nOctober 13, 2006 new counsel entered an appearance on her behalf (Docket Item Nos. 346 and 349). Since then, \nclass counsel has filed a Motion to Strike Laurie Tardiff as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 350), which was \nlater withdrawn (Docket Item No. 354). The Court subsequently granted a Motion, filed by class counsel, to Substitute \na Party, Dale Dare, as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 355) and a Motion filed by Ms. Tardiff's personal \ncounsel to withdraw Ms. Tardiff as Class Representative (Docket Item No. 356). \n\nThe Court scheduled all these pending matters for further conference/hearing on October 24, 2006. A further \nconference of the Court and counsel was held on the record (See Docket Item No. 375) on November 27, 2006. As a \nresult of further negotiations of counsel, the presently pending Third Final Settlement Agreement (Docket Item No. \n376) has been filed and substituted for Docket Item No. 351. It is this latter agreement on which the Court now acts. \n ",

See Amended Complaint (Docket Item \nNo. 2).  Specifically, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges that as a result of being strip \nsearched without reasonable suspicion their constitutional rights were violated by Knox \nCounty (Count I), Sheriff Daniel Davey (Count II), Corrections Officer Jane Doe (Count \nIV) and Corrections Officer John Doe (Count VI).1  The class previously certified in this \ncase is as follows: \n                                                 \n1 Counts III, V, and VII request punitive damages based on the alleged constitutional violations. \n\nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip \nsearch and/or visual body cavity search without evaluation for \nindividualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox \nCounty Jail: \n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did \nnot involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or  \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that \ndid not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; \nor  \n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on \ncharges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a \nviolent felony; or  \n \n(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony.     \n \nPlaintiffs now move for Summary Judgment with respect to all liability claims.    \nI. FACTS \nA. State Standards Applicable to the Knox County Jail \nIn Maine, the specific standards pursuant to which strip searches may be \nundertaken in correctional facilities come from the Attorney General.  See 5 M.R.S.A. \n§200-G(1)(2002) (directs the Attorney General to develop rules governing strip searches \nand body cavity searches).  The Attorney General’s Rules for Strip Searches define a \nstrip search as “a search during which the arrestee’s body surface, including an arrestee’s \nanal cavity and a female arrestee’s vaginal cavity and breasts, is visually inspected.”   \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 10; Defendants’ Ex. 58.2  The Attorney General’s “Rules for Strip \nSearches, Mouth Searches and Body Cavity Searches of Arrestees” provides, in relevant \npart: \n                                                 \n \n2 There have been no substantive changes to the Attorney General's Rules since they were created in 1986.  \nHinckley Depo. at 42.   \n  2\n\n1. Strip searches and mouth search.  An arrestee may be subjected to a \nstrip search and mouth search if any one of the following preconditions for \nsuch searches exists: \n \nA. Probable cause and warrant. …. \n \nB. Contact with inmates of a detention facility-arrestee for murder \nor a Class A, B, or C crime.  An arrestee for murder or a Class A, \nB, or C crime, or a corresponding juvenile offense, may be \nsubjected to a strip search and mouth search if such arrestee is \nabout to come into contact with any inmate of a detention facility. \n \nC. Contact with inmates of a detention facility – all other arrestees.  \nAn arrestee for other than murder or a Class A, B, or C crime, or \ncorresponding juvenile offense, may be subjected to a strip search \nand mouth search if \n \n1) the law enforcement officer authorizing such search has \nreasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is \nconcealing on or inside his body a weapon, contraband, or \nevidence of a crime, and \n \n2) the arrestee is about to come into contact with any \ninmates of a detention facility.  Reasonable suspicion may \nbe based on such factors as the nature of the offense for \nwhich the arrestee is arrested, the nature of offenses for \nwhich the arrestee has previously been arrested, the \narrestee’s appearance, and the arrestee’s conduct.  \n \nDefendants’ Ex. 58.  The Standard, which the Department of Corrections applies for strip \nsearches, provides: \n \nD.22.  Strip searches shall be conducted in compliance with the rules \npromulgated by the Maine Attorney General under 5 MRSA, Section \n200G.  At a minimum, strip searches shall: \n \na. Be conducted only by, and in the presence of, staff of the same \nsex as the inmate; \n \nb. Be conducted in private and in a manner that preserves the \ndignity of the inmate; \n \nc. At the time of arrest or admission to the facility, may conduct a \nstrip search when a pre-trial inmate charged or held for murder, or \na Class A, B, or C offense; \n \n  3\n\nd. At the time of arrest or admission to a facility, not conduct a \nstrip search of a pre-trial inmate charged with a Class D, E or other \nmisdemeanor offense unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that an inmate is concealing contraband and is about to \ncome into contact with inmates of the facility; \n \ne. In the case of an inmate taken into custody for execution of a \nsentence or already an inmate of a detention facility, be subject to \nstrip search at any time, to include when the inmate enters or \nleaves a security perimeter; \n \nf. All strip searches conducted at the time of arrest or admission \nshall be recorded and include at a minimum: \n \n1. Name of the inmate and the staff person conducting the \nstrip search and other persons present; \n \n2. In the case where required under 5 MRSA, Section \n200G, justification for the strip search. \n     \nDefendants’ Ex. 57.   \nMaine law requires that “Each strip search or body cavity search shall be recorded \nin a log kept by the Department of Public Safety, sheriff's department or police \ndepartment indicating the person who ordered the search, the name of the arrestee and the \nparts of the body searched.”  5 M.R.S.A. § 200-G(2)(D).  With respect to record keeping \nthe Attorney General’s Rules provide: \nEach strip search, mouth search, and body cavity search of an arrestee \nshall be recorded in a log kept by the law enforcement agency whose \nofficers were involved in the search. \n \nThe log shall indicate the name of the officer who ordered the search, the \nname of the officer or medically trained personnel who conducted the \nsearch, the names of the officers present at the search, the name of the \narrestee, the parts of the body searched, and the justification or \njustifications for the search, e.g., (1) search warrant, (2) exigent \ncircumstances and probable cause, (3) consent, (4) contact of arrestee for \nmurder, a Class A, B, or C crime, or corresponding juvenile offense, with \ninmates of a detention facility, or (5) reasonable suspicion combined with \ncontact of arrestee for other than murder, a Class A, B, or C crime, or \ncorresponding juvenile offense, with inmates of a detention facility.  \n  4\n\nWhere the justification for a warrantless search is based on the existence \nof probable cause or reasonable suspicion, such probable cause or \nreasonable suspicion shall be summarized in the log.  \n \nDefendants’ Ex. 58.   \n  \nB. Knox County Jail and Sheriff Davey’s Policies on Strip Searches \nDaniel Davey is the elected Sheriff of Knox County in 1985 and has served as \nSheriff continually since then.  Davey Aff. ¶ 1.  As Sheriff of Knox County, Mr. Davey \nhas final decision-making authority with respect to all policy and operational matters at \nthe Knox County Jail.  Davey Aff. ¶ 2.  Officially established jail policies and procedures \nare generally drafted by the Jail Administrator, and then provided to Sheriff Davey for \napproval.  Davey Aff. ¶ 2.  All jail policies are also provided to the Department of \nCorrections for approval.  Id.  Sheriff Davey is the only individual at the Knox County \nJail with the ability to make final decisions regarding the implementation of a jail policy \nor procedure.  Id.   \nKnox County Jail Policy D-220 entitled “Search Procedures” was revised in \nJanuary 1994, and provided in relevant part: \nProcedure A Search Procedures – General \n     \nBody searches will be performed on inmates in the least degrading \nmanner by corrections officers prior to beginning the admission \nprocess.  The officer performing the search will: \n \nStrip search all incoming inmates prior to placement in the \ngeneral population; \n \n…. \n \n  …. \n \nProcedure C Inmate Strip Search \n \n  5\n\nDefinition: A strip search is any unclothed search during which the \ninmate’s body surface and cavities are visually inspected, with \nlifting or moving of body parts done by the individual being \nsearched. \n \nThe intake Officer will conduct a strip search and mouth search on \nany inmate admitted to the facility who is: \n \nUnable to bail on charges. \n \nCharged with murder, or Class A, B or C crimes whether \nthe individual is an adult or juvenile. \n \nAllowed contact with any other inmate in the jail. \n \nExceptions: If an officer has reasonable suspicion to believe an \ninmate is concealing on or inside his/her body a weapon, \ncontraband or evidence of a crime. \n \nDefendants’ Ex. 52. \n1. 1994 Department of Corrections Policy Review and Jail Inspection \nIn May of 1994, the Department of Corrections conducted a review of Section D \nof the Knox County Jail Policy and Procedure Manual.  The review was conducted by \nMaine Jail Inspector John Hinckley.  Davey Aff. ¶ 7; Affidavit of Raymond Voyer ¶ 2.  \nThe policy review informed Sheriff Davey that Policy D-220, pertaining to body \nsearches, needed to be revised to comply with the Attorney General’s Rules for searches.  \nDavey Aff. ¶ 7; Voyer Aff. ¶¶ 3, 4; Defendants’ Ex. 55.  In September, October, and \nNovember of 1994, the Department of Corrections undertook an inspection of the Knox \nCounty Jail.  Mr. Hinckley, conducted that inspection and, during that inspection, Lt. \nCathy Wyman indicated to Mr. Hinckley that Knox County strip searched all the \ndetainees.  Hinckley Depo. at 80, 124; Defendants’ Ex. 59 (“While it appears that this \nfacility is in partial compliance, based on policy and staff statements, all inmates are \nbeing strip searched if they are to be housed.  This is in violation of D.22.d.”).   \n  6\n\nA revised Knox County Policy D-220 was approved by the Department of \nCorrections and went into effect in October of 1994.  Defendants’ Ex. 53.  In relevant \npart, the new search procedure provided: \nProcedure A Search Procedures – General  \n \nBody searches will be performed in the least degrading manner by \ncorrections officers prior to the admission process.  The officer \nperforming the search will ensure that: \n…. \n \nStrip searches will be conducted only on inmates brought in on a \nfelony charge (A, B or C crime) or if the officer(s) have reasonable \nsuspicion that contraband, i.e., a weapon, drugs or evidence of a \ncrime may be concealed under their clothing. \n…. \n \n  …. \n \nProcedure C Inmate Strip Search \n \nDefinition: A strip search is any unclothed search during which the \ninmate’s body surfaces and cavities are visually inspected, with the \nlifting or moving of body parts done by the individual being \nsearched; all clothing items of said individual will also be searched \nthoroughly in the process.  Strip searches will be performed inside \nthe Booking area in the shower stall after a pat search has first \nbeen done before admitting the detainee beyond the 110E door. \n \n1. The intake (Booking) Officer will conduct a strip search of any \ninmate admitted to the facility who is: \n \na. Charged with murder, or a Class A, B or C crime and, \n \nb. unable to bail on charges, and, \n \nc. before coming in contact with any other inmate. \n \n  7\n\nDefendants’ Ex. 53.  Jail Administrator Raymond Voyer3 was instructed that the new \npolicy be included in the Policy and Procedure Manual, and that all corrections staff be \ntrained in the policy and requirement to implement it. Davey Aff. ¶ 10; Voyer Aff. ¶ 13. \nIn December of 1994, the Department of Corrections issued a report which \nSheriff Davey and Mr. Voyer received.  Defendants’ Ex. 59; Davey Aff. ¶ 11; Voyer Aff. \n¶ 6.  The report identified certain areas of non-compliance with the Department of \nCorrections Standards.4  Relevant to the issues raised in this case, the report found that \nDepartment of Corrections Standards and Attorney General’s Rules for strip searches \nwere being violated because “based on policy and staff statements, all inmates are being \nstrip searched if they are housed.”  Defendants’ Ex. 59 at 31; Davey Aff. ¶ 11; Voyer Aff. \n¶ 6; Hinckley Depo. at 77, 79; Plaintiffs’ Ex.10, Attorney General's Rules and \nRegulations.  As a result of the 1994 policy review and the jail inspection, Sheriff Davey \ninstructed Mr. Voyer to revise Policy D-220 to comply with Department of Corrections \nStandards and the Attorney General’s Rules.  Davey Aff. ¶ 9; Voyer Aff. ¶ 5.  Mr. Voyer \nmade revisions and Sheriff Davey approved them.  Id.   \nA few months later, Mr. Voyer made further revisions to both Policy C-120 and \nD-220, and in January 1995 Sheriff Davey approved them.  Defendants’ Exs. 48, 54; \nVoyer Aff. ¶ 12; Davey Aff. ¶ 15.  Policy C-120 –“Admission Procedures - Inmates Not \nBailed” provides in relevant part:  \nThe following admissions procedures are not required to be completed on \ninmates being admitted and immediately released.  Procedures, as outlined \n                                                 \n \n3 Mr. Voyer held the position of Knox County Jail Administrator from sometime in 1989 until May of \n1996.  Voyer Aff. ¶ 1.  \n \n4 Since inspection of the jail began in September 1994, some of the information included in the 1994 Jail \nInspection Report may have occurred before Knox County Policy D-220 was revised in October 1994.  \n  8\n\nbelow, are necessary to safely admit inmates who are not going to make \nbail, while protecting their rights. \n \nPROCEDURE A  Strip Search/Decontamination \n \n1. Strip searches will be conducted on pre-trial inmates at the time of \narrest or admission to the facility if they are charged or held for murder or \na class A, B or C crime[]; they will be conducted only under the following \nconditions: \n \na. They shall be conducted only by, and in the presence of, staff of \nthe same sex as the inmate. \n \n  b. They shall be recorded and include at a minimum: \n \n    (1)  Name of inmate. \n    (2)  Name of staff person doing the search. \n    (3)  Name of any other persons present. \n(4)  Justification for search if required under 5 MRSA, \nSection 200G. \n \n2. Strip searches will also be conducted on inmates taken into custody for \nexecution of a sentence or already an inmate of a detention facility, to \ninclude when the inmate(s) enter or leave a security perimeter. \n \n3. Strip searches will NOT be conducted at the time of arrest or admission \non pre-trial inmates charged with a class D, E, or other misdemeanor \noffense unless the officer has REASONABLE SUSPICION to believe that \nan inmate is concealing contraband and is about to come in contact with \nother inmates of the facility. \n \nDefendants’ Ex. 48.  Policy D-220 –“Search Procedures” became effective January 1995 \nand provides, in relevant part: \nContraband in a correctional facility creates a danger to staff, visitors and \nresidents.  In an effort to stem the flow of contraband, facility \nshakedowns, searches of common and living areas will be performed, in \naddition to body searches of inmates in accordance with the Maine State \nAttorney General’s Rules for Searches and the Maine Jail Standards. \n \nOfficers must act in a professional manner while performing pat and strip \nsearches and do them in the least degrading manner possible. \n \nPROCEDURE A  Search Procedures, General \n \n  9\n\n1. Body searches will be performed in the least degrading manner by \ncorrections officers prior to the admission process.  The officer performing \nthe search will ensure that: \n \na. Pat search all detainees brought into the jail between the 105E \nand 110E doors before the 110E door is opened and they are \nbrought in to Booking. \n \nb. Strip searches will be conducted only on inmates brought in on  \nfelony charge (A, B, or C crime) or if the officer(s) have \nreasonable suspicion that contraband, i.e., a weapon, drugs, or \nevidence of a crime may be concealed under their clothing. \n \nc. All inmates being transported will be pat searched; they may be \nstrip searched if probable cause exists to believe that the safety of \nthe officers, the inmates and/or the public could be in jeopardy. \n \nd. The following information is recorded in the Daily Log (Shift \nActivity Log). \n \n    (1)  Date, time and location of search. \n    (2)  Name of the inmate(s). \n    (3)  Any items seized. \n    (4)  Name(s) of Officer(s) performing the search. \n \ne. Incident reports are prepared and submitted if any contraband is \nfound. \n \nf. Searches are performed by persons of the same gender as the \nperson(s) being searched. \n \n  …. \n \nPROCEDURE C  Inmate Strip Search \n \nDEFINITION:  A strip search is any unclothed search during which \nthe inmate’s body surfaces and cavities are visually \ninspected, with the lifting or moving of body parts \ndone by the individual being searched; all clothing \nitems of said individual will also be searched \nthoroughly in the process.  Strip searches will be \nperformed inside the Booking area in the shower \nstall after a pat search has first been done before \nadmitting the detainee beyond the 110E door. \n \n  10\n\n1. The Intake (Booking) Officer will conduct a strip search of any \ninmate admitted to the facility who is: \n \n      a. Charged with murder, or a Class A, B, or C crime and, \n \n      b. Unable to bail on charges, and, \n \n      c. Before coming in contact with any other inmate. \n \nd. A strip search may also be performed for the safety of \nthe staff and inmate population and security of the facility \nwhen probable cause exists to believe that the Inmate in \nquestion may be concealing contraband and/or weapons on \nhis/her person and a pat search has not turned up anything. \n \n2. The strip search must be conducted by an officer of the same sex \nas the inmate, with the following rules observed: \n \na. Allowing only those officer personnel of the same gender who \nare necessary to be present during the search for the following \nreasons: \n \n    (1)  Protection. \n    (2)  Witnessing removal of contraband or evidence of a crime. \n    (3)  Other legitimate law enforcement purpose. \n \nDefendants’ Ex. 54.  When Policy C-120 and D-220 were made effective in January of \n1995 they were placed in the Policy and Procedure Manual.5  Davey Aff. ¶ 16.  These \npolicies clearly prohibit strip searches of misdemeanor detainees without reasonable \nsuspicion.  Jail Administrator Voyer was instructed to ensure that correctional officers \nwere provided with the revised policy and were given training in the implementation of \nthe policies.  Id.  In describing the corrective action planned or taken, Sheriff Davey, \ntogether with Mr. Voyer, responded to the Department of Corrections Statement of \nDeficiencies for Standard D-22 stating: “The search policy has been clarified for all \n                                                 \n \n5 Both the January 1995 revisions of Policy C-120 and Policy D-220 were again reviewed in January of \n1996.  Davey Aff. ¶ 16.  It does not appear that any further changes were made to the policies in 1996. \n  11\n\ncorrectional staffers: strip searches are no longer conducted except as specified in the \nstandards.”  Defendants’ Ex. 60; Hinckley Depo. at 94; Davey Aff. ¶12; Voyer Aff. ¶ 7.    \n2. 2000 Department of Corrections Jail Inspection \nIn August and September of 2000, the Department of Corrections conducted \nanother inspection of the Knox County Jail.  Davey Aff. ¶ 17.  When he inspected the \nKnox County Jail again in 2000, Mr. Hinckley found that the jail was not in compliance \nwith Department of Correction Standard on strip searches.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 14, 2000 \nBiennial Inspection Report of Knox County Jail; Hinckley Depo. at 95, 119-120.  During \nthe 2000 Jail Inspection, two different Knox County Jail employees interviewed by Mr. \nHinckley verified that Knox County was strip searching every detainee.6  Hinckley Depo. \nat 97.  Moreover, although in some instances Knox County may have relied on the charge \nitself as the basis for the strip search, the report finds that the specific justification for \nstrip searches required by the Attorney General's Rules, was not being documented by \nKnox County.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 14, 2000, Biennial Inspection Report of Knox County Jail; \nHinckley Depo. at 99, 100.   \nIn October of 2000, the Department of Corrections issued a report identifying \nareas of non-compliance regarding its inspection of the Knox County Jail.  Defendants’ \nEx. 61; Davey Aff. ¶ 17.  According to the report and relevant to this case, the jail was \nnot in compliance with the Department of Corrections Standard on strip searches \n                                                 \n \n6 In argument, and without any evidentiary support, Defendants suggest that when interviewed by Inspector \nHinckley, the corrections officers may have understood the term “strip search” to be a detainee disrobing \nbut not viewed by the corrections officer.  Under Maine law, the Attorney General’s Rules, and Knox \nCounty policies and procedures, the definition of the term “strip search” is clear and includes viewing the \ndetainee’s unclothed body and inspecting body cavities.  The record indicates that corrections officers at \nthe Knox County Jail are trained in the definition as well as the procedure for conducting a strip search \nwhen initially hired.  Defendants’ Ex. 47.  In the absence of any evidentiary indication by a corrections \nofficer that they understood the term “strip search” to be other than as it is defined in Maine law, the Court \nwill disregard this suggestion.   \n  12\n\nbecause, “based on statements from staff, all inmates were being strip searched regardless \nof the crime if they are to be housed.”  Defendants’ Ex. 61; Davey Aff. ¶ 17.  In February \n2001, Sheriff Davey prepared a response to the finding of non-compliance with Standard \nD.22.d and stated that “strip searches of Class D and E will NOT take place except in \nthose instances described in the standard.”  Defendants’ Ex. 62 (emphasis in original); \nDavey Aff. ¶ 18.  \n  After the 2000 Jail inspection, Jail Administrator Richard Robbins7 developed a \nprocedure for implementing Policy C-120 with respect to detainees charged with Class D \nand E crimes.  The procedure for implementing Policy C-120 was approved by Sheriff \nDavey and became effective in May 2001, providing that detainees charged with \nmisdemeanors “will be pat searched.”  Defendants’ Ex. 49 (emphasis in original); Davey \nAff. ¶ 20.  The only mention of strip search is in a section dealing with metal detector \nalerts where the procedure states “[a]rticulable suspicion is justification for strip search.”  \nDefendants’ Ex. 49.  At the same time, Jail Administrator Robbins also developed a \nspecific and detailed “Daily Activity Schedule for Designated Housing for Pre-\nArraignment Detainees Class D and E Section 128/cells 130, 131, and 132.”  Defendants’ \nEx. 50.  This procedural memorandum indicated that “[a]ll detainees held in this section \nHAVE NOT been strip searched; they will not have contact with each other for security \nreasons.”  Defendants’ Ex. 50 (emphasis in original); Davey Aff. ¶ 22.   \n                                                 \n \n7 Mr. Robbins’ affidavit states that he began his tenure as Jail Administrator on December 11, 2001, and \nwas the Jail Administrator of the Knox County Jail until at least March 2003.  Affidavit of Richard Robbins \n(March 28, 2003) ¶ 1.  However, it appears that Mr. Robbins was serving as Jail Administrator when he \napproved the memorandum entitled “Procedure for Policy D-120 Pre-Arraingment D & E Detainees” in \nMay 2001.   \n  13\n\nIn May 2001, after Knox County settled a law suit alleging unconstitutional strip \nsearches, Mr. Robbins wrote a memorandum to the chiefs of the local police departments \nstating: \n1. As you, no doubt, know, the County recently settled a law suit, which \ncharged that Jail staff conducting [sic] an inappropriate strip search in \n1994. \n \n2. As a consequence of the suit, an extensive and in-depth review of policy \nand procedure regarding strip searches was conducted by the \nadministration of the Knox County Jail.  You may, also, recall that in the \npast staff at the Jail were occasionally requested to conduct a strip search \nof an arrestee at the request of the arresting agency.  On such occasions a \nwritten authorization/request was executed by the arresting officer. \n \n3. Please be advised that given the resolution of the law suit (Miller v. \nKnox County et al), the Jail will no longer conduct a strip search of those \narrested and charged with Class D and/or Class E offenses at the request \nof the arresting officers (for the purpose of discovering evidence).  If an \narresting officer desires to have an arrestee strip searched for the purpose \nof discovering evidence, the search must take place prior to admission to \nthe Jail. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 23 (emphasis added).  In March of 2002, Jail Administrator Robbins issued \na memorandum to all staff entitled “Management of Non-Searched Inmates,” which \nstates: \n[t]he purpose of the P&P re: non-search inmates is to minimize, as \nmuch as possible, the opportunities for such inmates to mix among \nthemselves or the general population.  The goal is intended to \nreduce liability for the County since we cannot be assured that \ncontraband is not in possession of such inmates absent a strip \nsearch, which the First Circuit Court has prohibited without \narticulable suspicion.  \n  \nDefendants’ Ex. 51; Davey Aff. ¶ 23.     \nLater, in connection with the investigation of this law suit, Mr. Robbins wrote an \nintradepartmental memorandum which provides: \n  14\n\n1. Based on the notation in the Lynette ROBINSON inmate file [12/22/00 \n@ 0702] that C/O M. Kenney had strip searched inmate ROBINSON, I \ninterviewed C/O Kenney this date. \n \n2. In response to my inquiry C/O Kenney explained her understanding of \nthe current strip search policy, identifying felony PT inmates, sentenced \ninmates (regardless of class) and misdemeanor PT inmates based upon \narticulable suspicion were subject to strip search. \n \n3. C/O Kenney advised that she had been employed at the facility for \napproximately 5 years and that prior to the procedural changes adopted \nin February 2001, it was her understanding that anyone, regardless of \ncrime class was to be stripped searched if they were admitted to the \ngeneral population.  She further advised that it was her recollection that \nshe was trained to conduct strip searches of any inmate admitted to \ngeneral population during her classroom training and job shadowing, \nalbeit she did not recall who presented that segment of her training.  She \nstated that she had no recollection of the strip search policy developed and \nwritten by (then) jail administrator Raymond Voyer. \n \n4. I spoke with Sgt. Jay Costigan and R/O Cheryl Daniello this date \nregarding the strip search policy and practice.  Both indicated that they \nrecalled a discussion several years ago in which the Voyer and D.O.C. \npolicies were mentioned and that the decision was made by someone \n(unidentified) to disregard the applicable policy and standard and \ncontinue to search all inmates, regardless of crime class, if they were to be \nadmitted to the general population.  The justification, as they recalled, was \nsafety and security of the facility.  Sgt. Costigan stated that he doesn’t \nrecall ever seeing or receiving a copy of the Voyer strip search policy. \n \n5. Since the policy was written by Mr. Voyer in his capacity as jail \nadministrator, and both Sgt. Costigan and R/O Daniello suggested that a \nconscious decision was made to disregard the policy, it is reasonable to \nbelieve that the ONLY person that could have issued such an advisory to \ndisregard the policy that would have had a compulsory effect on staff \nwould have been Lt. Wyman.  As program officer, Lt. Gardner would \nhave lacked such authority.   \n \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 20 (emphasis added).  A few days later, Mr. Robbins penned another \nmemorandum stating: \n \n1. Based on the notation in the Lynette ROBINSON inmate file [12/22/00 \n@0702] that C/O M. Kenney had strip searched Inmate ROBINSON, I \ninterviewed C/O Kenney on 2/14/03. \n \n  15\n\n2. During the course of the interview C/O Kenney mentioned that she was \ntrained to strip search everyone that was not going to be admitted to bail.  \nShe mentioned that C/O Dane Winslow was in her training class and \nwould, therefore, advise that he was trained in the same way. \n \n3. I interviewed C/O Winslow in my office on 2/14/03 at approximately \n1615 hours.  I asked C/O Winslow what his understanding of the current \nstrip search policy was.  He explained his understanding, which appeared \nto be correct except that he did not believe that any misdemeanor PT \ninmate could be strip searched. \n \n4. I asked C/O Winslow what his training had been when he first joined \nthe agency.  He confirmed the representation of C/O Kenney, viz., that he \nhad been trained to strip search any inmate that was not admitted to bail \nregardless of crime class.  He could not recall who taught the unit, nor \nwas he aware that Maj. Raymond Voyer, former jail administrator, had \nwritten an agency policy that prohibited strip searches of misdemeanor PT \narrestees.  In response to my request C/O Winslow indicated that he would \nattempt to locate his training materials in order to identify who taught the \nstrip search unit. \n \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 20 (emphasis added).    \nC. Evidence of Strip Searches Conducted at the Knox County Jail \nOn February 7, 2001, at approximately 5:05 p.m., Plaintiff Laurie Tardiff was \narrested at her residence in Rockland, Maine, by a Rockland Police Officer.  Ms. Tardiff \nwas arrested pursuant to a warrant for tampering with a witness – a Class C felony \ncharge.  See 17-A § 454(1)(A)(2); Simmons Aff. ¶ 6; Middaugh Aff. ¶¶ 2, 3; Defendants’ \nExs. 63-65; Affidavit of Laurie Tardiff at ¶ 3.  Prior to leaving home, she was required to \nempty her pockets in front of the arresting officer.  Tardiff Aff. ¶ 5.  Ms. Tardiff was \ntaken to the Knox County Jail, and on her arrival, was booked in the intake area.  Tardiff \nAff. ¶ 6.  After being booked, Ms. Tardiff was taken to a shower area and Correction \nOfficer Linda Simmons ordered her to remove her clothing for inspection.8  Tardiff Aff. ¶ \n                                                 \n \n8 The shower room in the booking area of the Knox County jail is used exclusively for conducting strip \nsearches.  Robbins Depo. at 57.  The shower room where the strip searches take place is L-shaped and \n  16\n\n15.  After her clothing was removed, Ms. Tardiff was strip searched.9  Tardiff Aff. ¶ 22-\n23.  Once this process was completed, Ms. Tardiff was given jail clothing and allowed to \ndress.  Simmons Aff. ¶¶ 6-12; Defendants’ Ex. 28.  Ms. Tardiff was then placed in a cell.  \nThe Intake/Release Log for February 7, 2001, omits reference to Ms. Tardiff's strip \nsearch.  Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2.     \nOver the relevant class period, six separate months of the Knox County Jail’s \nIntake/Release Logs and Inmate Daily Logs,10 were randomly selected to create a sample \nof potential class members: January 1997, February 1998, November 1999, October \n2000, July 2001, and August 2002.  Ward Aff. ¶¶ 1-8.  During these six sample months at \nleast seventeen persons charged with various Class E crimes were strip searched without \nreasonable suspicion.11  Ex. A of Ward Aff.; Defendants’ Ex. 67.  During these six \nsample months at least nine persons charged with Class D OUI were strip searched \nwithout reasonable suspicion.12  Ward Aff. ¶¶ 21, 22; Ex. B of Ward Aff.; Defendants’ \n                                                                                                                                                 \nadjacent to the small property room in the booking area.  Robbins Depo. at 57.  It is not clear from the \nrecord whether there is a curtain over the shower stall or over the entry into the shower room or both.  In \nany case, the record presents an issue of fact as to whether other persons passing the shower room can view \nthe individual being strip searched.  Colson Affidavit ¶ 12; Tardiff Aff. ¶¶ 19-20; Pratt Aff. ¶ 13.   \n \n9 Although Officer Simmons states that she performed the strip search of Ms. Tardiff as she had been \ntrained, Simmons Aff. ¶ 7, and the Knox County Jail standard procedures require a visual body cavity \ninspection be performed by the corrections officer when conducting a strip search, Defendants’ Ex. 54, \nOfficer Simmons disputes Ms. Tardiff’s claim that she completed a visual body cavity inspection of Ms. \nTardiff, Simmons Aff. ¶ 11; Tardiff Aff. ¶ 22.  Officer Simmons does admit that she had Ms. Tardiff squat \nand cough.  Simmons Aff. ¶ 11; Robbins Depo. at 150;   \n \n10 If a notation that a detainee was strip searched was made, it was made in the Intake/Release Log or the \nDaily Log. \n \n11 During these six sample months Plaintiffs contend that thirty-four persons charged with various Class E \ncrimes were strip searched without reasonable suspicion.  Exhibit A of Ward Aff.  Defendants respond that \nthirteen of the Class E misdemeanants were “searched” but not “strip searched” and four were sentenced \ninmates not part of the class.  Affidavit of Donna Campbell ¶¶ 7-9.  For purposes of summary judgment, \nthe Court will consider only the seventeen arrestees that the parties agree upon as having been strip \nsearched.    \n \n  17\n\nEx. 68.  In addition, during these six sample months at least six persons charged with \nmiscellaneous Class D misdemeanors were strip searched without reasonable suspicion.13  \nWard Aff. ¶ 16; Ex. C of Ward Aff.; Defendants’ Ex. 69.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nSummary judgment is appropriate only if the record shows “that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \nas a matter of law.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); United States Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr. Co., \n315 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2002).  “In this regard, ‘material’ means that a contested fact has \nthe potential to change the outcome of the suit under the governing law if the dispute over \nit is resolved favorably to the nonmovant.  By like token, ‘genuine’ means that ‘the \nevidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of \nthe nonmoving party.’”  Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 93-94 (1st Cir.2001) \n(quoting McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir.1995)).  The \nparty moving for summary judgment must demonstrate an absence of evidence to support \nthe nonmoving party's case.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, \n91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  In determining whether this burden is met, the court must view \nthe record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and give that party the \nbenefit of all reasonable inferences in its favor.  Nicolo v. Philip Morris, Inc., 201 F.3d \n                                                                                                                                                 \n12 During the six sample months Plaintiffs contend that twenty-four Class \"D\" OUI's were strip searched \nwithout articulable suspicion.  Ward Aff. ¶¶ 21, 22 and Exhibit B of Ward Aff.  Defendants respond that \nsix of the Class D OUI misdemeanants were “searched” but not “strip searched” and ten were sentenced \ninmates not part of the class.  Campbell Aff. ¶¶ 3-6.  For purposes of summary judgment, the Court will \nconsider only the nine arrestees that the parties agree upon as having been strip searched.    \n \n13 During the six sample months Plaintiffs contend that twenty-one Class \"D\" misdemeanants were strip \nsearched without reasonable suspicion.  Ward Aff. ¶ 16 and Exhibit C of Ward Aff.  Defendants respond \nthat six of the Class D misdemeanants from this list were “searched” but not “strip searched,” seven were \nsentenced inmates not part of the class, and two were not searched.  Campbell Aff. ¶¶ 10-13.  For purposes \nof summary judgment, the Court will consider only the six arrestees that the parties agree upon as having \nbeen strip searched.  \n   \n  18\n\n29, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).  Once the moving party has made a preliminary showing that no \ngenuine issue of material fact exists, the nonmovant must “produce specific facts, in \nsuitable evidentiary form, to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.”  Triangle \nTrading Co. v. Robroy Indus., Inc., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation and internal \npunctuation omitted); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).  “As to any essential factual element of its \nclaim on which the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial, its failure to come \nforward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary \njudgment to the moving party.”  In re Spigel, 260 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation and \ninternal punctuation omitted).  \nA. MUNICIPAL LIABILITY \nA claim under section 1983 requires the plaintiff to show the deprivation of a \nfederally secured right by a person acting under color of state law.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; \nsee also Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1998).  A municipality cannot be \nheld liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for constitutional deprivations unless the \nunconstitutional conduct occurred as a result of the implementation or execution of a \nmunicipal policy or custom.  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. \n658, 690-91, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).  As with any other tort claim, \nthere must be a showing in a section 1983 action of “a direct causal link” between the \nmunicipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation.  Canton v. Harris, \n489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S. Ct. 1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989).   \nIn applying Monell, courts have struggled to determine just which sorts of \nmunicipal wrongdoing may properly be said to have caused constitutional violations.  See \nid. (noting that this inquiry has left the Supreme Court \"deeply divided\").  A clear basis \n  19\n\nfor municipal liability is, however, the municipality’s enforcement of an unconstitutional \nregulation, ordinance, or written policy.  See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. \n469, 480, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1986).  A “policy” may be established by \neither a policy or decision adopted by the municipality or a single act of a municipal \nofficial with final policymaking authority.  See St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, \n124, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988).  Another basis for municipal liability arises \nout of an unconstitutional “custom or practice” if it is “so well settled and widespread \nthat the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or \nconstructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.”  Bordanaro v. McLeod, \n871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir. 1989).  Unlike a “policy,” which comes into existence \nbecause of the top down affirmative decision of a policymaker, a “custom or practice” \ndevelops from the bottom up.  Thus, the liability of the municipality for custom-based \nconstitutional violations derives not from its creation of the custom, but from its tolerance \nof or acquiescence in it.  Id. \n1. The Constitutionality of the Policy of Strip Searching All  \nDetainees Charged with a Non-Violent, Non-Weapon, or Non-Drug Felony \n \nPlaintiffs contend that Knox County’s written policy of strip searching all felony \ndetainees without reasonable suspicion is unconstitutional.  Defendants respond that the \nfelony charge itself provides the justification to perform a strip search.  Because the class \nof Plaintiffs certified in this case include only those detainees charged with a non-violent, \nnon-weapon, non-drug felony, it is not necessary for the Court to decide the issue of \nwhether any felony charge alone provides a constitutional basis upon which to strip \nsearch a detainee.  Rather the Court will consider the narrower question of whether a \n  20\n\ndetainee charged with a non-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felony can be \nconstitutionally strip searched based on the charge alone.    \nAlmost twenty-five years ago the Supreme Court laid out a balancing test under \nthe Fourth Amendment to determine the reasonableness of a search which requires the \nweighing of the “need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails.”  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 \n(1979).  Specifically, this balancing test requires courts to “consider the scope of the \nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, \nand the place in which it is conducted.”  Id.  In applying the Bell test in the context of \nmisdemeanor detainees, the First Circuit concluded that strip and visual body cavity \nsearches “must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is \nconcealing contraband or weapons.”  Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).  See \nalso Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 929 (1st Cir. 1996)(reasonable suspicion standard is \nthe appropriate one for justifying strip searches of prison visitors); United States v. \nUricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir. 1991)(reasonable suspicion standard is \nthe appropriate one for justifying strip searches non-routine border searches).  In the \nyears following Swain, the First Circuit has reaffirmed that strip searches of persons \narrested on a misdemeanor charge and brought to a local jail for booking must be \njustified by individualized reasonable suspicion of concealed weapons or contraband.  \nSee Wood v. Hancock County, 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2003); Roberts v. Rhode Island, \n239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001); Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12-13 (1st Cir. \n2000); see also Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 37 (1st Cir. 2003)(en banc)(equally \ndivided court affirmed district court’s grant of qualified immunity to defendants based on \n  21\n\nconclusion that unlawfulness of strip search of misdemeanants housed at a state’s \nmaximum security prison without particularized suspicion was not clearly established).   \nThe record in this case establishes that pursuant to Knox County’s written policy \ncorrections officers at the Knox County Jail routinely strip search newly-arrived felony \narrestees regardless of the charge.  The jail policies do not differentiate between violent \nfelonies and other non-violent, non-weapon, or non-drug Class “C” crimes.  Robbins \nDepo. at 12.  Under Maine law, there are some felony crimes that do not involve \nviolence, weapons, or drugs.  For example, Maine’s “Operating Under the Influence” \nstatute provides a Class C felony.  See 29-A M.R.S.A. § 2411.  It cannot be understood \nthat being accused of operating under the influence would automatically provide \nreasonable suspicion to believe that the detainee was concealing contraband on or in their \nbody.   \nWhile the goal of preventing the entry of contraband into a local jail is justifiable \nfrom the standpoint of safety and security, such justification alone can not sustain a \npolicy or practice of strip searching individuals without reasonable suspicion.  See Wood, \n89 F.3d at 928 (“[A] strip search can hardly be characterized as a routine procedure or as \na minimally intrusive means of maintaining prison security.  Indeed, ‘a strip search, by its \nvery nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense \nto the dignity of the individual.’”)(internal quotations omitted).   Defendants offer no \nevidence or precedent that would justify a policy for searching all detainees charged with \nnon-violent, non-weapon, or non-drug felonies.  Although Defendants assert that the \nreason for the policy is to prevent the entry of contraband into the facility, they do not \nargue that the Knox County Jail is frequently confronted with contraband smuggled into \n  22\n\nthe Knox County Jail.  There is no evidence that detainees have typically concealed \ncontraband or weapons in their bodies in the past, let alone that the felony detainees are \nresponsible for a greater amount of contraband than misdemeanor detainees.  Defendants’ \nrely on three incident reports from the Knox County Jail all arising out of the August \n2002 two-day detainment of a single felony arrestee named Jodi Young.  Defendants’ \nExs. 71, 72, 73.  Each report indicates that contraband was discovered either in her cell or \non her person.  Id.  However, it is not determinable from the record whether she was \ncharged with a felony involving violence, a weapon or drugs.  Since it is not known on \nwhat type of felony charge she was detained, evidence of her possession of contraband \nwhile at the Knox County Jail is not necessarily probative of the justification for strip \nsearching all felony detainees.  The evidentiary record, contrary to Defendants’ assertion, \ndoes not support a conclusion that a non-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felony charge \nautomatically provides reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search.   \nDefendants assert that in developing their policy they relied on the Attorney \nGeneral’s Rules and Department of Corrections Standards, which permit the strip search \nof all felony arrestees without reasonable suspicion.  This argument, however, goes only \nto the question of Knox County’s good faith in adopting those non-mandatory rules and \nstandards.14  Since the County is not entitled to the benefit of a qualified immunity \ndefense, Knox County’s reliance on them does not excuse the application of an otherwise \nunlawful policy.  See Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 639, 100 S. Ct. 1398, \n                                                 \n14 Defendants assert that the Department of Corrections Standards are mandatory for all county jails.  While \nDepartment of Corrections Standards may be mandatory, the relevant provisions governing strip search \npolicy and procedure in those standards, like the Attorney General’s Regulations, merely authorize, but do \nnot require, felony detainees to be strip searched.  Defendants’ Exs. 57 and 58. \n \n  23\n\n63 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1980) (municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers as a \ndefense to section 1983 liability).   \nWhile the First Circuit has not directly addressed the appropriate test for the \nvalidity of a strip search during the booking process at a local jail and incident to a felony \narrest, this Court concludes that, with respect to detainees charged with a non-violent, \nnon-weapon, non-drug felony, the particularized reasonable suspicion test is applicable, \nrather than strip searches of all felony arrestees being authorized based solely on the fact \nthat they had been arrested on a charge categorized under state law as a felony.  Swain, \n117 F.3d at 7 (“[I]t is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip \nand visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context….”).  This conclusion is based in \npart on the First Circuit's clear statements about constitutional protections applicable to \nindividuals who are the subject of a governmentally initiated strip search.  The law in this \nCircuit does not countenance a policy permitting strip searches of all non-violent, non-\nweapon, non-drug felony detainees upon arrival at a local correctional facility simply \nbecause they stand accused of a felony.  The distinction between felony and misdemeanor \ndetainees alone fails to address the likelihood that a detainee would be concealing drugs, \nweapons, or other contraband.  See Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 14, 105 S. Ct. 1694, \n85 L. Ed. 2d 1, (1985) (“[T]he assumption that a ‘felon’ is more dangerous than a \nmisdemeanant [is] untenable.”).  Moreover, a non-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felony \ncharge fails to create a presumption of reasonable suspicion required to perform a strip \nsearch.   \nThough the crime for which a detainee is charged is an important factor for \nconsideration, it does not independently establish reasonable suspicion necessary under \n  24\n\nthe Fourth Amendment.  Officers should evaluate whether the crime charged involves \nviolence, drugs, or some other feature from which an officer could reasonably suspect \nthat an arrestee was hiding weapons or contraband as well as other factors like the \ncircumstances of the arrest and the particular characteristics of the arrestee.  When these \nfactors are considered, it is possible that the strip search of many accused felons may be \nlegitimate.  Nevertheless, strip searching all individuals charged with felony crimes that \ndo not involve violence, weapons, or drugs as part of the booking process at a local jail is \nunconstitutional.  Plaintiffs have established that corrections officers were following the \nunconstitutional policy of strip searching all felony detainees when their rights were \nviolated.  Because Knox County’s written policy of strip searching all felony detainees \ncharged with non-violent, non-weapon, or non-drug offenses is unconstitutional and that \npolicy caused the violation of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs arrested on felony \ncharges, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against \nKnox County on that part of Count I as to the existence of liability.   \n2. The Constitutionality of Knox County’s Alleged Custom \nand Practice of Strip Searching Detainees Charged with Misdemeanors \n \nPlaintiff must meet two requirements to maintain this type of section 1983 claim.  \nFirst, the custom or practice must be attributable to the municipality; i.e., it must be “so \nwell settled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be \nsaid to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the \npractice.”  Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156.  Second, the custom must have been the cause \nof and “the moving force” behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.  Id. at 1157.  \nUnder the law regarding strip searches of persons arrested on a misdemeanor charge it is \nwell established that the Fourth Amendment requires that strip and visual body cavity \n  25\n\nsearches “must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is \nconcealing contraband or weapons.”  Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.  Plaintiffs contend that Knox \nCounty has a custom and practice of routinely strip searching persons charged with minor \noffenses without articulable suspicion that they harbor contraband or weapons.  While \nDefendants deny unlawfully strip searching four proposed Plaintiffs charged with \nmisdemeanors,15 Defendants admit to strip searching a significant number of \nmisdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion during the relevant class period.  \na. Existence of Widespread Practice \nPrior to October 1994, Knox County Jail policy required corrections officers to \nstrip search all detainees brought to the facility.  Defendants’ Ex. 52.  With respect to \nmisdemeanor detainees, the revisions made to Policy D-220 in October 1994 and Policy \nC-120 in January 1995 brought those written policies in line with constitutional \nstandards.  Defendants’ Exs. 53, 48.  While Knox County Policies C-120 and D-220 have \nclearly stated, since October 1994, that misdemeanor detainees are not to be strip \nsearched without reasonable suspicion, the record presents undisputed evidence that \nsubstantial numbers of persons arrested for misdemeanor offenses were routinely strip \nsearched without reasonable suspicion at the Knox County Jail.  \nThe reports generated by the Department of Corrections following the 1994 Jail \nInspection and the 2000 Jail Inspection find, based on staff statements made at those \ntimes, that corrections officers at the jail were strip searching all detainees charged with \nmisdemeanors.  Defendants’ Exs. 59, 61.  Even before the 2000 Jail Inspection was \nconducted, Jail Administrator Robbins admits that as a result of the lawsuit Miller v. \n                                                 \n15 The four proposed Plaintiffs – Susan Winchenbach, Andrew Pratt, Lynette Dean, and Judy Carter – are \ndiscussed in section B(1)(b) of this opinion.   \n  \n  26\n\nKennebec County, 219 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2000), which was filed in this Court in April 1998, \nhe “became aware that the jail staff were not always following the policy and were, at \nleast on some occasions, conducting strip searches in violation of policy [C-120].”16  \nRobbins Aff. ¶ 6.  In 2001, Jail Administrator Robbins wrote to local police chiefs \nnotifying them that the Knox County Jail would no longer provide the service of strip \nsearching misdemeanor arrestees on “the request of arresting officers (for the purpose of \ndiscovering evidence).”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 23.    \nFurther confirmation of the existence of a widespread practice is gleaned from \nKnox County Jail’s own intradepartmental memoranda.  Two intradepartmental \nmemoranda, the subjects of each described as “Strip Search Practice Interview” written \nafter this case was filed in 2003, indicate that at least some corrections officers at the \nKnox County Jail believed that strip searching all detainees was the jail’s practice.  \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 20.  Perhaps the most strongly corroborative evidence of the existence of \nthis practice are the statements contained in the memoranda that were made by two \ncorrections officers that they were told that, for security reasons, the policy that there \nmust be reasonable suspicion to search misdemeanor detainees should be ignored.  \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 20.  Those intradepartmental memoranda establish that in 2003 \nCorrections Officers Costigan and Daniello believed that they were to search all \nmisdemeanor detainees.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20.  The record shows that from sometime in \n1998 when she was hired, until the procedural changes adopted in February 2001, \nCorrections Officer Kenney understood that anyone, regardless of crime class was to be \nstripped searched if they were admitted to the general population.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20.   \n                                                 \n16 The Court notes that Knox County was one of the named defendants in the Miller lawsuit. \n \n  27\n\nFinally, evidence of this unconstitutional practice can be easily verified from a \nreview of the daily Intake/Release Log entries.  That log establishes that based on a six-\nmonth sample during the relevant class period, Defendants strip searched at least \nseventeen persons charged with various Class E crimes without reasonable suspicion.  \nExhibit A of Ward Affidavit; Defendants’ Ex. 67.  With respect to detainees charged with \nClass D OUI, Defendants admit that during these six sample months at least nine persons \nwere strip searched without reasonable suspicion.  Affidavit of Michelle Ward ¶¶ 21, 22; \nExhibit B of Ward Affidavit; Defendants’ Ex. 68.  With respect to miscellaneous Class D \nmisdemeanor detainees, Defendants admit that during these six sample months at least \nsix persons were strip searched without reasonable suspicion.17  Ward Aff. ¶ 16; Ex. C of \nWard Aff.; Defendants’ Ex. 69.  Based on the undisputed evidence presented in the \nsummary judgment record, the record shows, without cavil, that the practice by \ncorrections officers of strip searching misdemeanor detainees was so widespread that the \npolicymaking officials of the municipality had constructive knowledge of it.  Moreover, \nthe Court concludes that Knox County personnel with policy-making authority had actual \nnotice that the corrections officers were unlawfully strip searching misdemeanor \ndetainees without reasonable suspicion. \nb. Defendants’ Failure to Take Corrective Action  \nThe Court is struck by the fact that even after the 2000 Jail Inspection Report \nclearly found that misdemeanor detainees were being routinely strip searched, there is no \n                                                 \n17 Although it is not known from the record exactly how many individuals charged with misdemeanors \nwere brought into the Knox County Jail over the six month sample in order to determine the percent of \nmisdemeanor detainees Defendants admit were strip searched, the record is convincing that, based on the \nsample, that misdemeanants were routinely strip searched without reasonable suspicion. Ward Aff. ¶¶ 18,19 \nand Exhibit A of Ward Affidavit.  \n  \n  28\n\nevidence that any official at Knox County made a clear or plain statement that this \npractice was to stop.  Defendants assert that new procedures, created after the 2000 Jail \nInspection Report was released, were intended to address the noted area of non-\ncompliance regarding misdemeanor detainees.18  Those new procedures, however, are \ndirected at misdemeanor detainees who had not been strip searched.  The foundational \ninformation that apparently spawned the new procedures – no misdemeanor detainees \nshall be strip searched without reasonable suspicion – was omitted from the procedures.  \nFor example, the procedure for implementing Policy C-120 that became effective in May \n2001, provided that detainees charged with misdemeanors “will be pat searched.” \nDefendants’ Ex. 49 (emphasis in original).19  The only mention of strip search is in a \nsection dealing with metal detector alerts where the procedure states “[a]rticulable \nsuspicion is justification for strip search.”  Defendants’ Ex. 49.  That overall procedure, \nhowever, does not make it clear to the corrections officers who had been strip searching \nall detainees, that the prior practice of strip searching misdemeanor detainees without \nreasonable suspicion must be stopped.20   \n                                                 \n18 Sheriff Davey’s February 2001 response to the Department of Corrections with respect to the finding of \nnon-compliance with Standard D.22.d on strip searches states that “strip searches of Class D and E will \nNOT take place except in those instances described in the standard.”  Defendants’ Ex. 62.  Defendants \nmake the point that they have never admitted or denied the findings in the Jail Inspection Reports that all \nmisdemeanor detainees were being strip searched.  \n    \n19 The 2000 Jail Inspection Report finding that all detainees were still being strip searched was issued in \nOctober of 2000.  The Court notes that the new procedure apparently aimed at addressing this issue did not \nbecome effective until six months after issuance of the Jail Inspection Report finding non-compliance with \nDepartment of Corrections Standards. \n \n20 While that is the most significant information missing, it is not the only information that was omitted in \nthe new procedure for implementing Policy C-120.  Sheriff Davey states that “although not specifically \nstated in the procedure for implementing Policy C-120, misdemeanor detainees who were not strip searched \nwere given yellow-colored jail uniforms to specifically distinguish them as non-searched inmates.”  Davey \nAff. ¶ 21A.   \n  29\n\nLikewise, the Court finds that the “Daily Activity Schedule for Designated \nHousing for Pre-Arraignment Detainees Class D and E Section 128/cells 130, 131, and \n132” and the “Management of Non-Search Inmates” provided direction to corrections \nofficers regarding the treatment of detainees who had not been strip searched.  The \n“Daily Activity Schedule for Designated Housing for Pre-Arraignment Detainees Class D \nand E Section 128/cells 130, 131, and 132,” like the procedure for implementing Policy \nC-120, specifically identifies cell assignments to be used for unsearched misdemeanor \ndetainees.  It states “Procedure for daily activities for all pre-arraignment detainees held \nin section 128, cells 130, 131 an 132.  All detainees held in this section HAVE NOT been \nstrip-searched; they will NOT have contact with each other for security reasons.”  \nDefendants’ Ex. 50.  From this statement it can be understood that if a detainee is housed \nin section 128 the detainee has not been searched.  But it does not provide that, except if \nan officer has reasonable suspicion that the detainee is in possession of contraband and \nconducts a strip search of that detainee, all misdemeanor detainees shall be housed in \nsection 128.  The memorandum on “Management of Non-Search Inmates,” issued one \nyear later, bears the same defect.  Defendants’ Ex. 51.  Neither memorandum provides a \nclear statement directing corrections officers not to strip search misdemeanor detainees \nwithout reasonable suspicion.  Defendants’ Exs. 50, 51.   \nWhile Defendants provided corrections officers copies of revisions to policies and \nall newly promulgated procedures, the most basic statement, which Defendants assert \nmotivated the creation of the new procedures for misdemeanor detainees, is curiously \nabsent from all the documents establishing new procedures.  As previously discussed, \nthose procedures are directed at misdemeanor detainees who have not been searched and \n  30\n\nnever clarify that, except if an officer has reasonable suspicion, no misdemeanor \ndetainees shall be strip searched.  Although there is evidence that after the new \nprocedural changes regarding misdemeanor detainees were implemented one corrections \nofficer may then have understood that they were not to strip search all misdemeanor \ndetainees, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20 (statement by Corrections Officer Kenney), this evidence \nalone is insufficient to refute the overwhelming evidence that the procedural changes \nwere not effectively tailored and that the practice continued on a widespread basis.  \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 20 (Corrections Officers Costigan and Daniello “both indicated that they \nrecalled a discussion several years ago in which the Voyer and D.O.C. policies were \nmentioned and that the decision was made by someone (unidentified) to disregard the \napplicable policy and standard and continue to search all inmates, regardless of crime \nclass, if they were to be admitted to the general population.”).21  The record is not \npersuasive that the procedural memoranda, issued after the 2000 Jail Inspection and \nsettlement of the Miller lawsuit, were directed at stopping the unconstitutional practice.  \nEven though it failed to promulgate new written procedures to eliminate the \nunconstitutional practice, Knox County could have employed a training regime directed \nat correcting the unconstitutional practice.  The record indicates that a “Entry Level \nTraining” procedure, which was in place since 1995, requires that all new full-time \ncorrections officers receive a copy of the Knox County Jail Policy and Procedure Manual \nand that a reference copy of the same be maintained in the booking area for all part-time \nemployees.  Defendants’ Ex. 47 (Policy A-131).  Pursuant to that policy pre-assignment \n                                                 \n \n21 Although in 2003, Corrections Officers Costigan and Daniello had been employed for a few years, the \nevidence in the record does not show when their employment with the Knox County Jail began.  \n  \n  31\n\ntraining shall be conducted for all new corrections officers.22  There is no separate \ncategory of training in Policy A-131 that specifically addresses strip searches.  Sheriff \nDavey asserts, however, that the training conducted in the areas of “Knox County Jail \nPolicies and Procedures, control of contraband, principles of body searches, and \nconstitutional law” all “deal with, and provide training in, the area of strip searches.”  \nDavey Aff. ¶ 6.  There is evidence that around 1998 at least two corrections officers’ \nentry level training included, contrary to Knox County written policy, the direction to \nstrip search all misdemeanor detainees admitted to the jail.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20 \n(Corrections Officer Kenney and Corrections Officer Winslow).  However, even if new \nofficers’ initial training on strip searches was conducted in accord with the written policy, \nsuch training was not aimed at stopping the corrections officers who were engaged in \ninstitutionally entrenched unconstitutional practice of strip searching all misdemeanor \ndetainees brought to the Knox County Jail.  The result was an ongoing practice that was \nfar removed from the written policy.    \nOther than the entry level training, there is meager evidence in the record that \nKnox County employed training to bring an end to this practice.  A training session was \nconducted on May 1, 2, and 3, 2001, by Lieutenant Cathy Wyman the subject of which \nwas “Procedures for Pre-Arraignment Class D and E Detainees.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 22.  The \n“Training Roster” provides the names of the corrections officers who attended the \ntraining sessions and their quiz scores, but does not indicate what subjects were covered \nor how long the training session lasted.  The record also includes a memorandum from \nLt. Wyman to the staff of the Knox County Jail dated the day after the final training \n                                                 \n22 The entry level training policy also requires that the jail administrator schedule training for all new full-\ntime corrections officers at the Maine Criminal Justice Academy within the first year of the individual’s \nemployment.  Defendants’ Ex. 47.   \n  32\n\nsession was completed, the subject of which is “Helpful hints on D and E detainee \nprocedures” and detailing “some of the issues that were brought forth during the training \nof the procedures.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 22.  Although the “hints” never explicitly state that \nmisdemeanor detainees shall not be strip searched, the memorandum states that “[r]equest \nby other law enforcement agencies for us to do a strip search because they feel they have \nprobable cause is a simple NO.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 22.  Lt. Wyman’s training sessions were \nconducted just days before Jail Administrator Robbins new “Procedure for Policy C-120 \nPre-Arraignment D & E Detainees” became effective and there is no evidence to suggest \nthat it included any more information than the new written procedure.  Defendants’ Ex. \n49 (effective May 4, 2001).  The memorandum by Lt. Wyman, like the new procedure for \nPolicy C-120 Pre-Arraignment D & E Detainees, fails to clarify for the corrections staff \nthat no misdemeanor detainee shall be strip searched without reasonable suspicion.   \nThere is also evidence in the record that a two-hour training session was \nconducted for corrections officers at the Knox County Jail in February and March of \n2002 on “Liability Issues in Corrections.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 21.  In addition to the names of \nthe corrections officers who attended the training, the record contains a document which \nappears to be authored by the attorney who conducted the training.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 21.  It \nis not known whether all the topics addressed in the document were actually discussed at \nthe training sessions or if the document was distributed to corrections officers during the \ntraining sessions.  For purposes of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, \nhowever, the Court will assume all topics in the document were discussed.   One of those \ntopics is “strip searches” and, the strongest guidance the document provides is \n“[a]lthough the use of the balancing test creates some uncertainty as to defining what the \n  33\n\nlaw is, it does appear that the general trend is that courts are identifying that it is \nunreasonable to conduct a strip search of a person arrested for traffic offenses or other \nminor offenses unless authorities have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is \nconcealing weapons or contraband on their person.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 21.  This qualified \nstatement leaves room to conclude that the practice of strip searching misdemeanor \ndetainees may be lawful.  It cannot, therefore, be understood as guidance directed at \nputting an end to a long-standing unconstitutional practice by Knox County. \nThe record before the Court contains no evidence that any official from Knox \nCounty directed, by way of written policy or procedure, training, or other means, that the \nunconstitutional practice stop.  It could be argued that the direction to stop strip searching \nall misdemeanor detainees was implicit in the new procedures and training.  Given the \nstrong evidence of the persistence of the unconstitutional practice even after the 2001 \nprocedural changes, no reasonable person could conclude that the actions of Knox \nCounty were directed at stopping the practice.  At some point, it must have been evident \nto Knox County officials that the corrections staff had not gotten the message.  Yet, there \nis no evidence that, even after the 2000 Jail Inspection Report indicated that the practice \nof strip searching all misdemeanor detainees who were housed continued, Sheriff Davey \nor any other official from Knox County promulgated any procedures, conducted any \ntraining, or engaged in any closer oversight, directed at eliminating the unconstitutional \nmisdemeanor search practices of the corrections officers at the Knox County Jail.   \nc. Cause of the Constitutional Deprivations \nPlaintiffs have established that the practice of strip searching misdemeanor \ndetainees without reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband was the \n  34\n\nmoving force behind constitutional deprivation of class members.  This practice was \nwidespread and not the result of the actions of a few uninformed corrections officers.  \nDefendants have failed to put forth any evidence to the contrary that may have created a \ngenuine issue of material fact.  Plaintiffs’ have established that corrections officers were \nfollowing the unconstitutional practice of strip searching misdemeanor detainees when \ntheir rights were violated.  An affirmative link between Knox County’s failure to take \naction to stop the unconstitutional practice of its corrections officers’and the violation of \nthe constitutional rights of Plaintiffs arrested on misdemeanor charges has been \nestablished.  The Court will, therefore, grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment against Knox County on that part of Count I as to liability alleging that \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights were violated as a result of the custom and practice of \nstrip searching all misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion. \n3. Failure to Train Corrections’ Officers \nAnother category of section 1983 cases which results in municipal liability arises \nin the so-called “failure to train” context.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges that \nKnox County is liable for its officers' unlawful actions because it had failed to properly \ntrain and supervise them.  The indefinite nature of judgments about the proper level of \ntraining for municipal employees has led the Supreme Court to express concern that \nfailure-to-train actions “would open municipalities to unprecedented liability under § \n1983,” Harris, 489 U.S. at 391, and has limited failure-to-train liability to the most \negregious cases.  Accordingly, “inadequacy of [correction officer] training may serve as \nthe basis for § 1983 liability only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate \nindifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.”  Id. at 388.  \n  35\n\nAlthough some facts are presented in the summary judgment record regarding the \ntraining given to Knox County corrections officers, Plaintiffs present no specific \nargumentation on their failure to train claim.  Accordingly, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment against Knox County on that part of Count I \nalleging a failure to train corrections officers.   \nB. INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY \n  The Court will start by determining whether Ms. Tardiff’s federal constitutional \nright to be free from unreasonable searches has been violated.  The Court will next \ndetermine Sheriff Davey’s responsibility for the Knox County Jail policy of strip \nsearching all non-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felony detainees without reasonable \nsuspicion.  Finally, the Court will address Sheriff Davey’s liability for the Knox County \nJail’s custom and practice of strip searching all misdemeanor detainees without \nreasonable suspicion.  \n1. Liability of Corrections Officers \na. Laurie Tardiff \nIt is undisputed in the record that on February 7, 2001, Ms. Tardiff was strip \nsearched at the Knox County Jail after being arrested on a warrant.  Defendants contend \nthat Ms. Tardiff was arrested on a violent felony charge and, therefore, her strip search \nwas reasonable.  Plaintiffs respond that despite being charged with a Class C crime, the \ncharge was of a non-violent nature.  While the parties agree that she was charged with \ntampering with a witness – a Class C felony, the summary judgment record presents \nissues of material fact as to the specific fact-based nature of the charge under which Ms. \nTardiff was arrested.  \n  36\n\nMaine criminal code section 454 – tampering with a witness – has both a non-\nthreatening and a threatening provision.  See 17-A § 454(1)(A) and 17-A § 454(1)(B).  \nWhile Defendants suggest that the Court should consider statements in the affidavits from \nthe victim that support the police officer’s affidavit to obtain an arrest warrant and \nconclude that the charge was of a threatening nature pursuant to 17-A § 454(1)(B)(1), \nDefendants’ Exs. 64, 65, Plaintiffs contend that the Court should simply rely on the \naffidavit submitted by the police officer in the application for the arrest warrant charging \n17-A § 454(1)(A)(2) – non-threatening witness tampering.  Defendants’ Exs. 63; \nMiddaugh Aff. ¶¶ 2, 3.  Although the police officer’s affidavit submitted to obtain the \narrest warrant for Ms. Tardiff clearly charges the non-threatening type of the offense, the \nactual arrest warrant for Ms. Tardiff is not provided in the record.  For that reason, the \nCourt is unable to determine the exact nature of the charge for which Ms. Tardiff was \narrested.   \nWhile the Court has already determined that it is unconstitutional to, as part of the \nbooking process, strip search a felony detainee not charged with a crime involving \nviolence, weapons or drugs without reasonable suspicion, there are issues of material fact \nregarding the charge upon which Ms. Tardiff was arrested that prevent the Court from \ndetermining if she qualifies as a member of the certified class.  Therefore, the Court will \ndeny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with respect to Ms. Tardiff on the \nclaims against the individual corrections officers raised in Counts IV and VI of the \nAmended Complaint.23  \n \n                                                 \n \n23 The Court notes that Defendants do not raise the qualified immunity defense with respect to the claims \nbrought against the individual corrections officers. \n  37\n\nb. Evidence of Other Individual Plaintiffs \nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs also present facts with respect to four individuals \nwho they allege were strip searched after being brought to the Knox County Jail on \nmisdemeanor charges.  Relying on the absence of a log entry noting a strip search, \nDefendants deny that those individuals were indeed strip searched.  Although additional \nsupport for the existence of an unconstitutional practice can certainly be inferred from \nspecific instances of such conduct, the summary judgment record with respect to three of \nthese individuals – Susan Winchenbach, Andrew Pratt, and Lynette Dean – presents \ngenuine issues of material fact that prevent the Court from considering whether their \nconstitutional rights were violated.24  Because the Intake/Release Log does not confirm \n                                                 \n \n24 Susan Winchenbach was stopped by a Knox County Deputy on March 13, 2000, for having a light out on \nher car and taken to the Knox County Jail on the charge of Operating After Suspension at approximately \n11:28 p.m.   Plaintiffs’ Ex. 5, Affidavit of Susan Winchenbach ¶ 3.  The parties dispute whether she was \nstrip searched at this time.  Winchenbach Aff. ¶ 4; Defendants’ Exs. 3-4.  A short time later, she returned to \nher vehicle by way of taxi cab.  Winchenbach Aff. ¶ 5.  With apparently no other way to get home, she got \nin her car and began to drive.  She was immediately pulled over, arrested, and returned to the jail.  \nWinchenbach Aff. ¶ 5.  The parties dispute whether she was strip searched at this time.  Winchenbach \nAffidavit ¶ 6 and Defendants’ Exs. 5-11.  During her sixty-hour stay at the Knox County Jail, she was seen \nby the jail physician in the company of a Correction Officer.  Winchenbach Affidavit ¶ 6.  After seeing the \nphysician, she asserts that she was strip searched for a third time.  Winchenbach Affidavit ¶ 6. The parties \ndispute whether she was strip searched at this time.     \n  Ms. Winchenbach remained at the jail until she was taken to court at 2:05 p.m. on March 16, 2000, \nwhen she was brought before a judge and sentenced to time served.  See Defendants’ Ex. 11.  She was \nreturned from court at 3:08 p.m. as a sentenced inmate and strip searched at 3:23 p.m.  Defendants’ Ex. 11.   \nAfter being placed in a holding cell, she was released from jail at 3:44 p.m.  Defendants’ Ex. 11.  Being a \nsentenced inmate, this search is outside the class definition.  However, there are issues of fact as to whether \nMs. Winchenbach was strip searched on any of the three other occasions as she alleges.  \n  Andrew Pratt was arrested on December 12, 2002, on a violation of a protection from abuse order \na Class D crime.  The parties dispute whether he was strip searched.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 7, Affidavit of Andrew \nPratt ¶ 6; Defendants’ Ex. 32.   \n  With respect to Lynette Dean, there are issues of material fact regarding the justification for her \nstrip search.  Lynette Dean was arrested for operating under the influence on November 10, 2000.   \nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 3, Affidavit of Lynette Dean ¶ 3.  She was taken to the Knox County Jail, bailed, and \nreleased.  Dean Aff. ¶ 3.  Intake records indicate that at approximately 11:00 p.m. on December 21, 2000, \nshe was arrested for violating her conditions of release, a class E crime, see 15 M.R.S.A. § 1092, and she \nwas taken again to the Knox County Jail where she was held in a holding cell.  Dean Aff. ¶ 4; Defendants’ \nEx. 13.  Dean was strip searched at 7:02 a.m. on December 22, 2000.  Dean Affidavit ¶ 5; Defendants’ Ex. \n14.  Defendants contend that she was strip searched because she exhibited hostile and assaultive behavior.  \nDefendants’ Exs. 13, 14.  Although the Intake/Release Log indicates that Ms. Dean was taken to a “detox” \n  38\n\nthat those individuals were strip searched, the Court may be required at some later date to \nundertake a more in depth inquiry into the reliability of Defendants’ record keeping.25  \nThe other proposed individual Plaintiff – Judy Carter – was a sentenced inmate at the \ntime she was strip searched and as such she does not fall within the previously certified \nclass.26  Therefore, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nwith respect to Ms. Winchenbach, Mr. Pratt, Ms. Dean, and Ms. Carter on their claims \nagainst the individual corrections officers raised in Counts IV and VI of the Amended \nComplaint. \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \ncell “due to abusive language, hostile and assaultive behavior” it does not indicate why approximately 8 \nhours later she was strip searched.  Defendants’ Exs. 13, 14.     \n \n25 The Court understands Plaintiffs to assert that these deficiencies in Defendants’ record keeping support a \nseparate section 1983 violation.  As Defendants point out, the violation of an internal policy or procedure or \neven rules promulgated by the Attorney General, does not per se amount to a constitutional violation.  See \nBeltran v. City of El Paso, 367 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir. 2004); Medina v. Cram, 252 F.3d 1124, 1133 (10th \nCir. 2001); Collins v. Bellinghausen, 153 F.3d 591, 596 (8th Cir. 1998); White v. Olig, 56 F.3d 817, 820 \n(7th Cir. 1995); Patterson v. Coughlin, 761 F.2d 886, 891 (2d Cir. 1985).  However, the ultimate reliability \nof Defendants’ record keeping may be significant in resolving other issues in this case. \nThe Attorney General's Rules, the Department of Corrections Standards, and Defendants own \npolicies require the articulation of reasonable suspicion in the record to justify any strip search.  \nDefendants’ Exs. 48, 57 and 58.  Defendants’ record keeping on strip searches performed at the Knox \nCounty Jail appears to be deficient.  In both the 1994 and 2000 Jail Inspection Reports, State Inspector \nHinckley noted that the Jail was not keeping the required strip search log and was not articulating in their \nrecord any reasonable suspicion they had to justify a strip search of a detainee.  Hinckley Depo. at 140-41.  \nIndeed, except where the charge itself may provide reasonable suspicion upon which to conduct a search, \nthe Intake/Release Log does not contain the reason that any detainee was strip searched.  Robbins Depo. at \n135; Hinckley Depo. at 142; Affidavit of Michelle Ward ¶ 20 and Exhibits A through D of Ward Aff.  \nThere is insufficient evidence in this record for the Court to make a wholesale determination regarding the \naccuracy of Defendants’ record keeping regarding when strip searches were conducted.  Specifically, the \nCourt cannot conclude from the noted deficiencies in the record keeping and the log book entries proffered \non summary judgment that every misdemeanor detainee was strip searched. \n \n26 Judy Carter was arrested for OUI on November 19, 1998.  Affidavit of Judy Carter, Exhibit 5, ¶ 3.  At the \ntime she was arrested she was not strip searched.  However, after she was sentenced to 24 hours in jail but \nbefore she began to serve her sentence on December 9, 1999, she was strip searched at the Knox County \nJail.  Carter Affidavit ¶ 5.  Thereafter, she was placed in a holding cell.  Carter Affidavit ¶ 5.  As she was \nsentenced inmate, Judy Carter’s strip search does not fall within the class definition.  See Order Granting \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification (Docket Item No. 21) at 5.   \n  39\n\n2. Supervisory Liability of Sheriff Davey \nPlaintiffs have also sued Sheriff Davey in both his official and his personal \ncapacity.  Official capacity suits “’generally represent only another way of pleading an \naction against an entity of which an officer is an agent.’”  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. \n159, 165, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 3105, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at \n690 n. 55).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ suit against Sheriff Davey in his official capacity \nshall be treated as an action against Knox County.  Discussed supra.  Personal capacity \nsuits, however, seek to impose personal liability upon a government official and damages \nare recoverable from the official’s personal assets.  Graham, 105 S.Ct. at 3105.  \n The undisputed facts establish that Sheriff Davey has final decision making \nauthority with respect to all policy and operational matters at the Knox County Jail.  \nDavey Aff. ¶ 2.  Since Sheriff Davey was elected Sheriff of Knox County in 1985 and \nhas remained in that position for the entire class period, he may be responsible for \nunconstitutional strip search policies and practices during the class period.  Davey Aff. ¶ \n1.   When a plaintiff asserts claims against an individual in his supervisory capacity, \nliability cannot be established on a basis of respondeat superior.  Rather, “[a] supervisor \nmay be found liable only on the basis of his own acts or omissions.  Moreover, a \nsupervisor cannot be liable for merely negligent acts.  A supervisor's acts or omissions \nmust amount to a reckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of others.”  \nFebus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, 14 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal citations \nomitted). \n \n \n  40\n\na. Detainees Charged with Non-Violent, Non-Weapon, and Non-Drug Felony \nPlaintiffs have shown that Sheriff Davey’s written policy permitted, as part of the \nbooking process, the strip searching all detainees charged with non-violent, non-weapon, \nnon-drug felonies without reasonable suspicion of concealing contraband or weapons \ncaused the deprivation of their rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Defendant Davey \nhas raised the defense of qualified immunity.  Whether an official may prevail in a \nqualified immunity defense depends upon the “objective reasonableness of [his] conduct \nas measured by reference to clearly established law.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. \n800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982).  A government official making a \npolicy decision is entitled to qualified immunity if the law was not clearly established at \nthe time the determination was made.  If the law is unclear, “an official could not \nreasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly \nbe said to ‘know’ that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.”  Id. \nThe Court does not think it a great leap from prior cases for a reasonable law \nenforcement officer to conclude that invasive strip searches of all detainees who arrive at \na local correctional facility, like Knox County Jail, who are charged with non-violent, \nnon-weapon or non-drug felonies, must be supported by reasonable particularized \nsuspicion.  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence concerning the standard for determining the \nreasonableness of a strip search has been rather consistent for many years.  See, e.g., Bell, \n441 U.S. at 559; Swain, 117 F.3d at 7; Justice v. City of Peachtree, 961 F.2d 188, 192 \n(11th Cir. 1992); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); Weber v. Dell, \n804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th \nCir.1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir.1984); Mary Beth G. v. City of \n  41\n\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983).  Although it has been clearly established \nin the law for some time that a blanket policy of strip searching all misdemeanor \ndetainees is unlawful, the constitutionality of a policy of strip searching detainees \ncharged with non-violent, non-weapon, and non-drug felonies without reasonable \nsuspicion has not been previously established in this Circuit.   The fact that neither the \nSupreme Court nor the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has \nspecifically ruled on the constitutionality of blanket strip search policies for detainees \ncharged with non-violent, non-weapon or non-drug felonies, inclines the Court to find \nthat Sheriff Davey is entitled to the benefit of the doubt on this point.  Although conduct \ncould potentially violate clearly established law even if the allegedly unconstitutional \nconduct had not been the subject of a prior court case, see Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, \n739, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666 (2002), the right allegedly violated must be \ndefined at an appropriate level of specificity before a court can conclude that it was \nclearly established, see Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 143 L. Ed. \n2d 818 (1999)(citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 \nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).   \nThe Department of Corrections Standards and the Attorney General’s Rules \npermit strip searches of all felony detainees.  Sheriff Davey’s reliance on those standards \nand rules, led to the development and implementation of Knox County’s policy \nauthorizing strip searches of all felony detainees.  While the Fourth Amendment rights of \nthose individuals charged with felonies of a non-violent, non-weapon, and non-drug \nnature who were automatically strip searched were indeed violated, the Court concludes \nthat those rights were not clearly established in the law during the relevant class period.  \n  42\n\nThe Court concludes that Sheriff Davey is, therefore, entitled to qualified immunity for \nthe Knox County Jail Policy permitting the strip search of all persons charged with non-\nviolent, non-weapon, and non-drug felonies without reasonable suspicion.   \nBecause he prevails on his defense of qualified immunity, the Court will deny \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with respect that part of Count II \nalleging that Sheriff Davey is responsible, in his personal capacity, for the Knox County \nJail’s unlawful policy of strip searching detainees charged with non-violent, non-weapon, \nand non-drug felonies.  The Court will, therefore, grant Summary Judgment to Sheriff \nDavey establishing that he is entitled to qualified immunity for Plaintiffs’ claim in Count \nII of an unconstitutional policy with respect to strip searching detainees charged with \nnon-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felonies without reasonable suspicion.   \nb. Detainees Charged with Misdemeanors \nAlthough the written policies conformed to constitutional standards applicable to \nmisdemeanants, Plaintiffs have shown that the Knox County Jail, under the leadership of \nSheriff Davey, had a widespread custom and practice of strip searching all detainees \ncharged with misdemeanors without reasonable suspicion that they were concealing \ncontraband and that this practice caused the deprivation of their rights under the Fourth \nAmendment.  “If the right the government allegedly violated was clearly established at \nthe time of the challenged conduct, ‘the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, since a \nreasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.’”  \nLynch v. City of Boston, 180 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1999)(quoting Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818-\n19).   During the relevant class period, the Knox County Jail’s practice of strip searching \nall new detainees charged with misdemeanors without reasonable suspicion, was clearly \n  43\n\nunconstitutional.  See Swain, 117 F.3d at 5 (“[I]t was clearly established at the time of the \nsearch [in 1993] that the Fourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to \nconduct a [strip search].”)(emphasis in original).  Maintenance of the practice after the \noperative class date – November 19, 1996 – insofar as it applied to misdemeanants, \ncannot be shielded by qualified immunity.   \nUnlike individual officer liability, the liability of supervisory officials does not \ndepend on their personal participation in the acts of their subordinates which immediately \nbrought about the violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  See Voutour v. Vitale, \n761 F.2d 812, 819 (1st Cir. 1985).  Liability can result from Sheriff Davey’s \nacquiescence to Knox County Jail’s ongoing practice of strip searching all detainees \ncharged with misdemeanors.  See Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U.S. 701, \n737, 109 S. Ct. 2702, 105 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1989) (A municipal policymaker may be found \nto have caused subordinate officials’ conduct by reason of the policymaker’s \n“acquiescence in a long standing practice or custom which constitutes the ‘standard \noperating procedure’ of the local governmental entity.”).   \nSome evidence in the record points to Sheriff Davey’s actual knowledge of this \nongoing practice.  For example, the 1994 and 2000 Jail Inspection Reports and the \nstatements made by two corrections officers that they “recalled a discussion several years \nago in which the Voyer and D.O.C. policies were mentioned and that the decision was \nmade by someone (unidentified) to disregard the applicable policy and standard and \ncontinue to search all inmates, regardless of crime class, if they were admitted to the \ngeneral population.”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20.  However, Sheriff Davey disputes that he had \nactual knowledge of the unlawful custom and practice of strip searching detainees \n  44\n\ncharged with misdemeanors without reasonable suspicion of concealing contraband or \nweapons.  Davey Aff. ¶ 14.  Regardless of his actual knowledge, the Court concludes that \nbased on the undisputed evidence in the record he should have known that the practice \nwas ongoing, and that, despite the change to the written policy in 1994 and the institution \nof new procedures in 2001, the practice had not been eliminated.  The issue then becomes \nwhether Plaintiffs have established that Sheriff Davey’s conduct amounts to deliberate \nindifference or willful blindness to an unconstitutional practice of his subordinates.  See \nCamilo-Robles, 151 F.3d at 7.  Finally, Plaintiffs must establish a causal connection \nbetween Sheriff Davey’s conduct and the corrections officers’ unconstitutional actions.  \nSee Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir. 1994).  \nBoth Jail Inspection Reports noted that, based on staff statements made at the \ntime, the practice by corrections officers of strip searching all detainees charged with \nmisdemeanors was ongoing and that it needed to stop.  It is telling that even after the \n2000 Jail Inspection Report clearly found that misdemeanor detainees were being \nroutinely strip searched, there was no clear and plain statement by Sheriff Davey that this \npractice was to stop.  Sheriff Davey put in place new procedures for misdemeanor \ndetainees after the 2000 Jail Inspection, yet, as discussed in the section on municipal \nliability, none of those new procedures clearly stated that misdemeanor detainees were \nnot to be strip searched absent reasonable suspicion.  Defendants’ Exs. 49, 50.   As \ndiscussed in detail in the prior section on municipal liability, although it appears that \nSheriff Davey directed the jail administrator to clarify the procedures for detainees who \nhad not been strip searched, he never plainly directed that the corrections officers not \n  45\n\nsearch misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, he failed to \nprovide remedial training aimed at correcting the unlawful practice.      \n  Sheriff Davey’s assent to this ongoing unconstitutional practice is evident by \nreviewing his corrections department’s daily log entries.  Examination of the \nIntake/Release Log, maintained in the booking area of the jail, indicates that corrections \nofficers were strip searching misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion.  For \nexample, as recently as July 13, 2001, Corrections Officer Springer strip searched a \ndetainee charged with driving to endanger – a Class E crime, Defendants’ Ex. 67; Ex. A \nto Ward Aff., and on July 6, 2001, Corrections Officer Waterman strip searched a \ndetainee charged with OUI – a Class D crime, Defendants’ Ex. 68; Ex. B to Ward \nAffidavit.  Indeed, the record indicates that Sheriff Davey was a named defendant in the \nMiller lawsuit, which alleged that after being arrested and brought to the Knox County \nJail on a misdemeanor charge plaintiff was strip searched.   \nFurther confirmation of Sheriff Davey’s acquiescence to the practice is \nhighlighted in intradepartmental memoranda.  In 2001, Jail Administrator Robbins wrote \nto local police chiefs notifying them that the Knox County Jail would no longer provide \nthe service of strip searching misdemeanor arrestees on “the request of arresting officers \n(for the purpose of discovering evidence).”  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 23.  Obviously, before the \nlocal police departments received these memoranda, corrections officers conducted strip \nsearches of misdemeanor arrestees on the request of the arresting police officer.  In \naddition, statements by corrections officers in 2003, during an interview with Jail \nAdministrator Robbins, support the conclusion that corrections officers believed that they \nshould ignore the policy directing that misdemeanor detainees shall not be strip searched \n  46\n\nwithout reasonable suspicion and continue to strip search all detainees admitted to the \njail.  Plaintiffs’ Ex. 20.  The widespread practice was sufficient to alert Sheriff Davey that \nthe unlawful strip search practice persisted.  On the evidence presented in the summary \njudgment record, the Court concludes that Sheriff Davey’s failure to take any corrective \naction directed at eradicating this pervasive practice – even in the face of official \nDepartment of Corrections’ reports and the incontrovertible record evidence that the \npractice persisted – amounts to a reckless indifference of the constitutional rights of class \nmembers arrested on misdemeanor charges.  Sheriff Davey’s reckless indifference \nallowed the practice to persist for years and caused the violation of the constitutional \nrights of Plaintiffs arrested on misdemeanor charges.   \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment with respect to that part of Count II alleging that Sheriff Davey is \nresponsible, in his personal capacity, for the Knox County Jail’s unconstitutional custom \nand practice of strip searching detainees charged with misdemeanors.    \nIII. CONCLUSION \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary \n Judgment, be and it is hereby, GRANTED in respect to: \nCount I against Knox County on Plaintiffs’ claim of an unconstitutional policy \nwith respect to strip searching all felony detainees and an unconstitutional custom \nor practice of strip searching all misdemeanor detainees; and   \nCount II against Sheriff Davey on Plaintiffs’ claim of an unconstitutional custom \nor practice of strip searching all misdemeanor detainees. \nIt is further ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, be and it  \nis hereby, DENIED in respect to: \n  47\n\nCount I against Knox County on Plaintiffs’ claim of failure to train corrections \nofficers; \nCount II against Sheriff Davey on Plaintiffs’ claim of an unconstitutional policy \nwith respect to strip searching all felony detainees; and  \nCount IV and VI against individual corrections officers for the strip searches of \nLaurie Tardiff, Susan Winchenbach, Andrew Pratt, Lynette Dean, and Judy \nCarter. \nFinally, it is ORDERED that summary judgment be, and it is hereby, GRANTED to \nSheriff Davey establishing that he is entitled to qualified immunity for Plaintiffs’ claim in \nCount II of an unconstitutional policy with respect to strip searching detainees charged \nwith non-violent, non-weapon, non-drug felonies without reasonable suspicion.   \n           /s/ Gene Carter   \n            Gene Carter \n            Senior United States District Judge                                 \nDated this 2nd day of November, 2005. \n  48",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDistrict of Maine\n) Docket No.  02-251-PC\nDALE DARE, )\nPlaintiff )\n)\nv. )\n)\nKNOX COUNTY, DANIEL DAVEY, )\nJANE DOE and JOHN DOE, )\nDefendants )\n)\nDEFENDANTS’ RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR\nFINAL SETTLEMENT APPROVAL\nNOW COME Defendants, through counsel, and hereby respond to Pl aintiffs’ Motion for\nFinal Settlement Approval.\nThe Defendants join with Plaintiffs in seeking approval of the settlement on the terms set\nforth in the agreement reached between the parties on September 29, 2006.  The Defendants submit\nthis filing for two principal reasons: (1) to alert the Court to the f act that the Defendants have\nbrought claims against Laurie Tardiff seeking to enforce the settlement as to her and to therefore\nrequest that the Court take account of the po ssibility of such enforcem ent and reserve funds\nsufficient to pay Tardiff one share of the settlement fund, plus an appropriate bonus, and (2) to\naddress certain statements made by Plaintiff in the Motion for Final Settlement Approval.\nA.  THE DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST LAURIE TARDIFF ARISING OUT\nOF HER ATTEMPT TO OPT OUT OF THIS SETTLEMENT.\nThe Court is well aware of the Defendants’ contention that Laurie Tardiff is bound to the\nsettlement agreement and does not have the right to opt out of the agreement.  The Defendants have\nrepeatedly reserved their right to en force the settlement as to Tardiff.  Transcript of 10/11/06\nHearing, pp. 47-49; Transcript of 10/24/06 Hearing, pp. 5-6; Transcript of 11/27/06 Hearing, pp.\n\n6-9, 11-12, 15-17; Transcript of 12/18/06 Hearing, p. 11.  The Court has acknowledged that the\nDefendants may challenge Tardiff’s attempt to opt out of the settlement.  Transcript of 11/27/06\nHearing, p. 8.\nMs. Tardiff has attempted to opt out by filing an Opt Out/Exclusion Form  with the Dare\nClaims Administrator.  Tardiff subsequently filed a civil action against Knox County and Jane Doe\n(Laurie Tardiff v. Knox County and Jane Doe, Docket No. 07-cv-10).  The Defendants have filed\na counterclaim against Ms. Tardiff alleging breach of contract and equitable estoppel.  (Tardiff v.\nKnox County, et al, Docket No. 07-cv-10, Docket Item No. 7).  In the event that the Defendants are\nsuccessful on either count of their counterclaim , Ms. Tardiff will be bound to the  settlement\nagreement in the instant action and will only be entitled to recover from the settlement fund. \nThe Defendants are amenable to the Court reserving a portion of the settlem ent fund to\ncompensate Ms. Tardiff for her share in the litigation, plus an appropriate bonus for her efforts as\nthe class representative.  In the event that Tardiff is ultimately found to be bound to the settlement,\nshe would be able to recover from the reserved portion of the fund.  In the event that she is not\nbound to the settlement, then the reserve proceeds could be distributed by thec y pres doctrine.1  Of\ncourse, the Defendants urge the Court to approve the settlement even if it declines to set aside funds\nspecifically for Ms. Tardiff. \n1Reservation of a small portion of the total settlement fund would only marginally reduce\nthe amount being paid to the other approved claimants.  Class counsel has repeatedly referred to\nthe total settlement as “extraordinary”, Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of Settlement, p. 4;\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 3-4, 12, and have observed that individual class\nmembers will receive a cash payment “in the neighborhood of $5,000\".   Motion for Approval of\nSettlement, p. 10.  Class counsel has also observed that this payment far exceeds the payments to\nindividual class members in the matter of Nilsen v. York County, Docket No. 02-212.  Plaintiff’s\nMotion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 13.\n2\n\nB.  CORRECTIONS TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR FINAL SETTLEMENT APPROVAL\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Final Settlement Approval contain a number of inaccuracies, including\nattributions of motive to the Defendants, which require correction, as they are now a matter of public\nrecord.  \n1. The Defendants dispute class counsel’s description of the course of litigation.\nPage 3 of class counsel’s memorandum contains a description of the course of litigation in\nthis case from April 1, 2006, to the settlement conference of September 29, 2006, which can best\nbe described as an exercise i n rhetorical excess.  Defendants do not agree with m any of the\ncharacterizations in that part of the memorandum but believe that this Court is sufficiently familiar\nwith this litigation to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n2. Discovery and Electronic Data\nPlaintiffs assert that “comprehensive interrogatories and document request(sic) were made\n. . .”.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Settlement Approval, p. 8.  In point of fact, neither side served\ninterrogatories on the other.\nPlaintiffs also assert that “extensi ve information was obtained electronically by on-site\ninspection of the jails(sic) electronic records, and that thousands of lines of electronic data were\nanalyzed by experts on both sides”.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Settlement Approval, pp. 8, 13.\nThese statements are factually inaccurate.  Alt hough Plaintiffs engaged experts in an attem pt to\nextract electronic information from the jail’s computers, the Defendants informed Plaintiffs’ counsel\n– before, during and af ter this exercise – that the jail did  not maintain inmate information\nelectronically and that any electronic inform ation which existed was entered after the fact as a\ntraining exercise on computer software that was never used as it had been intended when it was\n3\n\npurchased.  Indeed, after spending many tens of thousands of dollars, Plaintiffs reported to the Court\nexactly what the Defendants had been representnig all along: the information on the computers was\nof no use, and the only source of the information which Plaintiffs desired was contained in paper\nrecords.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Aid in Identification of Class Members, Sept. 15, 2004, Docket Item\nNo. 49.\n3. The paper records maintained by the Jail were of sufficient quality for the Plaintiffs\nto recommend that the Court allow the claims administrator to use those records for\npurposes of acting upon claims by class members.\nIn Plaintiffs’ motion, Plaintiffs refer to “the poor quality of the records”. P  laintiff’s Motion\nfor  Final Settlement Approval, p. 9.  The  records m aintained  by the jail were presented\nchronologically for an eight-year period (four months, believed to be contained in a single banker’s\nbox, were missing).  These records were organized shift- by-shift, day-by-day, week-by-week,\nmonth-by-month, and year-by-year.  The records identified all of the activity in the intake/release\narea of the jail, which is the area where the strip searches that are the subject of this action wer e\nalleged to have occurred.  The records documented the activity of each inmate and the correctional\nofficers, including when the inmates came into the jail, what crimes they were charged with, whether\nor not they were strip searched, and if so, by whom.  \nWhile perhaps not ideally suited as a source of data for a § 1983 class action lawsuit, the\nrecords allowed counsel to identify all possible class members.\nIndeed, in the settlement agreement, Plaintiffs recommend that the administrator review\nclaim forms submitted by class members and compare the claims with “available booking data\npreviously provided by the Defendants”, and use that data to act on the  individual claims.  Third\nFinal Settlement Agreement, § VII(1)  and (3), Docket Item No. 376.   The “booking data” is\n4\n\ninformation obtained exclusively from the records.  Plaintiffs’ recommendation that the claims\nadministrator use data from the Defendant’s records as the exclusive source of accepting or rejecting\na class member’s claim demonstrate that the records were sufficient.\n4. Defendants deny that it was their practice to strip search all inmates.\nIn their motion, Plaintiffs state that “Defendants have not denied that the challenged strip\nsearch practice occurred . . .”.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Final Settlement Approval, p. 11.  In fact, to\nthe contrary, the Defendants have always denied th at such a practice existed.  In addition to the\ndenials contained in the answers to Plaintiffs’ complaint and amended complaint, the Defendants\nvigorously opposed Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing, in part, that there was no\ncustom or practice sufficient to impose liability on Knox County.  To this day, the Defendants deny\nthat there was a custom or practice of strip searching all detainees at the Knox County Jail.  The jail\nrecords conclusively demonstrate that there was no such custom or practice.\n5. The  Court’s order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sum mary  Judgment  was and is\ninterlocutory in nature and does not cont ain findings that may be used by class\nmembers who have opted out in subsequent litigation.\nPlaintiffs argue that class members who have opted out of the settlement may use “the Partial\nSummary Judgment and the Injunctive Order to their advantage”.   Plaintiff’s Motion for Final\nSettlement Approval, p. 12.  The summary judgment order was andi s interlocutory in nature.  A final\njudgment never ensued.  The order cannot be used against the Defendants in subsequent litigation\nbrought by class members who have opted out.\nCONCLUSION\n5\n\nThe Defendants join Plaintiffs in requesting that the settlement be approved.  Defendants\nreiterate their position that Laurie Tardiff is bound to the settlement.  Defendants also correct the\nrecord with respect to inaccuracies contained in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Settlement Approval\nas set forth hereinbove.\nDated: April 20, 2007  /s/ Peter T.

Schneiter and Sarah Wunsch, American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts,\non brief for American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, Amicus Curiae.\nBefore BOUDIN, Chief Judge, CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, and LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\nBOUDIN, Chief Judge.\nBefore us are orders certifying class actions in two jailhouse strip search cases. The two cases, arising before\ntwo different judges in the same court (Judges Carter and Hornby), are targeted at two different Maine counties\n(Knox and York). In each case, a named plaintiff seeks to represent others who (it is alleged) were improperly\nstrip searched. Following certification of the classes, we allowed interlocutory appeals and now affirm.\nOver the last few decades, a changed popular sensibility has produced a series of decisions curtailing what was\n[1]\nonce an apparently routine practice in many jails of strip searching arrestees not yet convicted of any crime.\nSuch cases have included, or brought in their wake, lawsuits by those who were searched seeking damages from\nofficials or governmental entities responsible for the searches. E.g., Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12-13\n(1st Cir.2000). These suits are ordinarily framed as Fourth Amendment claims for unconstitutional search and\nseizure and brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000). Id.\nQualified immunity has defeated some of these claims against officials, e.g., Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d\n23, 33 (1st Cir.2003) (en banc), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1109, 124 S.Ct. 1074, 157 L.Ed.2d 895 (2004), but the\ndoctrine does not protect counties, see Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 650, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63\nL.Ed.2d 673 (1980). Though not liable under a respondeat superior theory, Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown,\n520 U.S. 397, 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), counties and like entities may be liable under\nsection 1983 not only for their formal official acts and policies, but also, under some circumstances, for practices\n\n\"so permanent and well settled\" as to constitute established custom. Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S.\n658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (quoting Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167-68, 90\nS.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)).\nIn the first case before us 00 brought against Knox County, its sheriff, and unidentified officers 00 Laurie Tardiff filed\n97 97\nsuch a section 1983 claim, asserting that she had been arrested for witness tampering after having been\npreviously charged with violating an anti-harassment order. Tardiff v. Knox County, 218 F.R.D. 332, 334\n3 (D.Me.2003). At the jail house, Tardiff *3 alleged that she was taken to a shower area, ordered by a female\ncorrections officer to disrobe, and required to \"squat and cough\" while the officer could see her vagina and anal\narea. Id.\nJudge Carter, presiding in the case, called this a \"strip and visual body cavity search,\" Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 334;\nJudge Hornby, faced with a similar description by the lead plaintiff in a parallel suit against York County, called the\nsame thing a \"strip search,\" Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 22, 25 (D.Me.2003). For simplicity's sake, we\nuse \"strip search\" in this decision to cover the described conduct, recognizing that the phrase is used variously in\ndifferent decisions and that there is a spectrum of possible search practices inflicting differing indignities. Just\nwhat happened to Tardiff and others may itself be disputed.\nTardiff sought to represent a class of persons similarly situated and in due course Judge Carter certified a class\nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336. The class, as defined by the court, covered:\nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or visual body\ncavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the\nKnox County Jail:\n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony;\nor\n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent\nfelony; or\n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs,\nor a violent felony; or\n(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent\nfelony.\nId.\nIn the second case, brought before Judge Hornby, a substitute lead plaintiff 00 Michael Goodrich 00 was arrested\n97 97\nfor failing to report for probation and (he alleges) was strip searched with the same strip, squat and cough\nprocedure as Tardiff. Nilsen219 F.R.D. at 22. Like Tardiff, he alleged that this was done in accordance with a\npolicy or custom of the county that was applied widely to arrestees including those charged with unthreatening\noffenses. Judge Hornby, acting shortly after Judge Carter, entered a comparable order certifying a class under\n[2]\nRule 23(b)(3). Id. at 19-20.\nIn each case, the defendants sought interlocutory review of the class certification. We have discretion as to\nwhether to entertain such an appeal. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(f) and 1998 advisory committee's note to subdivision\n(f). One reason for review is a threat of liability so large as to place on the defendant an \"irresistible pressure to\nsettle.\" Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir.2000). Although we thought it quite\npossible that the certification orders would survive review, the financial and similar information provided by the\ntwo counties in this case persuaded us to grant interlocutory review, which we expedited.\n4 *4 Nominally, review of decisions granting or denying class certification is for \"abuse of discretion,\" Smilow v.\nS.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir.2003), but this chameleon phrase is misleading. Express\nstandards for certification are contained in Rule 23, so an appeal can pose pure issues of law reviewed de novo\n\nor occasionally raw fact findings that are rarely disturbed. See id. Here, we are concerned with applying general\n[3]\nstandards to particular facts where the touchstone is \"reasonableness\" and review is deferential.\nAll class actions certified under Rule 23 must meet certain prerequisites listed in subsection (a): there must be\nnumerosity of class members, common questions of law or fact, the representative must be typical of the class,\nand his or her representation of the class must be adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Here, these preconditions are\nadmittedly satisfied. The defendants' attack is instead on the further requirement, for a(b)(3) class, that the court\nfind that common questions \"predominate\" over individual ones and that the class action be \"superior\" to other\nmethods of resolving the controversy. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).\nSubsection (b)(3), the cute tiger cub that has grown into something unexpectedly fearsome in civil rights and\nmass tort litigation, is a joinder device for consolidating separate but similar claims 00 as opposed, for example, to\n97\ndisputes about a common fund, which is covered by subsection (b)(1)(B). The subsection lists non-exclusive\nfactors for making the determination 00 the most pertinent here is manageability 00 but the \"predominance\" and\n97 97\n\"superiority\" labels turn largely on the particular facts and issues presented. Some courts have allowed strip\n[4]\nsearch class actions and others not.\nWhat here are the issues? The principal ones 00 and this is our own very rough cut 00 appear to be these: what\n97 97\nrule, policy or custom as to strip searches was in force in each county during the periods in question; was it lawful\nas applied to groups or individual class members; if unlawful as to some categories of arrestees, were there still\nfacts as to particular arrestees that justified a strip search; and if liability exists, what are the damages to each\nperson injured? There are obviously other issues (e.g., as to individual defendants); but these four are likely the\nmost important.\nOn the first issue 00 what rules, policies or customs prevailed 00 there is already deep disagreement between\n97 97\nplaintiffs and defendants. So the question arises whose version is a court to assume for purposes of deciding\nwhether a class action is even suitable? It is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint's allegations are\nnecessarily controlling; but class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test\n5 disputed premises early on if and when the class action *5 would be proper on one premise but not another.[5]\nIn this case, whether there was a rule, policy or custom of automatically strip searching all or most categories of\narrestees is on its face a common disputed issue 00 as both sides concede. Nothing here obliged the district\n97\ncourts to do more than view the issue as such and, so viewed, it weighs in favor of class action status. The issue\nis like any other common predicate to liability for multiple parallel claims 00 say whether the train engineer was\n97\nnegligent (or acting within the scope of his employment) when the train went off the rails. See, e.g., Am. Trading\n& Prod. Corp. v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 47 F.R.D. 155, 157 (N.D.Ill.1969).\nThe second issue, whether the strip search policy is unlawful, presents different complications. The first is that it\nmight be lawful as to some groups of arrestees (say, those arrested on firearm felony charges) and not others\n(say, those seized for non-payment of parking tickets). Both district courts sought to narrow the potential\nmultiplicity of categories 00 which could in several respects work against class status 00 by narrowing the class. In\n97 97\nboth orders, the class definition excluded those arrested for drugs, weapons or violent felonies 00 categories for\n97\nwhich automatic strip searches might seem easier to defend. Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 25; Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336.\nOf course, the defendants might still persuade the court that some within the remaining group of arrestees (e.g.,\nthose arrested for misdemeanors of certain types) could also be strip searched as a matter of course. But the\ncore notion that some classes of arrestees should not be strip searched without particularized suspicion is now\n[6]\nembedded in the case law.  Just what groups within the class can or cannot be searched without such\nsuspicion appears, like the rule-policy-custom question, to present a common set of issues proper for a class\naction.\nTurning to the third of the issues we listed, defendants say that individualized suspicion may have existed as to \nanyone within the certified class, so that every class member necessarily presents a different problem even as to\nliability. True, a class member arrested for the most minor and non-violent of offenses might arguably warrant a\n\nstrip search by his individual behavior (violently resisting arrest) or prior record (armed assaults). If such an\nindividual evaluation were necessary in every case, this might doom an efficient class action.\nBoth district courts sought to finesse the issue by defining the class to include only those who were searched\n6 without evaluation for individualized suspicion. Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 25 (\"without evaluating for *6 individualized\nreasonable suspicion\"); Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336 (\"without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion\").\nThis is not a complete answer; for one thing, at some point in the case it could still be necessary to determine\nindividually who among those who were searched were so evaluated.\nFurther, even if all persons searched based on individual evaluations were readily excluded from the class\nregardless of the soundness of the evaluation, it might still be necessary 00 at least in some cases 00 to consider\n97 97\nwhether individualized suspicion could have justified a search. Even if overbroad categories were used, the\ndefendants will likely argue that the result would have been the same for some class members even if proper\nindividualized judgments had been made 00 raising a legal issue as to liability on which we offer no opinion. \n97\nCompare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (2000) (Title VII's same decision defense as to damages). If the number\nof such instances was large, the feasibility of a class action might be compromised.\nWithout prejudging disputable issues, we think that such threats of undue complications as to liability are limited\nin this case. If there was in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially\noverlarge category, then it is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis. There\nmight yet be some number as to whom defensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made or\ncould have been made 00 two different situations with different legal implications; but whoever has the burden of\n97\n[7]\nidentifying such persons, they may well not be numerous.\nDeterminations to certify a class depend on initial prediction and are always subject to revision. Gen. Tel. Co. of\nthe S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982); Smilow, 323 F.3d at 39-40; \nMowbray, 208 F.3d at 297 n. 6. If a large number of class members turn out to present non-common issues as to\nliability, the court may have to consider narrowing or de-certifying the class. Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 297 n. 2. But a\ncourt can proceed based on its reasonable best guess as to what will happen and we share the district judges'\napparent view that the individualized-suspicion issue will arise only in a limited number of cases, assuming\nalways that plaintiffs can establish as a background fact the existence of an improperly broad strip search rule,\npolicy or custom.\nBy contrast, the presence of damage claims does weigh against class status. In certain cases (e.g., some\nsecurity frauds), formula damages are generally used. See 3 Conte & Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions §\n10:8 (4th ed.2002). Here each class member wrongly strip searched could in principle testify separately as to the\ncircumstances, emotional damage, lost wages, medical treatment, doctor bills, and so on. Indeed, the less potent\nthe available defense on liability, the more the class action might look like a bundle of individualized damage\nclaims wholly unsuited for class resolution.\nYet the need for individualized damage decisions does not ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still\ndisputed common issues as to liability. Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40. If the class action resolved liability even as to\n7 some further narrowed *7 class, this would be a legitimate function. At that point, the court would have further\noptions, such as an agreement on modest uniform damages for those not claiming special injury, with masters to\ndetermine the (potentially few) serious claims to special injury. E.g., In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 80\nF.R.D. 244 (S.D.Tex.1978).\nFailing some practical solution allowing full resolution of all class damage claims in a single case, the court could\nenter a judgment of liability, leaving class members to pursue damage claims in separate law suits. Smilow, 323\nF.3d at 40-41; accord. Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 621 (W.D.Wis.2003); Maneely v. City of\nNewburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 79 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (strip search cases). In addition, if and when liability is established\nand the remaining dispute is only the amount of damages, it is common experience that a great many claims\nsettle.\nIt remains to discuss the superiority vel non of the class action. The counties insist that individual law suits are\nfeasible. We think that only the limited number of cases where serious damage ensued would ever be brought\n\nwithout class status and that the vast majority of claims would never be brought unless aggregated because\nprovable actual damages are too small. This is a conventional argument for a class action, Amchem Prods., Inc.,\nv. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997), and it applies here.\nWhether the law should encourage the bringing of very small claims that would otherwise not be brought is a\ndifferent matter; law suits serve purposes beyond compensation, and the balance of cost and benefit doubtless\nvaries from case to case. It is enough for the superiority determination here that for most strip search claimants,\nclass status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel\naside), to establish liability and perhaps damages. E.g., Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 622; Mack v. Suffolk County, 191\nF.R.D. 16, 25 (D.Mass.2000).\nIt follows that the orders certifying the class actions must be sustained at this initial stage without prejudice to\ntheir further alteration. In further proceedings in the district court, little weight should be given to our own glancing\ndiscussion of the merits; although necessary background in reviewing the certification orders, our assessment\ncan only be preliminary, lacking the benefit of a fuller record and analyses yet to come.\nAffirmed.\n[1] The trend began with the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979). In this circuit, the leading cases are Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff's Dep't, 354 F.3d 57 (1st\nCir.2003); Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2000); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997).\n[2] Judge Hornby's order, Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 25, defines the class as: \nAll people strip-searched at the York County Jail after October 14, 1996 under a policy or custom of conducting\nstrip-searches without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion: (1) while waiting for bail to be set or for\na first court appearance after being arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or a violent\nfelony; or (2) while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a default or other warrant.\n[3]Cf. Stanton v. Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 577 (1st Cir.1999) (attorneys' fees under IDEA); Mass.\nFood Ass'n v. Mass. Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 197 F.3d 560, 567 (1st Cir.1999) (adequacy of\nrepresentation under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)).\n[4]Compare Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 622 (W.D.Wis.2003),Bynum v. District of Columbia,\n217 F.R.D. 43, 50 (D.D.C.2003),Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 76-79 (S.D.N.Y.2002),Mack v.\nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 25 (D.Mass.2000),and Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 613\n(D.Md.1983)(all certifying strip search class actions), with Klein v. DuPage County, 119 F.R.D. 29, 31-32\n(N.D.Ill.1988)(denying certification for strip search class action). There are also several unpublished opinions\ncoming out both ways.\n[5]Compare Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974)(discouraging\nany preliminary inquiry), with Gen. Tel. Co. of S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-161, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d\n740 (1982)(endorsing such an inquiry). The circuits are also divided. Compare Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter\nR.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291-93 (2d Cir.1999),and J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n. 7 (10th\nCir.1999),with Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt., Inc., 265 F.3d 178, 186-89 (3d Cir.2001),and Szabo v. Bridgeport\nMachs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 675-76 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,534 U.S. 951, 122 S.Ct. 348, 151 L.Ed.2d 263 (2001).\n[6]See Miller, 219 F.3d at 12; Swain, 117 F.3d at 12. If anything, some of the rhetoric might lead the reader to\nbelieve, quite wrongly, that every arrestee must be independently evaluated based on his or her own\ncircumstances. In reality, generalizations lie behind most so-called individual decisions and to endorse the\ngeneralization is, in substance, to endorse some categorical rules. See Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107,\n112 (1st Cir.2001).\n[7] A number of district courts say that the burden of identification is on the defendant, e.g., Blihovde, 219 F.R.D.\nat 622; Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 24; see also Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 360, 97 S.Ct.\n1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)(Title VII), but the various burden issues have not been briefed in this case, and we\ndo not resolve them.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Defendants'\narguments have been thoroughly considered and, with the qualification of enunciating the class members to\nwhom the Court's finding of liability applies, the Court will deny the Motion for Reconsideration.\nI. Class Members Included in the Summary Judgment Findings\nDefendants' motion highlights an ambiguity contained within the Summary Judgment Order. Specifically,\nDefendants' motion assumes that the Summary Judgment Order's finding of municipal liability for the strip\nsearches of misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion applies to all class members. Defendants\nassert that the Plaintiff class includes all misdemeanor detainees who were strip searched without reasonable\n[1]\nsuspicion after November 19, 1996.  Consequently, they argue, such an interpretation of the Summary\nJudgment Order leads to the unusual result of finding municipal liability for strip searches which may occur in the\nfuture. While Defendants read the Order broadly to reach such a conclusion, the Court will not follow suit.\nNeither party raised, prior to the Motion for Reconsideration, the issue of whether record evidence of the\nunconstitutional custom found by the Court applied equally to all class members' claims. Rather, the parties\nbriefed, and the Court considered, only the narrower issue of whether, based upon the record evidence, a\ntrialworthy issue existed with regard to any of the elements of Plaintiffs' class claim. Now that Defendants have\nsurfaced the issue of whether the summary judgment finding regarding the existence of an unconstitutional\ncustom at the Knox County Jail should necessarily extend to all members of the class, the Court will address that\nissue in the context of summary judgment.\nAs noted in the Summary Judgment Order, Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that there existed a\ncustom or practice of strip searching misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion, that the custom or\npractice was attributable to the municipality, and that the custom or practice was the moving force behind the\n\nconstitutional violation. Thus, in order for Plaintiffs to establish liability for a particular strip search, they must\nestablish that the custom or practice existed at the time of the constitutional violation.\nIn finding that the custom existed, the Court considered undisputed evidence of misdemeanor detainees being\n163 strip searched without reasonable suspicion from at least 1994 to at least 2003. *163 Central to the Court's\ndetermination that such a custom existed was evidence obtained from booking logs at the jail demonstrating that\ncorrections officers routinely strip searched misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion. The record,\nhowever, only contains log evidence from January of 1997 until August of 2002. While there remains some\nevidence of strip searches occurring after August of 2002, that evidence alone is insufficient to persuade the\nCourt that a reasonable factfinder would be required to conclude that there continued a custom of doing so. As\nfor strip searches occurring after November 19, 1996 but prior to January of 1997, the record contains undisputed\nevidence that both in 1994 and in 2000 corrections officers at the jail were strip searching all detainees charged\nwith misdemeanors. Based upon this and the other record evidence relied upon by the Court, and in the absence\nof any other evidence creating a trialworthy issue, any reasonable factfinder would conclude that the custom of\ndoing so continued throughout that time. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have thus far established that a custom of strip\nsearching misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion existed from November 20, 1996 through\nAugust of 2002. The Summary Judgment Order's finding of liability, therefore, only applies to searches conducted\n[2]\nwithin this time.\nII. Municipal Liability\nA. Select Pieces of Evidence\nFirst, Defendants argue that the Court misconstrued individual pieces of evidence contained in the record. They\ncontend that, in some instances, the Court drew inferences unsupported by the record, and in others, the Court\nfailed to draw reasonable inferences favorable to them, as required by the applicable summary judgment\nstandard. Although the Court deems these arguments to be without merit, because many of them are now raised\nfor the first time, the Court will briefly address each of them.\n1. Department of Corrections Jail Inspection Reports from 1994 and\n2000\nWith respect to both the 1994 and 2000 jail inspection reports, Defendants assert that \"the strongest inference\nsupported by [these] reports is that some unidentified correctional officers (those providing the information in the\nreports) conducted strip searches in 1994 and 2000.\" Motion for Reconsideration at 6 (Docket Item No. 150).\nDefendants, however, mischaracterize the evidence. Both reports conclude that \"all inmates are being strip\nsearched regardless of the crime if they are to be housed.\" These reports are uncontroverted by the record.\nInstead, Defendants attack the credibility of the evidence, arguing that the reports lack detail. \"However, a mere\nchallenge to the credibility of a movant's [evidence] without any supporting evidence does not create a genuine\nissue of material fact.\" Moreau v. Local Union No. 247, 851 F.2d 516, 519 (1st Cir.1988) (citing Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). Without any affirmative evidence\ncreating a genuine issue of material fact, the Court properly relied upon this evidence as proof that in 1994 and\n2000 \"all inmates [were] being strip searched regardless of the crime if they [were] to be housed.\"\nDefendants further challenge the relevance of this evidence, arguing that the 1994 jail inspection report is not\n164 relevant *164 for any purpose because it covers a period of time outside the scope of Plaintiffs' lawsuit. The Court\ndisagrees. The report provides information about the circumstances surrounding the search practices at the Knox\nCounty Jail as well as the knowledge of the county policymakers before the commencement of the class period.\nAccordingly, the Court's use of the evidence was proper.\n\n2. Robbins Affidavit\nSimilarly, Defendants suggest that the Court's reliance on the affidavit submitted by Jail Administrator Robbins\nwas misplaced. In granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs the Court relied, in part, on Robbins'\nstatement that through a lawsuit filed in April of 1998 he \"became aware that the jail staff were not always\nfollowing the policy and were, at least on some occasions, conducting strip searches in violation of policy\n[C-120].\" Summary Judgment Order at 26-27. Defendants now argue that the statement is irrelevant for purposes\nof the Court's inquiry because it fails to state how many correctional officers were violating the policy or for how\nlong. While Defendants are correct in observing that this single piece of evidence does not completely illuminate\nthe extent of the unconstitutional practice occurring at that time, it does provide some evidence of what was\noccurring at the jail during the class period. Moreover, the affidavit demonstrates that, even prior to the 2000 jail\ninspection report, the Jail Administrator had actual knowledge that some officers were still engaging in the\nunconstitutional practice of strip searching misdemeanor detainees. The Court did not err in considering this\nevidence.\nDefendants also contend that the Court should have inferred from this evidence that \"jail personnel were\nfollowing policy far more often than not.\" Although on summary judgment the nonmovant is entitled to the benefit\nof favorable inferences, they must be reasonable ones. The inference now sought by Defendants is in no way\nsupported by the evidence. Robbins' Affidavit does not address the practice of other corrections officers, and,\nthus, such an inference would be unreasonable.\n3. Robbins's Letter to Local Police Chiefs\nThe record evidence in this case provides that \"[i]n 2001, Jail Administrator Robbins wrote to local police chiefs\nnotifying them that the Knox County Jail would no longer provide the service of strip searching misdemeanor\narrestees on the request of arresting officers (for the purpose of discovering evidence).'\" Order at 27. Defendants\nargue that this piece of evidence is not probative of whether there was an unconstitutional practice of strip\nsearching misdemeanor detainees without reasonable suspicion because it \"allows the inference that the\narresting officer had a reasonable basis, recognized by the Fourth Amendment, to believe that such a search was\npermissible.\" Motion for Reconsideration at 8. Even crediting this inference, however, Defendants' argument falls\nshort. The Constitution requires that a corrections officer have reasonable suspicion prior to conducting a strip\nsearch of a misdemeanor detainee. The request of a police officer to strip search such a person, even for the\nstated purpose of discovering evidence, does not fulfill that constitutional requirement. Moreover, even assuming\nthat this letter does not provide some evidence of an ongoing unconstitutional practice, it is still highly probative\nof what municipal policymakers knew about the ongoing strip search practices at the jail. There remains\nsubstantial uncontroverted record evidence that there was a practice of strip searching misdemeanor detainees\nwithout reasonable suspicion. If this was not evidence of the fire itself, it undoubtedly showed the smoke rising\nover the trees.\n165  4. Intake and Release Logs\n*165\nDefendants take issue with the Court's conclusion that \"evidence of this unconstitutional practice can be easily\nverified from a review of the daily intake/release log entries.\" Opinion at 28. First, Defendants argue that the\nnumber of misdemeanor arrestees in each category during the sample period is unhelpful because the record\ndoes not establish the percentage of arrestees that were unlawfully searched during the sample. Defendants fail\nto cite any authority for the proposition that, in order to establish a custom or practice, Plaintiffs must provide \"at\nleast rough percentages\" of the frequency of the constitutional violation. Regardless of whether this practice was\nthe predominant practice among corrections officers, the log evidence provides additional proof that, for at least\nsome corrections officers, it was customary.\nIn order to create a genuine issue of material fact on this issue, Defendants now attempt to offer some of the\npercent-type evidence they assert was missing from the summary judgment record. These percentages,\n\nhowever, are not supported by the record. Specifically, the record does not support the assumptions regarding\nthe average daily arrest rate for each category, the record evidence of the number of strip searches in a given\ncategory during the sample months, or Defendants' mathematical computation of the total percentage derived\nfrom the assumed average daily arrest rate. Moreover, even if Defendants' assertions were supported by the\nrecord, they have failed to timely raise this argument. Defendants did not include such evidence in their initial\n[3]\nstatement of material facts. See Local Rule 56(f) (\"The court shall have no independent duty to search or\nconsider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties' separate statement of facts.\").\nFinally, Defendants contend that the Court erred in concluding that the strip searches evidenced by the logs were\nconducted without reasonable suspicion. Defendants now argue that, although the logs do not indicate that there\nwas reasonable suspicion, they do not require the inference that the officers were without reasonable suspicion.\nDefendants now attempt to challenge Plaintiffs' statement of facts on a basis that they previously failed to do. In\nPlaintiffs' statement of material fact they repeatedly assert that these logs demonstrate that the searches were\nconducted without reasonable suspicion. See PSMF ¶¶ 63, 66, 67. Although in response to these statements\nDefendants asserted numerous challenges to Plaintiffs' exhibit, Defendant never denied that the searches\n[4]\nevidenced by the exhibit were conducted without reasonable suspicion.  Instead, Defendants challenged\nwhether the exhibit accurately reflected the logs, and challenged specific entries as having been misinterpreted.\nPursuant to Local Rule 56, Defendants' failure to properly respond to these assertions in their response renders\n[5]\nthem admitted.\n166  B. The Evidence as a Whole\n*166\nThroughout their Motion for Reconsideration, Defendants challenge the Court's finding of municipal liability by\nisolating select pieces of the record evidence; each rooted in a distinct point in time and representing a selective\nperspective on the Knox County Jail strip search practice. They argue that each slice of evidence alone is\ninsufficient to establish the existence of an unconstitutional practice which is attributable to the County. While\nDefendants are correct that there is no one piece of evidence which, alone, suffices to carry Plaintiffs' burden,\nthey overlook the fact that the summary judgment evidence must be viewed as a whole. See Abramson v. William\nPaterson College of New Jersey, 260 F.3d 265, 276 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that \"while the individual pieces of\nevidence alone may not suffice to make out the claims asserted, we must view the record as a whole picture\"). As\ncatalogued in the Summary Judgment Order, the record consists of a tremendous amount of uncontroverted\nevidence that there was an unconstitutional practice and that county policymakers knew or should have known\nabout it. While the Court recognizes the generous standard applicable to nonmovants on summary judgment,\nDefendants have simply failed to generate a record upon which that favorable standard may afford them the\nbenefit they seek. Based upon this record, the Court is firmly convinced that no reasonable finder of fact could\nreach a contrary conclusion.\nC. Failure to Take Corrective Action\nDefendants complain that, with respect to their actions taken to correct the unconstitutional practice, the Court\nfocused too narrowly on the responses that occurred from 2000 to 2001 and ultimately judged the County's\nactions by the wrong legal standard. The Court disagrees with both claims. First, the Court considered and\ncredited all the record evidence that could arguably suggest Defendants had taken some corrective action.\nHowever, the only record evidence of alleged corrective action taken by Defendants occurred between 2000 and\n2001. Furthermore, while Defendants read First Circuit precedent literally to require only that they do \"something\"\nafter receiving notice of the unconstitutional practice, the Court notes that the \"something\" must be directed at\nstopping the unconstitutional practice. The Summary Judgment Order provided extensive analysis to support the\nCourt's conclusion that \"no reasonable person could conclude that the actions of Knox County were directed at\nstopping the practice.\" For all the reasons stated in the Summary Judgment Order, the actions taken by the\nCounty in response to this unconstitutional practice amounted to acquiescence in it.\n\nIII. Sheriff Davey's Liability\nAs with the claim of municipal liability, Plaintiffs must establish that a custom or practice of strip searching\nmisdemeanor detainees existed at the time of the constitutional violation in order to establish liability on the part\nof Sheriff Davey. Because the Court has concluded that the Summary Judgment Order's finding of a custom or\npractice does not extend beyond August of 2002, the Court's finding of liability against Sheriff Davey must be\n167 similarly limited. All of Defendants' remaining arguments made in their Motion for *167 Reconsideration regarding\nSheriff Davey's individual liability have been previously addressed by the Court in either the Summary Judgment\nOrder or, supra, in this Order. It is, therefore, unnecessary for the Court to address those arguments yet again.\nIV. Interpretation of Bell v. Wolfish\nDefendants contend that the Court erroneously assumed that the Supreme Court has held that pretrial detainees\nhave a Fourth Amendment right not to be strip searched. Even a casual reading of the Summary Judgment Order\nmakes it clear that no such assumption was a component of the Court's analysis. The First Circuit has applied the\nBell Fourth Amendment reasonableness test to determine the constitutionality of strip searches and, therefore,\nthe Court proceeded to apply that reasonableness test to the strip searches in this case.\nIV. Conclusion\nWith the clarification that the Court's finding of liability for strip searches of misdemeanor detainees does not\napply to any class member searched after August of 2002, and for the reasons stated above, the Court ORDERS\nthat Defendants Motion for Reconsideration be, and it is hereby, DENIED.\n[1] There is some dispute as to whether the Class has been closed or remains open. For purposes of this Order,\nhowever, that issue need not be addressed.\n[2] This limitation of liability renders moot Defendants' arguments regarding the Summary Judgment Order's\ndiscussion of intradepartmental memoranda entitled \"strip search practice interview,\" as that evidence consisted\nof strip searches occurring after August of 2002 and is not needed to support the Court's finding of liability.\n[3] Instead, Defendants asserted only that the record demonstrated that \"the Intake/Release Logs reveal that\nmore inmates were not strip searched than were strip searched.\" DSMF ¶ 170. As noted above, the fact that the\nunconstitutional practice was not a predominate one, is not sufficient to create a trial worthy issue in this case.\n[4] In response to two of these facts, Defendants do ultimately \"deny\" the statement and, as required by the Local\nRule, Defendants cite to numerous exhibits as support for their denial. None of these exhibits, however, cast any\nlight on whether there was reasonable suspicion for these searches. Accordingly, to the extent that Defendants\nmay have attempted to deny that fact, it was ineffective.\n[5] This failure is all the more striking when one considers that, although a portion of Defendants' Opposition to\nSummary Judgment was devoted to contesting the validity of Plaintiffs' sample evidence, even there, Defendants\nnever raised the issue of whether the logs permit the inference that the searches were conducted with\nreasonable suspicion.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The sole basis for the assertion for the\nexistence of interlocutory appeal status is the content of 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b):\n(b) When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this\nsection, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which\nthere is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order\nmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such\n255 order. The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal *255 of such action may\nthereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to\nit within ten days after the entry of the order; Provided, however, That application for an appeal\nhereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of\nAppeals or a judge thereof shall so order.\nId., (emphasis added).\nBased upon even the most cursory examination of the facial meaning of the language of § 1292(b), the orders in\nquestion do not provide any basis for an interlocutory appeal. The Motion presently before the Court provides no\narticulation of the basis for a finding that the statute provides a predicate for interlocutory appeal or any\nargumentation in support thereof. It states in a single sentence its entirely conclusory invocation of the statute:\nThis Court's decision both in the summary judgment order and the reconsideration order raise\nlegal issues sufficient to satisfy the standard for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292\n(b).\n\nDefendant's Motion for Certification, at 1. The sentence reflects no expenditure of any cognitive thought on\nunderstanding the plain meaning of the statutory provision, and Defendant makes no effort to establish the\napplicability of the statute to this case by any argumentation.\nThe statute requires, in order for interlocutory appeal status to be created, a certification by the Judge making the\ndecision. § 1292(b). That certification must be that the Judge, \"in making in a civil action an order,\" id., [that is, at\nthe time of making the order sought to be the subject of the appeal] believed three things about the order:\n(1) \"[T]hat such order involves a controlling question of law [;(2) ] as to which there is substantial\nground for difference of opinion [;] and [ (3) ] that an immediate appeal from the order may\nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. . . .\" Id. A fourth and final requirement\nof the statute is that the Judge, shall state these opinions \"in writing in such order.\" Id., (emphasis\nadded).\nIt suffices to observe in disposing of the pending Motion that none of these statutory predicates is satisfied in this\ncase, a conclusion that must be transparently clear to any reasonable person attempting a good faith\nunderstanding of the meaning of the language of the statute. Neither of the orders here sought to be made the\nsubject of interlocutory appeal contains the required certification and, in fact, no request has ever been made\nuntil the present motion by any party herein for such a certification, a fact that by itself arguably renders the\n256 present Motion untimely made[1] on the basis of the plain language *256 of the statute. Furthermore, at no time\nhas this Judge in fact entertained any of the requisite opinions that must be certified nor has it been so indicated\nin writing in either of those orders.\nIf the Court were now to consider, assuming it was proper for it to do so under the statute, whether these\nstatutory criteria exist in this case, it would conclude without doubt that they do not. Clearly, reversal of the first\nOrder granting partial summary judgment on some liability claims in the Plaintiffs' Complaint would result in\nnothing more than those liability claims being reinstated anew for resolution by trial by jury. Thus, it cannot be\nclaimed that such a result will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. This is especially true\nin view of the fact that there remain, aside from the claims determined by the Order of partial summary judgment,\na congeries of other claims and defenses to be adjudicated herein. An immediate appeal will not as a matter of\nlegal substance advance in any significant way the ultimate resolution of any aspect of this matter but will rather\ndelay any resolution.\nFurthermore, as a practical matter, counsel have been at a constant state of adamant loggerheads about\nconsidering any matter by agreement in the preparatory phases of this case, as far as the Court has observed. It\nis clear to the Court that neither side is prepared to concede on or to or step back from, any factual or legal\nproposition underlying their respective positions in this case. Both sides have demonstrated, and on inquiry have\navowed, the intent to see the case through to trial no matter what may occur. With matters in that posture, there\nis no basis to indulge the hopeful prospect that early termination of this case by settlement can be occasioned by\nquick resolution of the issues sought to be immediately appealed. However hard those issues may be taken to\nbe, it is clear that the heads of the parties and counsel are harder still.\nI CONCLUDE that an \"immediate\" appeal is not available under the statute on the present record herein. The\nmotion is hereby DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] It provides context for present purposes to note that the Court's Decision on the Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary\nJudgment was filed on November 2, 2005 (Docket Item No. 141) and that its Decision on Defendants' Motion for\nReconsideration thereof was filed on April 4, 2006 (Docket Item No. 164). A Final Pretrial Conference was held on\nApril 13, 2006. Defense Counsel indicated orally at the conference that he intended to file a motion seeking\ncertification of the issues previously decided by the Court for an interlocutory appeal. The Court admonished him\norally at that time to file the motion promptly so as not to occasion any delay of trial. The Court entered its Report\nof Final Pretrial Conference and Order (Docket Item No. 181) on April 19, 2006. It provides specifically, inter alia,\n\nDefense counsel indicated that he intended to file a Motion seeking this Court's certification of certain legal\nissues to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in advance of trial. The Court indicated [that] any such motion should\nbe promptly filed so as not to unnecessarily delay trial.\nId., ¶ 3.A., at 5.\nThe present motion was filed by defense counsel on July 8, 2006, over two and one-half months after the Pretrial\nConference and over nine months after the filing of the Court's Decision on the Plaintiffs' Summary Judgment\nMotion, which is the basal subject of the attempted appeal. The timing of the motion's filing is such that after\nexpiration of the briefing periods thereon under the Local Rules, it does not mature for action by the Court until\nAugust 29, 2006, virtually the eve of the trial as previously scheduled for September 11, 2006 and after extremely\nintensive pretrial preparations and discovery had been completed in preparation for a trial commencing on that\ndate.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

SUMMARY  \n \n  The parties agreed to settle this case on Friday, September 29, 2006 at the Judicial \nSettlement Conference with Chief Judge Singal. (Docket Item No. 328). The general \nterms of the agreement are set forth in a Settlement Agreement signed by all parties on \nSeptember 29, 2006.  Additionally, the Court will issue an injunctive Order designed to \nprevent unconstitutional strip searches in the future.  Under the Settlement Agreement, \nthe parties are required to submit, using the Second Amended Settlement Agreement \napproved in Nilsen v. York County, (02-CV-212-P-H) their final written agreement, along \nwith a Motion to Recertify the Class on or before Tuesday, November 14, 2006.  (Docket \nItem No. 368, supra). \n \n1 \n\n \n  Pursuant to the Court’s October 4, 2006 “Remark” (Docket Item No. 334), the \nparties will either jointly agree on language to be included in the injunctive Order, or will \nseparately submit proposed orders to the Court. \nThe Agreement also settles all claims of the class, including, without limitation on \nthe generality of the foregoing, claims of the class representatives and absent class \nmembers who do not opt out as provided, herein, for compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, attorneys fees and costs, and interest by establishing a common fund of Three \nMillion Dollars ($3,000,000.00), to be shared among participating class members after \npayment of attorneys fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and class representative \nbonuses.  Under this Agreement, class members will receive one payment regardless of \nthe number of times that they were booked into the jail and searched during the class \nperiod.   \nII.  TERMS\nA.  Procedural History\n  1.  Plaintiff filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, \n2003, Judge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as follows: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or visual \nbody  cavity  search  without  evaluation  for  individualized  reasonable  suspicion  while \nbeing held at the Knox County Jail: \n \n \n2 \n\n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a \nviolent felony; or \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon, \ndrugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involve a \nweapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or \na violent felony. \n \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. \n  2.  Plaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pre-trial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof  the  booking  procedure.    The  Defendants  have  denied  those  allegations  and  have \nasserted that both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and \nprocedures were at all times consistent with constitutional requirements.   \nB.  Agreement \n  1.  The parties agree that the class period begins on November 19, 1996, and ends \nDecember 31, 2004.   \n  2.  The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction the purpose of \nwhich  will  be  to  ensure the  Defendants’  compliance  with Fourth  Amendment law \ngoverning strip searches.  The parties have agreed on the terms of the injunction which \nare  set  forth  in  the  Court’s  Amended  Permanent  Injunction  Pursuant  to  Settlement \n \n3 \n\n \nAgreement (Docket Item No. 364), and all parties waive their rights to appeal the entry \nof, and the terms of this Injunctive Order.      \n  3.  An approved class action notice was sent to potential class members at their \nlast known addresses and notices were published as required by the Court after class \ncertification. No class members asked to be excluded by the opt out deadline.   \n  4.  The Defendants will pay Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) to settle all \nclaims brought by Plaintiff and class in this action including claims for attorneys’ fees, \ncosts, administrative costs, and interest by check made out to the “Knox Settlement \nFund” and delivered to class counsel no later than February 15, 2007. \n5.  The parties agree and acknowledge that the Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole and that the payment was made and other agreements contained herein were given \nwithout admission of liability, which is expressly denied, and which payment was made \nand other agreements were given by the Defendants solely for the purpose of buying their \npeace and freedom from litigation.  No language contained in this Settlement Agreement \nor any language contained in any motions for approval of settlement filed by Plaintiffs or \nin any orders by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or final approval to \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  shall  in  any  way  be  construed  as  acknowledgments  or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by the Defendants. \n  6.  The Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nfacilitate the administration of this settlement including providing access to data and \ndocuments necessary to determine class membership if a person disputes denial of a \n  4 \n\n \nclaim by the claims administrator. \n  7.  The Defendants understand that this agreement will require approval of the \nCourt.  The Defendants will ask the Court to approve the terms of the settlement. \n  8.  If Plaintiff has to incur any additional attorney time or costs to seek collection \nof the settlement fund because of a default by the Defendants in the timely performance \nof its obligations to pay under this Agreement, the Defendants may be responsible for \npayment of reasonable attorneys fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and only upon \napproval  of  the  Court.    Any  request  for  such  additional  fees  and  costs  shall  be  by \napplication to the Court with opportunity for objection by the Defendants. \n  9.    Class  counsel  will  establish  the  “Knox  Settlement  Fund”  as  a  qualified \nsettlement fund.  Once the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the entire fund \nand all interest or income resulting from the investment of the fund shall be part of the \nfund.  If the Defendants do not pay all or part of their obligation on time, the amount \nowed by that Defendant will accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year, \ncompounded daily.  Interest will only apply to the unpaid portion of the Defendant’s \nobligation. \n  10.  The Settlement Fund and any money earned by the fund will be invested in \nthe  Marshall  Money  Market  fund  which  is  AAA  rated  by  Fitch,  unless  and  until \notherwise ordered by the Court.  Class Counsel, Class Representatives, Defendants and \nDefense Counsel shall not have any responsibility or liability for the investment of the \nSettlement Fund.  If the Court does not give final approval to the settlement, the Plaintiffs \n  5 \n\n \nwill return the amount paid to the Defendants. \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION\n  1.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders as \nappropriate to enforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and to \neffect fair and orderly administration. \n  2.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Settlement Agreement may be \nchanged by the Court on a showing of good cause. \nIV.  HEARING\n  1.  The Court will schedule a hearing to decide whether to grant preliminary \napproval to the settlement, recertify the class for settlement purposes and to issue a \npermanent Injunctive Order.  If approval is granted, the parties will begin to implement \nthe settlement.  The Defendants will make their payment as specified hereinabove, and \nthe Plaintiffs will send the approved notice to the class.   \n  2.  The Court will hold a final fairness hearing to decide whether to grant final \napproval of settlement on April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m..   \n  3.  If the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the Knox Settlement Fund \nwill belong to the Plaintiff and the class, and the Defendants will no longer have any right \nto, title to, or interest in the funds.  The funds will then be distributed pursuant to orders \nof the Court. \n  6 \n\n \nV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR\n  1. Class counsel requests that the firm of Analytics, Inc. of Chanhassen, Minnesota \nbe approved by the Court as Claims Administrator.  The Declaration of Richard Simmons \nand the qualifications of Analytics, Inc. are attached hereto as Exhibit E. \n  2.    Class  counsel  recommends  that  the  Claims  Administrator  be  permitted  to \ndesignate an attorney as agent in Knox County to distribute checks to any claimants who \nwish to pick up their check.  This agent will be paid by the Claims Administrator for \nperforming this service. \n  3.    The  Claims  Administrator  will  administer  notice  to  class  members  in  the \nmanner prescribed by the Court; shall accept and docket all claims; shall send all notices \nthat a claim has been accepted or rejected to class members; shall resolve any appeals of \nclaim denials; shall calculate the amount of each claim pursuant to the formula set out in \nthis Agreement; and shall report to the Court as necessary, including providing a final \nreport. \n  4.  Class counsel will oversee settlement administration and will provide direction \nto the Claims Administrator as needed. \nVI.  NOTICE, OBJECTIONS, CLAIMS AND OPT OUT\n  1.  Class counsel will send a Notice of Class Action Settlement and of the Hearing \nto  Approve  the  Settlement  (“Notice  of  Settlement”),  a  Settlement  Claim  Form,  a \nFrequently Asked Questions sheet and an Opt Out Form, by first class mail postage \nprepaid to all potential class members, whose addresses are known to class counsel, at \n  7 \n\n \ntheir last known address within three weeks after the Court’s order granting preliminary \napproval.  If any mail is returned by the post office with notice of a more current address, \nclass counsel will resend the notice to that address.  Class counsel is not required to make \nany further efforts to send mail directly to class members.  A Notice of Settlement and \nSettlement Claim Form and/or an Opt Out Form will be made available to anyone who \nrequests such information.  Claim Forms and Opt Out forms will be available to be \ndownloaded  from  the  web  site  or  on  request  to  the  Claims  Administrator  including \nthrough a toll free number. \n  2.  The Notice of Settlement will include the terms of the settlement (attached as \nExhibit A) and the class member’s right to contest the settlement.  This Notice includes \nFrequently Asked Questions which explain the settlement terms and answer anticipated \nquestions.  Attached as Exhibit F is the envelope to be used for mailing the proposed \nNotice of Settlement.   \n  3.  The Settlement Claim Form requests the class member’s contact information, \naffirmation that he or she meets the class definition, instructions for check delivery, and a \nForm W-9.  The proposed settlement claim form is attached as Exhibit B. \n  4.  The proposed Opt Out/Exclusion Form requests the class members’ contact \ninformation, affirmation that he or she meets the class definition and a statement by the \nclass member that he or she wishes to opt out and be excluded from participating in the \nclass action settlement.  The proposed Opt Out/Exclusion form is attached at Exhibit G. \n  5.  Class counsel will also publish notice of the settlement twice in the Portland \n  8 \n\n \nPress Herald, Rockland Courier Gazette and the Bangor Daily News.  This notice is \nattached as Exhibit C.  The Defendant agrees to post the notice for publication attached as \nExhibit C in the intake/booking area as well as in one area frequented by inmates in each \nof the separate pods at the jail.  The notices will be posted as soon as the Court approves \nthe mailing of a class wide notice of proposed settlement attached as Exhibit A, and will \nremain up until the last day that the settlement claim forms can be filed.  In addition, the \nDefendant has agreed to make available during the same timeframe defined in the prior \nsentence,  to  inmates  (or  anyone  else)  who  requests  it,  a  copy  of  the  Notice  of  the \nSettlement attached as Exhibit A and counsel for the class will provide the County with \n500 copies.   \n  6.    In  addition  to  the  legal  notices,  class  counsel  will  issue  a  press  release \ninforming the public of the settlement.  The press release is attached as Exhibit D. \n  7.    Class  counsel,  through  the  Claims  Administrator,  will  establish  a  website \n(www.knoxcountyjailclass.com) which will include the Notice of Settlement (Exhibit A) \nand the Settlement Claim Form (Exhibit B).   \n  8.  The Claims Administrator will send a claim form and/or opt out/exclusion form \nto anyone who requests one before the time for filing claim forms has expired.  In \naddition,  the  Claims  Administrator  will  maintain  updated  documents  regarding  this \nsettlement on the website including a claim form which can be printed and mailed. The \nClaims  Administrator  will  also  establish,  within  three  weeks  after  the  Court  grants \npreliminary approval of this settlement, and maintain a toll-free number for claimants to \n  9 \n\n \ncall with questions about the claim form. This number will be operational for at least five \n(5) months. \n  9.  In order for a class member to claim a share of the settlement, he or she must \nsubmit a valid and complete Settlement Claim Form postmarked no later than February \n12, 2007.  This deadline is called the “Claims Deadline”. \n10.  Class members have the right to be excluded from the settlement class   \npursuant to Rule 23 (c) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and as provided \nherein.  To do so, a class member must mail a written request to the claims administrator \nat Dare Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2006 Chanhassen, MN 55317-2006.  In order for \na class member to opt out and be excluded from participation in the proposed settlement, \nhe or she must submit an opt out/exclusion form to the claims administrator postmarked \nno later than February 12, 2007. This deadline is called the “Opt Out Deadline”. \n  11.  In order for a class member to object to the proposed settlement, he or she \nmust submit written notice of the objection to the Claims Administrator.  In addition, an \nobjector may also appear in person or through counsel at the final fairness hearing when \nthe objection will be considered by the Court.  The Claims Administrator will forward all \nletters of objection to the Court and to counsel for all parties.  (The class member must \nalso submit a Settlement Claim Form if he or she wishes to be eligible to share in the \nsettlement should it be approved despite his or her objection.) \n  12.  Settlement Claim Forms received by the Claims Administrator within two \nweeks after the Claims Deadline will be treated as if postmarked by the Claims Deadline.  \n  10 \n\n \nThis two-week grace is the Amnesty Period. \n  13.  Notwithstanding paragraph 12 above, claim forms will be treated as filed in a \ntimely manner if either (1) the form is received by the Claims Administrator by no later \nthan February 12, 2007, or (2) if a request to permit additional time to file a claim form is \nreceived by the Court by no later than  February 12, 2007 and the related claim form is \nreceived by the Claims Administrator by no later than February 26, 2007. Claim forms \nreceived after February 26, 2007 will be denied as untimely. \n  14.  Opt Out Forms received by the Claims Administrator within two weeks after \nthe Opt Out Deadline will be treated as if postmarked by the Opt Out Deadline.  This \ntwo-week grace period is the Amnesty Period. \n  15.  Notwithstanding paragraph 14 above, Opt Out Forms will be treated as filed \nin a timely manner if either (1) the form is received by the Claims Administrator by no \nlater than February 12, 2007, or (2) if a request to permit additional time to file an Opt \nOut Form is received by the Court by no later than February 12, 2007 and the related Opt \nOut Form is received by the Claims Administrator by no later than February 26, 2007. \nOpt Out Forms received after February 26, 2007 will be denied as untimely.   \nVII.  APPROVALS AND APPEALS\n  1.  The Claims Administrator will review each claim form to determine that the \nclaimant is a class member by confirming (a) that the Settlement Claim Form is timely \nand valid, (b) that the information on the form is consistent with available booking data \npreviously provided by the Defendants, and (c) that the Form is completely filled out and \n  11 \n\n \nsigned.   \n  2.  The Claims Administrator may, in its discretion, waive a technical defect in the \nClaim Form to achieve substantial justice. \n  3.  If the booking data indicates that the person does not meet the class definition, \nthe Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant.  The denial \nnotice will indicate the reason or reasons for the denial. These would include (a) not at \nthe jail during the class period, (b) no booking for an offense within the class definition, \nor (c) that the person was not strip searched while being held awaiting bail or a first court \nappearance.  The denial notice also will indicate how to appeal the denial and the time \ndeadline for filing a written notice of appeal to the Claims Administrator and the Court.  \nBecause the booking data is sometimes inaccurate or non-descriptive as to whether a \nperson  was  strip  searched,  the  Claims  Administrator  may  accept  the  Claimant’s \naffirmation of strip search.   \n  4.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s determination that he or she is \nnot  a  class  member,  a  claimant  must  file  a  written  notice  of  appeal  to  the  Claims \nAdministrator postmarked no later than two (2) weeks after the date of the mailing on the \nNotice of Claim Denial.  He or she may include written documentation that shows that he \nor she is a class member, and he or she may also include a written statement.  Those \nobjections  claiming  that  a  person  who  otherwise  met  the  class  definition  was  strip \nsearched will be reviewed against available records of the Defendants to determine if the \nperson was strip searched.  The Claims Administrator will make a determination on each \n  12 \n\n \nappeal no later than eight (8) weeks after the deadline for class members to file such \nappeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in writing of their \ndetermination  and  will  provide  copies  to  all  counsel.    Rulings  by  the  Claims \nAdministrator will be final and binding, except that a Claimant is allowed to appeal a \ndenial of a claim directly to the Court. \n  5.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval (“Notice of \nClaim Approval”) to each approved claimant promptly but in no event later than one \nweek after the Court grants final approval of the settlement.   \n  6.  A claimant who used a different name at booking must present documentation \nestablishing that he or she is the person referred to in the booking records.  \n  7.  The Claims Administrator will review each opt out/exclusion form and \nnotify the class member in writing that the form was received timely and that the class \nmember has been excluded from participating in the class action settlement and the \nclaims administrator will provide copies to all counsel.   \n \nVIII.  EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS FEES\n  1.  Administrative costs, including the Claims Administrator’s fees and expenses, \nwill be paid from the Settlement Fund.   \n  2.  Class counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of Plaintiff’s attorneys \nfees and out-of-pocket costs in the amount of thirty percent (30%) of the settlement fund.  \nThese fees and costs shall be paid at the same time as the distribution of the Settlement \n  13 \n\n \nFund to class members.  In addition, class counsel will ask the Court to deduct from the \nsettlement  funds  an  amount  sufficient  to  pay  the  costs  of  further  litigation  and  the \nexpenses of claims administration.  The parties understand that the Court shall have the \ndiscretion to award whatever fees and costs it deems justified based upon the submissions \nby the class counsel in support of those fees and costs.   \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS\n  1.  Class counsel recommends to the Court that the Claims Administrator pay \nbonuses from the Settlement Fund to compensate the class representative for the time that \nhe  spent  on  this  case  and  his  loss  of  privacy  as  a  result  of  serving  as  a  Class \nRepresentative.  Class counsel also recommends a bonus to compensate the 19 class \nmembers whose depositions were taken by defense counsel for the time they spent.  Class \ncounsel recommends a bonus of $5,000.00 to the class representative of record as of the \ndate of the final approval of this settlement.  Class counsel recommends a bonus of \n$500.00 to each of the 19 class members who were deposed by the Defendants.  These \nchecks will be issued at the same time as payments to class members. \n  2.  Class members will receive payment from the common fund after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants. \n  3.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \nmember by providing one share for every class member with an approved claim.

Class members will receive one payment even if they were booked into the jail \nand strip searched more than one time during the class period. \n  5.  Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \nmember’s estate or the person filing an affidavit in compliance with the Maine Procedure \nfor  Collection  of  Personal  Property  by  Affidavit  of  the  Rightful  Heir  under  18-A \nM.R.S.A. § 3-1201, or the equivalent procedure of the law of another state that governs \nthe estate of the deceased class member.  A check will be mailed to the class member at \ntheir mailing address or it may be picked up.  Any change of address request must be \nmade in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n  6.    If  a  participating  class  member  is  confined  in  a  prison,  hospital  or  other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck  will  be  sent  to  that  address  unless  the  class  member  makes  other  acceptable \narrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator. \nX.

Knox County Civil Action No. 02-251-PC \n \nYou could get a payment from a $3 million dollar class \naction settlement if you meet all of the following conditions: \n \n  1.  You were held at the Knox County Jail during the period November 19, 1996 to  \nDecember 31, 2004. \n \n  2.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first \ncourt appearance.  This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n \n  3.  You were not charged with a crime involving drugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \n  4.  You were strip searched without evaluation to determine if there was a reason to  \n    Suspect possession of hidden contraband. \n \nA strip search process is one in which you were required to remove all of your clothes while a \ncorrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body.  In some cases, the officer may have required \nyou to either squat cough and open your mouth or expose your body cavity while a corrections officer \ninspected and viewed your naked body. \n   \nA federal Court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \n•  A $3 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about alleged illegal strip \nsearches that took place when people were strip searched at the Knox County Jail while \nbeing held prior to trial. \n \n•  The settlement fund will pay cash to those who submit valid claims after deducting attorney’s \nfees, and the costs and expenses for this case. \n \n•  The settlement prohibits the Knox County Jail from continuing the policy, custom and \npractice of strip searching people held prior to trial, charged with crimes not involving drugs, \nweapons or a violent felony. \n \n  Your legal rights are affected if you act or do not act. Please Read this Notice Carefully \n \nYou are receiving this notice because records show that you may be a class member. To see if you \nqualify, you must submit a complete Settlement Claim Form, postmarked by February 12, 2007, to:  \n                 \n  Dare Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2006, Chanhassen, MN 55317-2006 \n \nIf you submit a claim form and qualify as a class member, you will share in this settlement. The amount \nof money you will receive depends on how many people submit claim forms. The money will be divided \nby the number of claims. Lawyers for the plaintiffs believe that over seven thousand people are eligible \nmembers of the Class.  \n \nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n1\n\nYou have the right to opt out or request to be excluded from the settlement class.

Read the remaining \nparagraphs of this notice so that you fully understand what it means to opt out or exclude yourself \nfrom this settlement and what you have to do to be excluded. \n \n \nTHESE ARE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT:  \nSubmit a Claim Form   This is the only way to get a payment. Remember: Claim Forms \npostmarked after February 12, 2007 will not be considered for payment. \nObject  You must write to the Court explaining why you believe the settlement is not \nfair by February 12, 2007. Second, you must appear in Court at the Fairness \nHearing on April 23, 2007.  Third, you must also submit a claim form. \nDo Nothing  You get no payment.

You will not be bound by the settlement and you will \nkeep your right to sue the Defendant on these claims, if the statute of \nlimitations has not run on your claim.   \n \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS – WHAT YOU GET AND HOW TO GET IT \n \nHow much will my payment be? \n \nWe do not know the amount of the payments. If you are eligible you will get a payment for only one \nstrip search. The amount will depend on how many people submit claim forms.  The amount per person \nwill decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. Each participating person will receive an \nequal amount. \n \nThe settlement money will be distributed after payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses and bonuses. \nCounsel requests a 30% attorney’s fee, which includes all costs, expenses and disbursements.  Class \ncounsel requests payment of a bonus to the class representative and class members who were deposed to \ncompensate them for the time they spent helping to bring about this settlement and for the loss of \nprivacy to the class representative. The requested bonuses range from $500.00 for participating in a \ndeposition to $5,000.00 for serving as class representative. The total amount of the requested bonuses is \n$14,500.00, less than 1% of the total settlement. \n \nHow can I get a payment? \n \nYou must fill out the Settlement Claim Form completely and mail it to the Claims Administrator. A \nClaim Form is included with this notice. You can also obtain a Claim Form from the Settlement Website \nat www.knoxcountyjailclass.com.

Your check will be \nsent to your mailing address. If you move, you must notify the Claims Administrator in writing of your \nnew address or the check will be sent to your old address. \n \nWhen will I get my payment? \n \nYou cannot be paid until the settlement is approved by the Court and any appeals are over. The Court \nwill hold a hearing on April 23, 2007, to decide whether to approve the settlement.  If the Court \napproves the settlement and all appeals are completed promptly, you should receive your settlement \ncheck by June 1, 2007, unless there are any unforeseen delays.  \n \nWill I have to pay taxes on my payment? \n \nYou may have to pay taxes on your payment. You should consult your tax preparer when you file your \ntax returns. The Claims Administrator will send you a 1099 Form. (If you have questions about backup \nwithholding, Form W-9 or Form 1099, call your tax preparer or the IRS Information Reporting Program \nCustomer Service Section, toll free at (866) 455-7438, 8:30 am to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.) \n \nWhat should I do if I do not want to participate in the class action? \n \nIf you do not wish to participate in the class action, do nothing.  If you do not send in a claim form you \nwill not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment. You will also be barred \nfrom filing a case on these claims in the future. \n \nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT \n \nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\n \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Dale Dare), sued on \nbehalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of the people who were similarly treated are known as \nthe Class or Class Members.  One court resolves the issues for all Class Members.   \n \nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the settlement?\n \nThe Court has ruled that you are a Class Member if you meet all four factors below: \n \n1.   You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December 31, 2004. \n2.   You were held at Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first court \nappearance. This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n3.   You were not charged with a crime involving drugs or weapons or a violent felony. \n4.   You were strip searched before a first court appearance or while awaiting bail. \n \nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip searched while you were serving a \nsentence, (2) you were strip searched after an evaluation which determined there was reason to suspect \npossession of hidden contraband., or (3) you were arrested for and/or charged with a crime involving \ndrugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n\n \nWhat crimes are considered to be violent felonies?\n \nThe following crimes are violent felonies: aggravated assault, arson, assault on an officer, criminal \nrestraint, elevated aggravated assault, gross sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, murder, rape, and \nrobbery. This list is non-exclusive, and other felony level crimes may be determined to be “violent”. \n \nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime? \n \nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership. If any one of the charges \nwas a crime involving weapons or drugs or was a violent felony, you are not a class member for that \narrest. You might be eligible for another arrest. \n \nWhat if I was arrested on a default warrant of violation of probation or parole? \n   \nYou are a class member if you were arrested on a default or other warrant or for violating the terms of \nprobation or parole so long as the crime for which you were on probation did not involve weapons, or \nrugs, or a violent felony. \n \nWho makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member? \n \nThe Class Administrator makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member subject to \nCourt review. The booking records kept by the Knox County Jail will help determine if you are a class \nmember. You can help by listing the date or dates when you feel you met the class definition.  If the \nrecords do not show that you fit the class definition, your claim will be denied. You can appeal your \ndenial to the claims administrator by sending documentation and information regarding the dates you \nbelieve you were held and strip searched.  A decision by the Claims Administrator can be appealed to \nthe Judge.  (If you are not a class member, you are not bound by this settlement. You can take action as \nan individual if you wish.) \n \nWhat if I was arrested and strip searched more than once, can I still participate? \n \nYes. If you were arrested and brought to the Jail more than once during the class period you are a \nmember of the class and can recover money. You can only recover one payment, however, as you will \nnot be provided with extra payments if you were arrested and strip searched at the jail more than one \ntime. \n \nWhat if I was at the jail on or before November 18, 1996 or after December 31, 2004?\n \nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be filed \nwithin a certain time period; this is called the statute of limitations.  The law in Maine only allows a \nperson to bring a claim within six years after his or her rights were violated.  Because this case was filed \non or about November 19, 2002, class members include anyone strip-searched in the six years before \nthat date.  If you were strip-searched on or before November 18, 1996, it may be too late to bring a \nlawsuit.  The time period for the class ends on December 31, 2004. If you were strip-searched after this \ndate, that search is not a part of this lawsuit; you must file your own lawsuit.  \n \nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n4\n \n\n \n \nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime. \n \nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the settlement? \n \nIf you are still unsure as to whether you are a member of the class, you may fill out and return the \nSettlement Claim Form.  If the settlement is approved, you will be notified if you do not qualify. If you \nqualify you will receive a check.  You may also visit the settlement website on the Internet at \nwww.knoxcountyjailclass.com or call (877) 797-5732 to speak to a Settlement Administrator or Class \nCounsel to answer your questions.  \n \nHow did the lawyers in this case find me and how can I protect my privacy? \n \nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address at the Knox County Jail during booking.  This \ninformation was given to the lawyers for the plaintiffs by Knox County pursuant to a court order. The \nlawyers for the plaintiffs will do everything they can to protect your privacy.  Only the lawyers in the \ncase and the Court appointed Claims Administrator will know your name and, in most cases, only the \nClaims Administrator will see your Claim Form.  \n \nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING \n \nWhat is a Fairness Hearing? \n \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.  The Court will consider \nwhether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. The Court will also decide whether to approve \nthe request for attorney’s fees, costs, expenses and the bonuses to class representatives. If the Court \napproves the proposed settlement, it will affect all class members.      \n \nWhen and where is the hearing? \n \nThe Hearing will be held on April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 \nFederal Street, Portland, ME.  \n \nDo I have to come to the hearing? \n \nClass counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. You are welcome to come at your own \nexpense.

Knox County Civil Action No. 02-251-PC \n \nYou could get a payment from a $3 million dollar class \naction settlement if you meet all of the following conditions: \n \n  1.  You were held at the Knox County Jail during the period November 19, 1996 to  \nDecember 31, 2004. \n \n  2.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first \ncourt appearance.  This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n \n  3.  You were not charged with a crime involving drugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \n  4.  You were strip searched without evaluation to determine if there was a reason to  \n    Suspect possession of hidden contraband. \n \nA strip search process is one in which you were required to remove all of your clothes while a \ncorrections officer inspected and viewed your naked body.  In some cases, the officer may have required \nyou to either squat cough and open your mouth or expose your body cavity while a corrections officer \ninspected and viewed your naked body. \n   \nA federal Court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \n•  A $3 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about alleged illegal strip \nsearches that took place when people were strip searched at the Knox County Jail while \nbeing held prior to trial. \n \n•  The settlement fund will pay cash to those who submit valid claims after deducting attorney’s \nfees, and the costs and expenses for this case. \n \n•  The settlement prohibits the Knox County Jail from continuing the policy, custom and \npractice of strip searching people held prior to trial, charged with crimes not involving drugs, \nweapons or a violent felony. \n \n  Your legal rights are affected if you act or do not act. Please Read this Notice Carefully \n \nYou are receiving this notice because records show that you may be a class member. To see if you \nqualify, you must submit a complete Settlement Claim Form, postmarked by February 12, 2007, to:  \n                 \n  Dare Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2006, Chanhassen, MN 55317-2006 \n \nIf you submit a claim form and qualify as a class member, you will share in this settlement. The amount \nof money you will receive depends on how many people submit claim forms. The money will be divided \nby the number of claims. Lawyers for the plaintiffs believe that over seven thousand people are eligible \nmembers of the Class.  \n \nQuestions?

If you are eligible you will get a payment for only one \nstrip search. The amount will depend on how many people submit claim forms.  The amount per person \nwill decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. Each participating person will receive an \nequal amount. \n \nThe settlement money will be distributed after payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses and bonuses. \nCounsel requests a 30% attorney’s fee, which includes all costs, expenses and disbursements.  Class \ncounsel requests payment of a bonus to the class representative and class members who were deposed to \ncompensate them for the time they spent helping to bring about this settlement and for the loss of \nprivacy to the class representative.

You should consult your tax preparer when you file your \ntax returns. The Claims Administrator will send you a 1099 Form. (If you have questions about backup \nwithholding, Form W-9 or Form 1099, call your tax preparer or the IRS Information Reporting Program \nCustomer Service Section, toll free at (866) 455-7438, 8:30 am to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.) \n \nWhat should I do if I do not want to participate in the class action? \n \nIf you do not wish to participate in the class action, do nothing.  If you do not send in a claim form you \nwill not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment. You will also be barred \nfrom filing a case on these claims in the future. \n \nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT \n \nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\n \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Dale Dare), sued on \nbehalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of the people who were similarly treated are known as \nthe Class or Class Members.  One court resolves the issues for all Class Members.   \n \nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the settlement?\n \nThe Court has ruled that you are a Class Member if you meet all four factors below: \n \n1.   You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December 31, 2004. \n2.   You were held at Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first court \nappearance. This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n3.   You were not charged with a crime involving drugs or weapons or a violent felony. \n4.   You were strip searched before a first court appearance or while awaiting bail. \n \nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip searched while you were serving a \nsentence, (2) you were strip searched after an evaluation which determined there was reason to suspect \npossession of hidden contraband., or (3) you were arrested for and/or charged with a crime involving \ndrugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n \n\n \nWhat crimes are considered to be violent felonies?\n \nThe following crimes are violent felonies: aggravated assault, arson, assault on an officer, criminal \nrestraint, elevated aggravated assault, gross sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, murder, rape, and \nrobbery. This list is non-exclusive, and other felony level crimes may be determined to be “violent”. \n \nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime? \n \nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership. If any one of the charges \nwas a crime involving weapons or drugs or was a violent felony, you are not a class member for that \narrest. You might be eligible for another arrest. \n \nWhat if I was arrested on a default warrant of violation of probation or parole? \n   \nYou are a class member if you were arrested on a default or other warrant or for violating the terms of \nprobation or parole so long as the crime for which you were on probation did not involve weapons, or \nrugs, or a violent felony. \n \nWho makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member? \n \nThe Class Administrator makes the final decision about who qualifies as a Class Member subject to \nCourt review. The booking records kept by the Knox County Jail will help determine if you are a class \nmember. You can help by listing the date or dates when you feel you met the class definition.  If the \nrecords do not show that you fit the class definition, your claim will be denied. You can appeal your \ndenial to the claims administrator by sending documentation and information regarding the dates you \nbelieve you were held and strip searched.  A decision by the Claims Administrator can be appealed to \nthe Judge.  (If you are not a class member, you are not bound by this settlement. You can take action as \nan individual if you wish.) \n \nWhat if I was arrested and strip searched more than once, can I still participate? \n \nYes. If you were arrested and brought to the Jail more than once during the class period you are a \nmember of the class and can recover money. You can only recover one payment, however, as you will \nnot be provided with extra payments if you were arrested and strip searched at the jail more than one \ntime. \n \nWhat if I was at the jail on or before November 18, 1996 or after December 31, 2004?\n \nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be filed \nwithin a certain time period; this is called the statute of limitations.  The law in Maine only allows a \nperson to bring a claim within six years after his or her rights were violated.  Because this case was filed \non or about November 19, 2002, class members include anyone strip-searched in the six years before \nthat date.  If you were strip-searched on or before November 18, 1996, it may be too late to bring a \nlawsuit.  The time period for the class ends on December 31, 2004. If you were strip-searched after this \ndate, that search is not a part of this lawsuit; you must file your own lawsuit.  \n \nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\nQuestions? Call Toll Free (877) 797-5732 or visit www.knoxcountyjailclass.com. \n4\n \n\n \n \nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime. \n \nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the settlement? \n \nIf you are still unsure as to whether you are a member of the class, you may fill out and return the \nSettlement Claim Form.  If the settlement is approved, you will be notified if you do not qualify. If you \nqualify you will receive a check.  You may also visit the settlement website on the Internet at \nwww.knoxcountyjailclass.com or call (877) 797-5732 to speak to a Settlement Administrator or Class \nCounsel to answer your questions.  \n \nHow did the lawyers in this case find me and how can I protect my privacy? \n \nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address at the Knox County Jail during booking.  This \ninformation was given to the lawyers for the plaintiffs by Knox County pursuant to a court order. The \nlawyers for the plaintiffs will do everything they can to protect your privacy.  Only the lawyers in the \ncase and the Court appointed Claims Administrator will know your name and, in most cases, only the \nClaims Administrator will see your Claim Form.  \n \nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING \n \nWhat is a Fairness Hearing? \n \nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.

The Court will also decide whether to approve \nthe request for attorney’s fees, costs, expenses and the bonuses to class representatives. If the Court \napproves the proposed settlement, it will affect all class members.      \n \nWhen and where is the hearing? \n \nThe Hearing will be held on April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 \nFederal Street, Portland, ME.  \n \nDo I have to come to the hearing? \n \nClass counsel will answer any questions the Court may have.

Procedural History \n  Plaintiffs filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, 2003, \nJudge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine granted \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action under \nFed.R. Civ. P 23 (b) (3).  The class was defined as follows: \n1 \n\nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or \nvisual body cavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion \nwhile being held at the Knox County Jail: \n(1)  After having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, \nor a violent felony; or     \n(2)  While waiting for bail to be set up on charges that did not involve a \nweapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n(3)  While waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n(4)   After having been arrested on a warrant at that did not involve a weapon, \ndrugs, or a violent felony.  (See Docket Item No. 21) \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court \nof Appeals for the First Circuit, Tardiff vs. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004). \nPlaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pretrial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof a booking procedure.  The defendants have denied those allegations and have asserted \nthat both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and procedures \nwere at all times consistent with constitutional requirements. \nThis case has been in litigation since November, 2002.  Partial Summary  \nJudgment was granted to the plaintiffs on November 2, 2005.  The Court ordered a small \nrollback of the Partial Summary Judgment in April of 2006 requiring Plaintiffs to prove \n2 \n\nan unconstitutional custom and practice for class members strip-searched between \nSeptember 2002 and December 2004.   A trial, originally scheduled to begin April 1, \n2006, was postponed until May 1, 2006 and then to October 3, 2006. The parties, like the  \nfamed the light brigade, charged into summer with no thought to what September would \nbring.  The parties interviewed, deposed, motioned and strategized fiercely aiming for the \nkiller strike that would put them a leg up and demoralize the other side.  On September 5, \n2006 court decertified the class with respect to damages, disqualified all witnesses, \nshredded all exhibits and denied all motions.  The parties retreated, seeking shelter in the \nchambers of Chief Judge Singal.  On September 29 Chief Judge Singal brought the battle \nto a close through an all day Judicial Settlement Conference.1  Following instructions of \nChief Judge Singal to prepare a final written agreement using the Second Amended \nAgreement approved in Nilsen v. York County, (02-CV-212-P.-H.), the parties began the \nprocess while hammering out that final agreement.  On December 18, 2006 the Court \nrewarded the parties' efforts by approving preliminarily the Third Final Settlement \nAgreement.  (Docket Item No.:  378). \nII.   SUMMARY OF SETTLEMENT TERMS \nThe Settlement reached by the parties secures a remarkable recovery for class \nmembers.  Under the settlement, the Defendants have created a settlement fund of $3 \nmillion dollars from which payments to class members, class representatives, class \ncounsel, and the Claims Administrator will be made.  This is an extraordinary outcome \n                                                 \n1 The parties had previously attempted to mediate the dispute with the assistance of former Maine Supreme Judicial \nCourt Chief Justice Daniel Wathen.  The two days spent with the Chief Justice Wathen brought focus to the parties' \nperceptions but did not resolve the case. \n3 \n\nfor the Class because approximately 366 class members will share in a fund which will \npay them significantly more than they might have received had they gone individually to \ntrial. \n  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, each class member who timely \nsubmits a completed and signed claim form postmarked no later than February 12, 2007, \nwill, if his claim is approved, receive a payment from the common fund (after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants) calculated on the basis of \none share for every class member with an approved claim.  Class members wishing to opt \nout of the settlement are required to file a properly executed to opt-out form on or before \nFebruary 12, 2007. \n  In the terms of the settlement agreement, a portion of the settlement fund shall be \nused, subject to Court approval, to pay the cost of administering the settlement as well as \na plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses.  Class counsel hereby apply to the Court for an \naward of attorney's fees in the amount of $900,000.00 (which represents 30% of the \nsettlement fund of 3 million), for reimbursement of $178,561.41in expenses, and for \n$35,0002 to cover the estimated Cost of Administering the Settlement.  \nThe settlement agreement also provides for an incentive award in the amount of \n$5,000 for the class representative of record as of the date of the Final Approval of the \n                                                 \n2 Analytics initial estimate of claims administrative expenses was $35,000.00 (see Exhibit B, Motion for Attorney’s Fees , Cost \nOf Litigation And Expenses Of Settlement Administration), class counsel had paid Analytics $8,684.33 and have another invoice \nin transit in the amount of $21,933.37, for a total to date of $30,617.70 in claims administration expenses.  Analytics will provide \nan updated estimate of the expenses expected to be necessary to close out the claims administration phase of this case.   \n \n4 \n\nsettlement and a $500 bonus for each of the 20 class members who were deposed by the \ndefendants. \n  The Settlement Agreement will completely settle and resolve this class action.  \nUnless a class member opted out by the timely submission of a valid opt-out form, the \nsettlement will fully bind all members of the class.  As the settlement agreement \nprovides: \"in consideration of the settlement amount, all defendants,... will be released \nfrom all liability for the class members’ claims for unlawful strip searches that were part \nof this lawsuit, including class members who do not file claims, except for any class \nmembers who requested exclusion, opted out, and filed an individual lawsuit within the \napplicable statute of limitations.  The parties have expressly agreed that the release of \nclaims arising from the settlement includes all visual inspections, including without \nlimitation visual body cavity inspections, that otherwise fall within the scope of the \nclaims certified as a class action by the Court in this case.  The parties further agree that \nthis release of claims applies to any claims that the strip searches were conducted in a \nmanner that was unlawful, including without limitation, claims of physical touching, \ncross- gender searches, or searches which were observed by persons other than the \ncorrectional officer performing the search.  The parties further agree that their settlement \ndoes not release any other claims, such as wrongful arrest, excessive force, or searches \nthat were not part of the admissions process (such as strip searches after a lockdown).” \n  Class members have been notified of the settlement pursuant to the Notice Plan \napproved by the Court in its Order granting preliminary approval of the settlement \n5 \n\n(Docket item No.  376-2). First, a Notice Package consisting of a Notice of Class Action \nSettlement and of the Hearing to Approve the Settlement (\"Notice of Settlement\"), a \nSettlement Claim Form, a Frequently Asked Questions sheet and an Opt-Out Form, by \nfirst-class mail postage prepaid to all potential class members, whose addresses are \nknown to Class Counsel at their last known address within three weeks after the Court \nOrder granting preliminary approval.  Second, creation of a website, www \nknoxcountyjailclass.com, where Notice of Settlement and the Settlement Claim Form and \nthe Opt-Out Form are available for downloading from the website or on request to the \nClaims Administrator including through a toll-free number. Third, publication of the \nNotice of Settlement twice in the Portland Press Herald, Rockland Courier Gazette and \nthe Bangor Daily News.  Fourth, posting the Notice of Settlement in the Knox County \nJail. Fifth, the issuance of a press release detailing preliminary approval of the settlement, \nhow to obtain the appropriate Claims and Opt-Out Forms, the dead-line for filing and \nNotice of the date and time of the Final Fairness Hearing. Sixth, by letter dated March 30, \n2007, sent by first class mail, postage prepaid to all 366 approved class members, class \ncounsel again notified all class members of the Fairness Hearing scheduled before the \nCourt on April 23, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. and conveyed to all class members complete copies \nof Plaintiffs Motions for Final Settlement Approval and for Award of Attorney’s Fees, \nLitigation Expenses and Administrative Costs.  \nIII.  ATTORNEY’S FEES \n6 \n\n  Class counsel respectively request the Court award attorney’s fees in the amount \nof $900,000.00, an amount equal to 30% of the principal amount of the settlement fund of \n$3,000,000.00 (Three Million Dollars). \n  A.  Legal Standards \n  An attorney’s fees award in a class action from a common settlement fund is \nauthorized by F.R. Civ. P. 23(h) and Rule 54(d)(2).  “A litigant with a lawyer who \nrecovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is \nentitled to a reasonable attorney’s fee from the fund as a whole.”  Boeing Company v. \nVan Gemert, 444 U.S. 472, 478 (1980).  Class counsel have pursued the Defendants in \nthis case on behalf of the Plaintiff class to assert and recover for the violation of certain \nrights and privileges guaranteed under the United States Constitution and Section 1983 of \nTitle 42 of the United States Code.  It is well established that common fund principles \nmay be applied when actions instituted under statutes containing fee-shifting provisions \nare resolved by settlement.  See In Re:  Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Anti-\nTrust Litigation, 216 F.R.D. 197, 216 (D. Me. 2003).  It is also well established that the \ncommon fund doctrine is founded on the equitable principle that those who have profited \nfrom the litigation should share in its cost.  See In Re:  Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of \nThe San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 56 Fed.3d 295, 305 N.6 (1st Cir. 1995).   \n  In this case class counsel ask the Court to apply the percentage of fund method to \ncalculate reasonable attorney’s fees in this case.  The percentage of fund method is the \nmethod preferred in this District and in this Circuit.  See In Re:  Compact Disc and San \n7 \n\nJuan Dupont Plaza Hotel, supra.  See also the Settlement Agreement between the parties \ndated September 29, 2006.  (Docket Item No.:  366).   \n  In that agreement:  “The parties … agree[d] to settle this case in exchange for \nDefendants establishing a common fund of  Three Million Dollard ($3,000,000.00), said \namount to include all attorney’s fees and costs incurred, as well as all claims \nadministration expenses.  The parties agree that counsel for Plaintiff will seek to recover \n30% of this fund to cover their fees and costs.” \n  “Plaintiffs’ counsel is certainly free to ask for 30% of the common fund for its \nown attorney’s fee and costs and separately seek to have the claims administration fees \npaid from the fund.  The Court indicated that the ultimate decision on fees and expenses \nwould be made by Judge Carter.”  See Docket Item No. 333. \n  Another approach is the Loadstar method, which multiplies the number of hours \nthe attorneys have expended by their hourly rates to create a “Loadstar” figure.  Class \ncounsel does not request a Loadstar calculation because (1) the First Circuit uses the \npercentage of fund method; and (2) fair application of the Loadstar method would result \nin an attorney’s fee award which would take a significantly larger bite out of the common \nfund and thus dilute the individual shares each class member can be expected to receive \nunder the percentage of fund calculation advocated.   \n  Federal Courts have increased hourly rates (“Loadstar Fees”) by multiples of three \nor four (or more) to account for considerations such as the risk undertaken, the quality of \nthe services rendered, the results achieved, and the delay in receipt of payment.  See, for \n8 \n\nexample, In Re: Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litigation, 146 Fed. Supp. 706, 736 N. 44 (E. \nD. Pa. 2001) (Finding “a Loadstar multiple in the range of 4.5 to 8.5” to be \n“unquestionably reasonable”);  Vranken v. Altantic Richfield Company, 901 Fed. Supp. \n294, 298-299 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (applying a multiple of 3.6 and noting that “multiples in \nthe 3-4 range are common in Loadstar awards for lengthy and complex class action \nlitigation”); Beahrens v. Wometco Enterprises, Inc., 118 F.R.D. 534, 549 (S.D. Fla. \n1988), Aff’d. 899 Fed.2d 21 (11th Cir. 1990) (“The range of Loadstar multiples in large \nand complicated class actions runs from a low of 2.26 to a high of 4.5”).  This Court has \nendorsed the Loadstar multiplier concept, see In Re: Compact Disc, 216 F.R.D. at 216, as \nhas the First Circuit. See Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekossa Corp., 925 Fed.2d 518, \n529 (1st Cir. 1991) (“[T]he Loadstar calculation … will be subject to possible \nenhancement … by the Court if it determines that a multiplier … should be applied.”).  \nThe fee requested here by contrast, is less than class counsel’s actual Loadstar figure.   \n  Class counsel submits that the hours expended on this case, while substantial, are \nentirely reasonable and reflect the challenging nature of the lawsuit and the unwaivering \ncommitment to achieving a successful result .  Every reasonable effort was made to avoid \nunnecessary duplication or repetition of task, and where appropriate, work was assigned \nto paralegals.3  Given the complexity of the claims and defenses, the real risk of non-\n                                                 \n3 Paralegal time is included in the Loadstar calculation at market billing rates and should be adjusted using the risk \nmultiplier, since such time is subject to the same contingent risk as attorney time.   See  Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 \nU.S. 274, 287 (1989) “[I]f a prevailing practice in a given community were to bill paralegal time separately at \nmarket rates, fees awarded the attorney at market rates for attorney time would not be fully compensatory if the \nCourt refused to compensate hours billed by paralegals and did so only at ‘cost’”.  Sula v. National R. Passenger \nCorp, 128 F.R.D. 210, 216 (E.D. PA 1989). \n9 \n\nrecovery, a substantial delay in receipt of payment, the exceptional result achieved and \nthe experience and skill of class counsel, class counsel submit that a fee of $900,000.00 is \n(30% of the gross common fund) fair and reasonable compensation for their work.  If the \nCourt used a Loadstar method and applied a low multiplier such as 2.26 referenced in \nBehrens, supra at 549, It would reverse the economic positions of class counsel and class \nmembers.  Class counsel advocate that the Court preserve $2,000,000.00 (Two Million \nDollars) of the common fund of to pay the class representative incentive award of \n$5,000.00, the 20 class member bonus awards of $500.00 and distribute the remaining \n$1,985,000.00 equally to class members who have filed approved claims.   \n  Class counsel advocates that the Court fashion a reasonable fee and pay class \ncounsels’ litigation expenses and the claims administration fees out of the third million \ndollars of the common fund plus accrued interest on the fund.   \n  There are a number of factors that are generally considered when determining that \na fee award is fair, adequate and reasonable.  Class Counsel have discussed several of \nthose factors in their Motion for Final Settlement Approval, to wit:  reaction of the class; \nstage of litigation, quality of class counsel, conduct of negotiations, and fairness \nadequacy and reasonableness of the notice plan.  Also to be considered are the results \nachieved, the nature and complexity of the litigation; the size of the settlement fund; the \nrisk of non-recovery; and the use of the Loadstar method as a cross check.  And while \nthere are many factors to consider, “… [t]he ultimate goal to be achieved by the \nreviewing Court is to award fees which are adequate to attract competent counsel and yet \n10 \n\nnot so large that they result in a windfall.  Wells v. Dartmouth Bancorp, Inc., 813 Fed. \nSupp. 126, 127-28 (D. New Hampshire, 1993).   \n  Judge Hornby echoes these sentiments in his analysis of the application of the \npercent of fund approach in Nilsen v. York County, _____ F.Supp. ____ Civil No. 02-\n212-P-H, November 10, 2005, at Pages 5 and 6: \nMaking a fair fee award from a common fund in a class action settlement is \na difficult determination for a Judge.  There are no adversarial presentations \nto test the fee claim, and our legal system does not ordinarily expect \nJudge’s to behave as inquisitors, gathering testimony and collecting \ninformation on their own.  Presented with an unopposed request, therefore, \nI depend upon my own analysis and secondary research – against a \nbackdrop of popular dissatisfaction with large and highly publicized fees.  \nThird Circuit Task Force Report, selection of class counsel, 208 F.R.D. \n340, 343-44 (2002) (“2002 Task Force Report”) (“[T]here is a perception \namong a significant part of the non-lawyer population … that class action \nPlaintiffs’ lawyers are overcompensated for the work that they do.”).  But \nthe lawyers here are highly skilled and experienced civil rights attorneys.  \nTheir professional performance was exemplary; they represented the class \nmembers’ interest zealously, achieving an excellent result for the class \nunder the circumstances.  For these reasons they deserve a reasonable fee \nthat duly recognizes their professional excellence and performance and \nprovides an appropriate incentive for lawyers to take on future meritorious \ncases on behalf of the client class.  f.n. 10.  At the same time, they do not \ndeserve a windfall at the expense of the class and I do not want the size of \nthe award to encourage frivolous litigation that benefits primarily lawyers.” \n \n f.n. 10.  “[T]he Court must also be careful to sustain the incentive for \nattorneys to continue to represent such clients on an ‘inescapably \ncontingent’ basis.”  Florin v. Nations Bank of Georgia, (Florin 2), 60 F3d \n1245, 1247 (7th Cir. 1995).   \n \n   B.  Multi-factor Analysis \n  1.  Extraordinary result achieved. \n11 \n\n  Class counsel have achieved a remarkable recovery for class members.  The \ncreation of a settlement fund of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) constitutes an \nextraordinary outcome for the class because each class member (366 in all) stand to \nrecover in excess of $5,000.00 for their “dignity” injuries.  The amount of the Settlement \nFund is also extraordinary given the complicated insurance issues, the complexity of the \ncase and the aggressive defense and attorney time necessary to bring the case to \nconclusion.  Defendants had a combination of self-pay, risk pool and residual coverage.  \nEach dollar that the Defendants consumed in paying their attorneys to defend the case or \nto pay other liability claims against Knox County was one dollar less that the Defendants \nhad available to fund the settlement in this case.  The defense left no stone unturned, no \nissue unexplored and no argument left for later use.  They were steadfast in their denial \nand persistent in their argument.  Every issue that they lost, they raised in reconsideration \nand through their persistence achieved some success in rolling back the scope of custom \nand practice liability on Summary Judgment.  Had the parties gone to trial on individual \ndamages, the economics alone would have been a disaster.  Under the circumstances the \nThree Million Dollar ($3,000,000.00) fund was an extraordinary outcome for the class.   \n  2.  Modest Absolute Size of the Fund \n  Although a typical fee award in a class action settlement is in the neighborhood of \n30%, see In Re: Rite Aid Corp. Securities Litigation, 146 F.Supp. 2nd at 745, this figure \nmasks an unmistakable pattern of fee awards getting smaller (in percentage terms) as \nsettlement amounts get larger.  See In Re:  NASDAQ Market-Makers Anti-Trust \n12 \n\nLitigation, 187 F.R.D. 465 (486 S.D. New York 1998).  See also Nilsen, supra at Pages \n25 to 26. \n  The number of class members benefited here is smaller in comparison to the \nnumber of people benefited in the York County case. There are several explanations for \nthis disparity. First, the parties estimates were that between 400 and 1,500 class members \nwould actually file claims; These estimates were based upon national statistics for class \naction participation and strip search class action participation in particular; Second, the \nclaimants in Nilsen, (about 1,000 class claimants) are said to have received about \n$1,200.00 per person; Third, the newspapers widely published the Department of Health \nand Human Services efforts to capture many of those claims through their Child Support \nEnforcement Unit; Fourth, the desire to remain anonymous both with respect to \nacknowledging an arrest and to avoid exposure of being strip searched; and Fifth, concern \nthat filing a claim and recovering would rile the police and expose the claimant to further \nharassment.  While none of these issues is scientific, many class members have raised \nthem at one or more points in the litigation and during the claims process.  Many scoffed \nat the amount of money that they might receive based on what they had read and heard \nfollowing the York County settlement.  Others were embarrassed that they might be \nexposed and anxious over the thought that there might be some police retribution.   \n  3.  Quality of Representation \n  Class Counsel have over 80 years of combined trial experience in all of the trial \ncourts in the State of Maine and in the Federal Appellate Courts, First Circuit Court of \n13 \n\nAppeals and the United States Supreme Court.  Class Counsel have tried civil and \ncriminal cases, including complex civil matters ranging through Federal Civil Rights, \nemployment law, product liability, financial and medical malpractice.   \n  4.  The complexity and duration of the litigation. \n  This case has been going on for almost five (5) years.  There has been extensive \ndiscovery, extensive Motion practice, and appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals \nwhere the Court affirmed this Court’s class action certification.  The case was also \nprepared for trial and scheduled for trial beginning October 3, 2006.  Had the case not \nsettled on September 29, 2006, counsel would have appeared before the Court on October \n3rd, prepared and ready to try the remaining issues of liability and then to move onto \nindividual issues of damages.  Despite having narrowly defined the issues for trial, there \nwere significant factual disputes as to custom and practice liability as to class members \ndetained at the jail between September, 2002 and December 31, 2004 and as to whether \nsome claimants detained within that time period, were, in fact, strip searched.  \nDecertification of the class added additional complexity to the individualized damages, \nthe nature and scope of the emotional harm caused by the affront to dignity, including \ninappropriate exposure to members of the opposite sex, impermissible touching and strip \nsearch of minors.  Even though the class was certified and the certification affirmed by \nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals in Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), \nKnox County repeatedly challenged the certification and avowed that it would challenge \n14 \n\nthe class certification on future appeals and also challenge the underlying the premises \nthat any individual has a constitutional right of privacy in the jail setting.   \n  5.  Risk of Non-Payment \n  Class Counsel’s fees in this case were totally contingent.  There were substantial \nrisks to non-payment ranging from the County’s inability to pay through its factual and \nlegal challenges to the constitutional claims of the class members. There was also a \nserious risk that a jury would have no sympathy for a person arrested on any charge, no \nmatter how trivial, and strip searched when brought to the jail.  There was also a serious \nrisk that a jury would believe the testimony of corrections officers over the detainees, \nespecially where the detainees frequented the jail.  Even assuming liability, there were \nserious risks that a jury would not award damages to individuals offended by the strip \nsearch but who suffered no physical or economic harm.  Class Counsel devoted more \nthan 5,0004 hours of legal effort over the span of the case and expended more than \n$169,000.00, exclusive of settlement claims administration costs, to prosecute the case \nand to obtain the Three Million Dollar ($3,000,000.00) Settlement Fund. \n  The individual claims of class members could not have been pursued except \nthrough the class action mechanism. The individual claims were too small and the \nindividual parties financial resources too limited to warrant the substantial out-of-pocket \nexpenditures on attorney’s fees and costs to obtain legal representation.  For a contingent \nfee representation to make economic sense for an attorney, the risk of receiving no fee \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs’ Counsel expended more than 4,000 hours over two years in the York County case which is some \nevidence that class counsel here were efficient in their work on behalf of class members expending slightly over \n5,000 hours in more than a four-year period. \n15 \n\nwhatsoever if the litigation is unsuccessful, must be offset by the possibility of earning a \nsufficient fee in the event of a favorable outcome to justify the time, effort and expense \nnecessary to pursue the claim to the end.  Even then, especially in the class action setting, \nthe Court must determine that the award requested is reasonable under the circumstances \nof the case.  Loadstar provides a method of cross checking and even though the Loadstar \ncross check is easy to apply in this case because class counsels’ Loadstar fee exceeds the \npercentage of fund request made by class counsel, application of Loadstar under the \ncircumstances of this case would result in an unfair fee award.   \n  IV.  LITIGATION COSTS \n  Class counsel respectfully requests reimbursement of their litigation costs and \nexpenses in the amount of $178,561.41 ($8,684.33 of this amount represents payment to \nthe Settlement Claims Administrator for claims administration expenses).  A table of \ndisbursements is attached to this Motion as Exhibit B to Class Counsels’ Affidavit filed \nin support of this Motion.  The large amounts expended for experts were especially \ncritical to evaluating the computerized data produced by the Defendants, identifying \npotential claimants, verifying the unconstitutional policies, customs and practices of the \njail, determining the scope of potential damages and verifying the blanket strip search \nbehavior of the guards through individual contact with the class claimants.  While \nexpensive, the database proved invaluable.  Class Counsel continue to use the database to \nverify the validity of claims.  Other significant costs were fees paid to other attorneys to \nbrief the class certification issues on the First Circuit Appeal. Those services were \n16 \n\ninstrumental in gaining the Appellate Court’s affirmation of this Court’s class \ncertification decision.   \n  V.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, class counsel respectfully request that the Court award \nthem $900,000.00 as reasonable attorney’s fees and $178,561.41 in litigation expenses in \nthe prosecution of this litigation and further award sufficient sums to pay the cost of \nsettlement claims administration. \nDated:  March 30, 2007   /s/ Sumner Lipman  \n              Sumner Lipman, Esq. \n              Attorney for Plaintiffs \n              Lipman, Katz & McKee \n              227 Water Street, P.O.

Stolt, first being duly sworn, do hereby depose and say: \n  1.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this Affidavit.  I am a \nmember of the law firm of Lipman, Katz & McKee, P.A. and co-class counsel with \nSumner H. Lipman, Esq. of my firm and Dale F. Thistle, Esq., Law Office Dale F. \nThistle, in the above-captioned class action.   \n  2.  I make this Affidavit in support of Class Counsel’s Motion for Award of \nAttorney’s Fees, Cost of Litigation and Expenses of Settlement of Administration.  The \ntime expended in preparing the Motion and this Affidavit is not included.   \n\n  3.  Class Counsels’ compensation for the services rendered is fully contingent.  \nAny fees and reimbursement expenses will be limited to such amounts as may be \nawarded by the Court.  The original class representative agreed to a fee not to exceed \n40% of the gross recovery. \n  4.  During the period from the inception of the case on September 4, 2002 \nthrough February 26, 2007, class counsel performed 5,237.2 hours of work in connection \nwith the prosecution of this class action.  Based upon hourly rates charged in similar \nmatters, the Loadstar value of the time is $936,236.00.

SUMMARY  \n \n  The parties agreed to settle this case on Friday, September 29, 2006 at the Judicial \nSettlement Conference with Chief Judge Singal. (Docket Item No. 328). The general \nterms of the agreement are set forth in a Settlement Agreement signed by all parties on \nSeptember 29, 2006.  Additionally, the Court will issue an injunctive Order designed to \nprevent unconstitutional strip searches in the future.  Under the Settlement Agreement, \nthe parties are required to submit, using the Second Amended Settlement Agreement \napproved in Nilsen v. York County, (02-CV-212-P-H) their final written agreement, along \nwith a Motion to Recertify the Class on or before Tuesday, October 3, 2006.  (Docket \nItem No. 318, supra). \n  Pursuant to the Court’s October 4, 2006 “Remark” (Docket Item No. 334), the \n \n1 \n\n \nparties will either jointly agree on language to be included in the injunctive Order, or will \nseparately submit proposed orders to the Court. \nThe Agreement also settles all claims of the class, including, without limitation on \nthe generality of the foregoing, claims of the class representatives and absent class \nmembers who have not opted out for compensatory damages, punitive damages, \nattorneys fees and costs, and interest by establishing a common fund of Three Million \nDollars ($3,000,000.00), to be shared among participating class members after payment \nof attorneys fees, costs, claims administration expenses, and class representative bonuses.  \nUnder this Agreement, class members will receive one payment regardless of the number \nof times that they were booked into the jail and searched during the class period.   \nII.  TERMS\nA.  Procedural History\n  1.  Plaintiff filed this action on or about November 19, 2002.  On November 5, \n2003, Judge Gene Carter of the United States District Court for the District of Maine \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification and certified this case as a class action \nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as follows: \nAll people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search \nand/or  visual  body  cavity  search  without  evaluation  for  individualized \nreasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox County Jail: \n \n(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a \nviolent felony; or \n \n(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon, \n \n2 \n\n \ndrugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involved a \nweapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or \n \n(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or \na violent felony. \n \nThe decision to certify the class was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. \n  2.  Plaintiffs alleged that all arrestees or pre-trial detainees at the Knox County Jail \nwere subjected to a strip search, sometimes to include a visual body cavity search, as part \nof  the  booking  procedure.    The  Defendants  have  denied  those  allegations  and  have \nasserted that both their officially promulgated policies and their actual practices and \nprocedures were at all times consistent with constitutional requirements.   \nB.  Agreement \n  1.  The parties agree that the class period begins on November 19, 1996, and ends \nDecember 31, 2004.   \n  2.  The Parties understand that the Court will issue an injunction the purpose of \nwhich  will  be  to  ensure the  Defendants’  compliance  with Fourth  Amendment law \ngoverning strip searches.  The parties have agreed on the terms of the injunction which \nare set forth in a proposed injunctive Order attached as Exhibit G.  If the Court issues the \ninjunctive Order as proposed by the parties, all parties waive their rights to appeal this \ninjunctive Order.  In the event that the Court issues an injunctive Order different than that \n \n3 \n\n \nproposed by the parties, the parties expressly reserve the right to appeal the injunctive \nOrder and the Settlement Agreement of which it is an integral part to the U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit.. \n  3.  An approved class action notice was sent to potential class members at their \nlast known addresses and notices were published as required by the Court after class \ncertification. No class members asked to be excluded by the opt out deadline.   \n  4.  The Defendants will pay Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) to settle all \nclaims brought by Plaintiff and class in this action including claims for attorneys’ fees, \ncosts, administrative costs, and interest by check made out to the “Knox Settlement \nFund” and delivered to class counsel no later than January 15, 2007. \n5.  The parties agree and acknowledge that the Defendants have denied liability in \nwhole and that the payment was made and other agreements contained herein were given \nwithout admission of liability, which is expressly denied, and which payment was made \nand other agreements were given by the Defendants solely for the purpose of buying their \npeace and freedom from litigation.  No language contained in this Settlement Agreement \nor any language contained in any motions for approval of settlement filed by Plaintiffs or \nin any orders by the Court approving or denying either preliminary or final approval to \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  shall  in  any  way  be  construed  as  acknowledgments  or \nadmissions of liability, all of which are expressly denied by the Defendants. \n  6.  The Defendants and their counsel agree to provide reasonable assistance to \nfacilitate the administration of this settlement including providing access to data and \n  4 \n\n \ndocuments necessary to determine class membership if a person disputes denial of a \nclaim by the claims administrator. \n  7.  The Defendants understand that this agreement will require approval of the \nCourt.  The Defendants will ask the Court to approve the terms of the settlement. \n  8.  If Plaintiff has to incur any additional attorney time or costs to seek collection \nof the settlement fund because of a default by the Defendants in the timely performance \nof its obligations to pay under this Agreement, the Defendants may be responsible for \npayment of reasonable attorneys fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Any request for \nsuch additional fees and costs shall be by application to the Court with opportunity for \nobjection by the Defendants. \n  9.    Class  counsel  will  establish  the  “Knox  Settlement  Fund”  as  a  qualified \nsettlement fund.  Once the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the entire fund \nand all interest or income resulting from the investment of the fund shall be part of the \nfund.  If the Defendants do not pay all or part of their obligation on time, the amount \nowed by that Defendant will accrue interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year, \ncompounded daily.  Interest will only apply to the unpaid portion of the Defendant’s \nobligation. \n  10.  The Settlement Fund and any money earned by the fund will be invested in \nthe  Marshall  Money  Market  fund  which  is  AAA  rated  by  Fitch,  unless  and  until \notherwise ordered by the Court.  Class Counsel, Class Representatives, Defendants and \nDefense Counsel shall not have any responsibility or liability for the investment of the \n  5 \n\n \nSettlement Fund.  If the Court does not give final approval to the settlement, the Plaintiffs \nwill return the amount paid to the Defendants. \nIII.  COURT SUPERVISION\n  1.  The Court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and may enter orders as \nappropriate to enforce it, to adjudicate the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and to \neffect fair and orderly administration. \n  2.  Any deadlines, dates, or other details in this Settlement Agreement may be \nchanged by the Court on a showing of good cause. \nIV.  HEARING\n  1.  The Court will schedule a hearing to decide whether to grant approval to the \nsettlement, recertify the class for settlement purposes and to issue a permanent Injunctive \nOrder.  If approval is granted, the parties will begin to implement the settlement.  The \nDefendants will make their payment as specified hereinabove, and the Plaintiffs will send \nthe approved notice to the class.   \n  2.  The Court will hold a final fairness hearing to decide whether to grant final \napproval of settlement on April 2, 2007.   \n  3.  If the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the Knox Settlement Fund \nwill belong to the Plaintiff and the class, and the Defendants will no longer have any right \nto, title to, or interest in the funds.  The funds will then be distributed pursuant to orders \nof the Court. \n  6 \n\n \nV.  CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR\n  1. Class counsel requests that the firm of Analytics, Inc. of Chanhassen, Minnesota \nto  be  approved  by  the  Court  as  Claims  Administrator.    The  Declaration  of  Richard \nSimmons and the qualifications of Analytics, Inc. are attached hereto as Exhibit E. \n  2.    Class  counsel  recommends  that  the  Claims  Administrator  be  permitted  to \ndesignate an attorney as agent in Knox County to distribute checks to any claimants who \nwish to pick up their check.  This agent will be paid by the Claims Administrator for \nperforming this service. \n  3.    The  Claims  Administrator  will  administer  notice  to  class  members  in  the \nmanner prescribed by the Court; shall accept and docket all claims; shall send all notices \nthat a claim has been accepted or rejected to class members; shall resolve any appeals of \nclaim denials; shall calculate the amount of each claim pursuant to the formula set out in \nthis Agreement; and shall report to the Court as necessary, including providing a final \nreport. \n  4.  Class counsel will oversee settlement administration and will provide direction \nto the Claims Administrator as needed. \nVI.  NOTICE, OBJECTIONS, AND CLAIM\n  1.  Class counsel will send a Notice of Class Action Settlement and of the Hearing \nto Approve the Settlement (“Notice of Settlement”), a Settlement Claim Form, and a \nFrequently Asked Questions sheet, by first class mail postage prepaid to all potential \nclass members, whose addresses are known to class counsel, at their last known address \n  7 \n\n \nwithin three weeks after the Court’s order granting preliminary approval.  If any mail is \nreturned by the post office with notice of a more current address, class counsel will \nresend the notice to that address.  Class counsel is not required to make any further \nefforts to send mail directly to class members.  A Notice of Settlement and Settlement \nClaim Form will be made available to anyone who requests such information.  Claim \nForms will be available to be downloaded from the web site or on request to the Claims \nAdministrator including through a toll free number. \n  2.  The Notice of Settlement will include the terms of the settlement (attached as \nExhibit A) and the class member’s right to contest the settlement.  This Notice includes \nFrequently Asked Questions which explain the settlement terms and answer anticipated \nquestions.  Attached as Exhibit F is the envelope to be used for mailing the proposed \nNotice of Settlement.   \n  3.  The Settlement Claim Form requests the class member’s contact information, \naffirmation that he or she meets the class definition, instructions for check delivery, and a \nForm W-9.  The proposed settlement claim form is attached as Exhibit B. \n  4.  Class counsel will also publish notice of the settlement in the Portland Press \nHerald, Rockland Courier Gazette and the Bangor Daily News.  This notice is attached as \nExhibit C.  The Defendant agrees to post the notice for publication attached as Exhibit C \nin the intake/booking area as well as in one area frequented by inmates in each of the \nseparate pods at the jail.  The notices will be posted as soon as the Court approves the \nmailing of a class wide notice of proposed settlement attached as Exhibit A, and will \n  8 \n\n \nremain up until the last day that the settlement claim forms can be filed.  In addition, the \nDefendant has agreed to make available during the same timeframe defined in the prior \nsentence,  to  inmates  (or  anyone  else)  who  requests  it,  a  copy  of  the  Notice  of  the \nSettlement attached as Exhibit A and counsel for the class will provide the County with \n500 copies.   \n  5.    In  addition  to  the  legal  notices,  class  counsel  will  issue  a  press  release \ninforming the public of the settlement.  The press release is attached as Exhibit D. \n  6.    Class  counsel,  through  the  Claims  Administrator,  will  establish  a  website \n(www.knoxcountyjailclass.com) which will include the Notice of Settlement (Exhibit A) \nand the Settlement Claim Form (Exhibit B).   \n  7.  The Claims Administrator will send a claim form to anyone who requests one \nbefore the time for filing claim forms has expired.  In addition, the Claims Administrator \nwill maintain updated documents regarding this settlement on the website including a \nclaim  form  which  can  be  printed  and  mailed.  The  Claims  Administrator  will  also \nestablish,  within  three  weeks  after  the  Court  grants  preliminary  approval  of  this \nsettlement, and maintain a toll-free number for claimants to call with questions about the \nclaim form. This number will be operational for at least five (5) months. \n  8.  In order for a class member to claim a share of the settlement, he or she must \nsubmit a valid and complete Settlement Claim Form postmarked no later than  January 5, \n2007.  This deadline is called the “Claims Deadline”. \n  9.  In order for a class member to object to the proposed settlement, he or she must \n  9 \n\n \nsubmit written notice of the objection to the Claims Administrator.  In addition, an \nobjector may also appear in person or through counsel at the final fairness hearing when \nthe objection will be considered by the Court.  The Claims Administrator will forward all \nletters of objection to the Court and to counsel for all parties.  (The class member must \nalso submit a Settlement Claim Form if he or she wishes to be eligible to share in the \nsettlement should it be approved despite his or her objection.) \n  10.  Settlement Claim Forms received by the Claims Administrator within two \nweeks after the Claims Deadline will be treated as if postmarked by the Claims Deadline.  \nThis two-week grace is the Amnesty Period. \n  11.  Notwithstanding paragraph 10 above, claim forms will be treated as filed in a \ntimely manner if either (1) the form is received by the Claims Administrator by no later \nthan January 5, 2007, or (2) if a request to permit additional time to file a claim form is \nreceived by the Court by no later than January 5, 2007 and the related claim form is \nreceived by the Claims Administrator by no later than January 19, 2007. Claim forms \nreceived after this date will be denied as untimely. \nVII.  APPROVALS AND APPEALS\n  1.  The Claims Administrator will review each claim form to determine that the \nclaimant is a class member by confirming (a) that the Settlement Claim Form is timely \nand valid, (b) that the information on the form is consistent with available booking data \npreviously provided by the Defendants, and (c) that the Form is completely filled out and \nsigned.   \n  10 \n\n \n  2.  The Claims Administrator may, in its discretion, waive a technical defect in the \nClaim Form to achieve substantial justice. \n  3.  If the booking data indicates that the person does not meet the class definition, \nthe Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant.  The denial \nnotice will indicate the reason or reasons for the denial.  These would include (a) not at \nthe jail during the class period, (b) no booking for an offense within the class definition, \nor (c) that the person was not strip searched while being held awaiting bail or a first court \nappearance.  Because the booking data is sometimes inaccurate or non-descriptive as to \nwhether a person was strip searched, the Claims Administrator may accept the Claimant’s \naffirmation of strip search.   \n  4.  In order to object to the Claims Administrator’s determination that he or she is \nnot  a  class  member,  a  claimant  must  file  a  written  notice  of  appeal  to  the  Claims \nAdministrator postmarked no later than two (2) weeks after the date of the mailing on the \nNotice of Claim Denial.  He or she may include written documentation that shows that he \nor she is a class member, and he or she may also include a written statement.  Those \nobjections  claiming  that  a  person  who  otherwise  met  the  class  definition  was  strip \nsearched will be reviewed against available records of the Defendants to determine if the \nperson was strip searched.  The Claims Administrator will make a determination on each \nappeal no later than eight (8) weeks after the deadline for class members to file such \nappeals.  The Claims Administrator will inform the class member in writing of their \ndetermination  and  will  provide  copies  to  all  counsel.    Rulings  by  the  Claims \n  11 \n\n \nAdministrator will be final and binding, except that a Claimant is allowed to appeal a \ndenial of a claim directly to the Court. \n  5.  The Claims Administrator will send a Notice of Claim Approval (“Notice of \nClaim Approval”) to each approved claimant promptly but in no event later than one \nweek after the Court grants final approval of the settlement.   \n  6.  A claimant who used a different name at booking must present documentation \nestablishing that he or she is the person referred to in the booking records.  \nVIII.  EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS FEES\n  1.  Administrative costs, including the Claims Administrator’s fees and expenses, \nwill be paid from the Settlement Fund.   \n  2.  Class counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of Plaintiff’s attorneys \nfees and out-of-pocket costs in the amount of thirty percent (30%) of the settlement fund.  \nThese fees and costs shall be paid at the same time as the distribution of the Settlement \nFund to class members.  In addition, class counsel will ask the Court to deduct from the \nsettlement an amount sufficient to pay the costs of further litigation and the expenses of \nclaims administration.  The parties understand that the Court shall have the discretion to \naward whatever fees and costs it deems justified based upon the submissions by the class \ncounsel in support of those fees and costs.   \nIX.  DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS\n  1.  Class counsel recommends to the Court that the Claims Administrator pay \nbonuses from the Settlement Fund to compensate the class representative for the time that \n  12 \n\n \nshe  spent  on  this  case  and  her  loss  of  privacy  as  a  result  of  serving  as  a  Class \nRepresentative.  Class counsel also recommends a bonus to compensate the 19 class \nmembers whose depositions were taken by defense counsel for the time they spent.  Class \ncounsel recommends a bonus of $5,000.00 to the class representative of record as of the \ndate of the final approval of this settlement.  Class counsel recommends a bonus of \n$500.00 to each of the 19 class members who were deposed by the Defendants.  These \nchecks will be issued at the same time as payments to class members. \n  2.  Class members will receive payment from the common fund after deducting \nattorneys fees, costs, expenses of administration, and bonuses to the class representative \nand those class members who were deposed by the Defendants. \n  3.  The Claims Administrator will calculate the amount of money due each class \nmember by providing one share for every class member with an approved claim.  The \nClaims  Administrator  will  total  the  number  of  approved  shares  and  then  divide  the \namount  remaining  in  the  Settlement  Fund  (after  the  payments  made  as  provided  in \nParagraph 2 above) by the number of shares to determine the amount each approved \nparticipating class member will receive. \n  4.  Class members will receive one payment even if they were booked into the jail \nand strip searched more than one time during the class period. \n  5.  Each class member’s check will be made payable only in his or her name or, \nupon the death of a class member, to the personal representative of the deceased class \nmember’s estate or the person filing an affidavit in compliance with the Maine Procedure \n  13 \n\n \nfor  Collection  of  Personal  Property  by  Affidavit  of  the  Rightful  Heir  under  18-A \nM.R.S.A. § 3-1201, or the equivalent procedure of the law of another state that governs \nthe estate of the deceased class member.  A check will be mailed to the class member at \ntheir mailing address or it may be picked up.  Any change of address request must be \nmade in writing and must be signed by the claimant. \n  6.    If  a  participating  class  member  is  confined  in  a  prison,  hospital  or  other \ninstitution and has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement \ncheck  will  be  sent  to  that  address  unless  the  class  member  makes  other  acceptable \narrangements in writing with the Claims Administrator. \nX.  POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION\n  1. Marshall and Ilsley Bank, a nationally chartered bank, will prepare all Forms \n1099 for class members who receive a settlement check during the bank’s next regular \ntax-form processing following distribution.  The Claims Administrator will prepare all \nother necessary tax forms relating to the Settlement Fund account. \n  2.  The Claims Administrator will provide a report to the Court and to counsel for \nall parties accounting for the distribution of settlement funds, including attorneys fees and \nexpenses, once the distribution is complete. \n  3.    Any  balance  in  the  settlement  fund  after  all  settlement  checks  have  been \ndistributed and all bonuses, expenses, and attorneys fees have been paid and will be \ndistributed under the Cy Pres  doctrine on order of the Court.  The parties understand that \nthe  Court  shall  have  the  discretion  to  order  Cy  Pres  distribution  based  upon  the \n  14 \n\n \nsubmissions by the class counsel in support of such distribution. \nXI.  DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS\n  1.    If  a  class  member  is  deceased,  an  authorized  representative  may  file  a \nSettlement  Claim  Form  on  behalf  of  the  estate  within  the  Claims  Deadline,  i.e. \npostmarked no later than  January 5, 2007.  However, the representative must provide to \nthe Claims Administrator within the Claims Deadline documentation that an estate has \nbeen established in accordance with the law and with Paragraph IX (5), above. \nXII.  RELEASE AND AGREEMENT TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD \nHARMLESS\n \n  1.

The parties have expressly agreed that the release of claims arising from the \nsettlement includes all visual inspections, including without limitation visual body cavity \ninspections, that otherwise fall within the scope of the claims certified as a class action by \nthe Court in this case.  The parties further agree that this release of claims applies to any \nclaims that the strip searches were conducted in a manner that was unlawful, including \nwithout limitation, claims of physical touching, cross-gender searches, or searches which \n  15 \n\n \nwere observed by persons other than the correctional officer performing the search. The \nparties further agree that their settlement does not release any other claims, such as \nwrongful arrest, excessive force, or searches that were not part of the admission process \n(such as strip searches after a lockdown).   \n  2.    In  further  consideration  of  payment  of  the  settlement  amount,  each  class \nmember shall be obligated to satisfy all liens, subrogation interests or claims of any \ndoctor, hospital, insurance carrier, state or governmental agency, or any other person, \nfirm, or corporation, which have been made or may in the future be made against the \npayment to that class member described herein, or against any Defendant, arising out of \nthe claims, demands, actions or causes of action set forth in the First Amended Complaint \nand released as part of this Settlement Agreement.  Each class member further agrees to \nhold harmless and to defend and indemnify the Defendants, including their officers, \nofficials, employees, attorneys, agents, or any of them, to the fullest extent possible, from \nand  for  any  claims,  demands,  actions,  causes  of  action,  suits,  judgments,  costs  or \nexpenses of any kind, brought by that class member as a result of any search within the \nscope of this class action as certified by the Court in any orders approving this Settlement \nAgreement, whether or not the class member actually made a claim, except any class \nmember who opted out of the settlement. \nXIII.

Knox County Civil Action No. 02-251-PH \n \nYou could get a payment from a $3 million dollar class \naction settlement if you meet all of the following conditions: \n \n  1.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December \n31, 2004 \n \n  2.  You were held at the Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first \ncourt appearance.  This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n \n  3.  You were not charged with a crime involving drugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \n  4.  You were strip searched without evaluation to determine if there was a reason to  \n    Suspect possession of hidden contraband. \n \nA federal Court authorized this notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \n•  A $3 million settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about alleged illegal strip \nsearches that took place when people were strip searched at the Knox County Jail while \nbeing held prior to trial. \n \n•  The settlement fund will pay cash to those who submit valid claims after deducting attorney’s \nfees, and the costs and expenses for this case. \n \n•  The settlement prohibits the Knox County Jail from continuing the policy, custom and \npractice of strip searching people held prior to trial, charged with crimes not involving drugs, \nweapons or a violent felony. \n \n  Your legal rights are affected if you act or do not act. Please Read this Notice Carefully \n \nYou are receiving this notice because records show that you may be a class member. To see if you \nqualify, you must submit a complete Settlement Claim Form, postmarked by January 5, 2007, to:  \n                 \n    Tardiff Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2006, Chanhassen, MN 55317-2006 \n \nIf you submit a claim form and qualify as a class member, you will share in this settlement. The amount \nof money you will receive depends on how many people submit claim forms. The money will be divided \nby the number of claims. Lawyers for the plaintiffs believe that over seven thousand people are eligible \nmembers of the Class.  \n \n \nTHESE ARE YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT:  \nSubmit a Claim Form   This is the only way to get a payment. Remember: Claim Forms \npostmarked after January 5, 2007 will not be considered for payment. \nQuestions?

Second, you must appear in Court at the Fairness \nHearing on April 2, 2007.  Third, you must also submit a claim form. \nDo Nothing  You get no payment. You will still be bound by the settlement and you give \nup your right to sue the defendant on these claims later. \n \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS – WHAT YOU GET AND HOW TO GET IT \n \nHow much will my payment be? \n \nWe do not know the amount of the payments. If you are eligible you will get a payment for only one \nstrip search. The amount will depend on how many people submit claim forms.  The amount per person \nwill decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. Each participating person will receive an \nequal amount. \n \nThe settlement money will be distributed after payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses and bonuses. \nCounsel requests a 30% attorney’s fee, which includes all costs, expenses and disbursements.  Class \ncounsel requests payment of a bonus to the class representative and class members who were deposed to \ncompensate them for the time they spent helping to bring about this settlement and for the loss of \nprivacy to the class representative. The requested bonuses range from $500.00 for participating in a \ndeposition to $50,000.00 for serving as class representative. The total amount of the requested bonuses \nis $59,500.00, less than 2% of the total settlement. \n \nHow can I get a payment? \n \nYou must fill out the Settlement Claim Form completely and mail it to the Claims Administrator. A \nClaim Form is included with this notice. You can also obtain a Claim Form from the Settlement Website \nat www.knoxcountyjailclass.com.

The Court \nwill hold a hearing on April 2, 2007, to decide whether to approve the settlement.  If the Court approves \nthe settlement and all appeals are completed promptly, you should receive your settlement check by June \n1, 2007, unless there are any unforeseen delays.  \n \nWill I have to pay taxes on my payment? \n \nYou may have to pay taxes on your payment. You should consult your tax preparer when you file your \ntax returns. The Claims Administrator will send you a 1099 Form.

If you do not send in a claim form you \nwill not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment. You will also be barred \nfrom filing a case on these claims in the future. \n \nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT \n \nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\n \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Laurie Tardiff), sued on \nbehalf of all people who have similar claims.  All of the people who were similarly treated are known as \nthe Class or Class Members.  One court resolves the issues for all Class Members.   \n \nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the settlement?\n \nThe Court has ruled that you are a Class Member if you meet all four factors below: \n \n1.   You were held at the Knox County Jail after November 19, 1996 and before December 31, 2004. \n2.   You were held at Knox County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or first court \nappearance. This includes arrests on default and other warrants. \n3.   You were not charged with a crime involving drugs or weapons or a violent felony. \n4.   You were strip searched before a first court appearance or while awaiting bail. \n \nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip searched while you were serving a \nsentence, (2) you were strip searched after an evaluation which determined there was reason to suspect \npossession of hidden contraband., or (3) you were arrested for and/or charged with a crime involving \ndrugs, weapons or a violent felony. \n \nWhat crimes are considered to be violent felonies?\n \nThe following crimes are violent felonies: aggravated assault, arson, assault on an officer, criminal \nrestraint, elevated aggravated assault, gross sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, murder, rape, and \nrobbery. This list is non-exclusive, and other felony level crimes may be determined to be “violent”. \n \nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime? \n \nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership. If any one of the charges \nwas a crime involving weapons or drugs or was a violent felony, you are not a class member for that \narrest. You might be eligible for another arrest. \n \nWhat if I was arrested on a default warrant of violation of probation or parole? \n   \nYou are a class member if you were arrested on a default or other warrant or for violating the terms of \nprobation or parole so long as the crime for which you were on probation did not involve weapons, or \ndrugs, or a violent felony. \n3\nQuestions?

The booking records kept by the Knox County Jail will help determine if you are a class \nmember. You can help by listing the date or dates when you feel you met the class definition.  If the \nrecords do not show that you fit the class definition, your claim will be denied. You can appeal your \ndenial to the claims administrator by sending documentation and information regarding the dates you \nbelieve you were held and strip searched.  A decision by the Claims Administrator can be appealed to \nthe Judge.  (If you are not a class member, you are not bound by this settlement. You can take action as \nan individual if you wish.) \n \nWhat if I was arrested and strip searched more than once, can I still participate? \n \nYes. If you were arrested and brought to the Jail more than once during the class period you are a \nmember of the class and can recover money. You can only recover one payment, however, as you will \nnot be provided with extra payments if you were arrested and strip searched at the jail more than one \ntime. \n \nWhat if I was at the jail on or before November 18, 1996 or after December 31, 2004?\n \nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be filed \nwithin a certain time period; this is called the statute of limitations.  The law in Maine only allows a \nperson to bring a claim within six years after his or her rights were violated.  Because this case was filed \nby Laurie Tardiff on or about November 19, 2002, class members include anyone strip-searched in the \nsix years before that date.  If you were strip-searched on or before November 18, 1996, it may be too \nlate to bring a lawsuit.  The time period for the class ends on December 31, 2004. If you were strip-\nsearched after this date, that search is not a part of this lawsuit; you must file your own lawsuit.  \n \nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\n \nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime. \n \nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the settlement? \n \nIf you are still unsure as to whether you are a member of the class, you may fill out and return the \nSettlement Claim Form.  If the settlement is approved, you will be notified if you do not qualify. If you \nqualify you will receive a check.  You may also visit the settlement website on the Internet at \nwww.knoxcountyjailclass.com or call (877) 797-5732 to speak to a Settlement Administrator or Class \nCounsel to answer your questions.  \n \nHow did the lawyers in this case find me and how can I protect my privacy? \n \nAfter you were arrested, you gave your name and address at the Knox County Jail during booking.  This \ninformation was given to the lawyers for the plaintiffs by Knox County pursuant to a court order. The \nlawyers for the plaintiffs will do everything they can to protect your privacy.  Only the lawyers in the \ncase and the Court appointed Claims Administrator will know your name and, in most cases, only the \nClaims Administrator will see your Claim Form.  \n \n4\nQuestions?

The Court will consider \nwhether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. The Court will also decide whether to approve \nthe request for attorney’s fees, costs, expenses and the bonuses to class representatives. If the Court \napproves the proposed settlement, it will affect all class members.      \n \nWhen and where is the hearing? \n \nThe Hearing will be at tba a.m./p.m. on day, April 2, 2007 in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 \nFederal Street, Portland, ME.  \n \nDo I have to come to the hearing? \n \nClass counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. You are welcome to come at your own \nexpense. If you object to the settlement and you want to explain the objection to the Court you can \nattend the hearing or hire your own lawyer to attend for you.     \n \nMay I or my lawyer speak at the hearing? \n \nYes, but only if you or your lawyer filed a written objection before the hearing. \n \nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT   \n \nWhat if I think the proposed settlement is not fair? What can I do? \n \nIf you wish to object to the proposed settlement, you must state your objections to the Court in a letter \nsent to the Tardiff Settlement Claims Administrator, postmarked by January 19, 2007.  The Claims \nAdministrator will forward your objection to the Court and to the lawyers for the plaintiffs and for Knox \nCounty. If you want to explain the written objection to the court you, or a lawyer on your behalf, can \nappear in the U.S. District Court of Maine, 156 Federal Street, Portland, ME on April 2, 2007 to present \nyour objections. \n \nYou may object to the proposed settlement and still be eligible to receive a payment.  You must submit \na valid Settlement Claim Form even if you object to the settlement, if you wish to claim money should \nthe settlement be approved. \n \nTHE LAWYERS IN THIS CASE \n \nWho are the lawyers in this case? \n \nThe lawyers for the plaintiffs are Robert Stolt, Esq., and Sumner Lipman, Esq., Lipman, Katz & McKee, \n227 Water Street, P.O.
