    "summary": "<p>On January 20, 2006, a prisoner of the State of Florida filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Florida Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the District of Northern Florida.  The plaintiff, who was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection, asked the court to enjoin the defendants from carrying out the execution, arguing that the lethal injection procedure inflicts unnecessary pain and torture in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  </p><p>On January 21, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida (Judge Stephan P. Mickle) dismissed the plaintiff's complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that since the plaintiff's motion raised no issues of newly-discovered evidence, it was the functional equivalent of a successive petition for writ of habeas corpus.  The plaintiff appealed.  On January 24, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the plaintiff's application for a stay of execution and expedited appeal.  The plaintiff asked for review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  </p><p>\t</p><p>On June 12, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a slip opinion in which it reversed and remanded the case back to the Eleventh Circuit, holding that the plaintiff's claim could be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and did not have to be brought as a habeas claim since he was only challenging the method of injection instead of challenging lethal injection as a general matter.  On August 29, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case back to the District Court.  Hill v. McDonough, 462 F.3d 1313 (11th Cir. 2006).  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case, and on September 1, 2006, the District Court (Judge Mickle) granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiff was bringing the case only to unnecessarily delay the execution.  </p><p>The plaintiff filed a motion for consideration, which the District Court (Judge Mickle) denied on September 11, 2006, holding that the plaintiff was merely trying to delay final judgment.  The plaintiff asked the Eleventh Circuit to issue a stay of execution order, and on September 15, 2006, the court declined to issue the order in a per curiam opinion.  The plaintiff asked for review by the Supreme Court, and on September 20, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari in the case.  Hill v. McDonough, No. 06-0301, 165 L.Ed. 1013 (2006).</p><p>After serving more than 23 years on Florida's Death Row, Clarence Edward Hill was executed on September 20, 2006 by lethal injection.</p><p></p>",

Jan. 24, 2006).\nJURISDICTION\nPetitioner  invokes  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  to review  the\ndenial  of  Hill’s  42  U.S.C.  §1983  action  in  this  capital  case\npresently  set for execution  January  24, 2006 at 6:00 P.M.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL  AND\nSTATUTORY  PROVISIONS  INVOLVED\nRespondent  accepts  the constitutional  provisions  involved.\nSTATEMENT  OF THE CASE\n(i) Course  of Proceedinq~  and Disposition  in the Court  Below\nClarence  Hill  and  his  accomplice,  Cliff  Jackson,  robbed  a\nSavings  and Loan Association  in Pensacola,  Florida,  on October  19,\n1982.  In Hill’s  attempt  to escape  and  prevent  the  immediate\napprehension  of his co-defendant,  Hill  stealthily  approached  the\npolice  officers  attempting  to handcuff  Jackson,  drew  his gun and\nshot  both  officers,  killing  one and wounding  the other.  Hill  was\nindicted  on  November  2, 1982,  for  the  first-degree  murder  of\nOfficer  Stephen  Taylor,  attempted  first-degree  murder  of Officer\nLarry  Bailly,  three  counts  of armed  robbery  and  possession  of a\nfirearm  during  the commission  of a felony.  On April 29, 1983,  with\nthe  jury  convicted  Hill  of both  first-degree  murder  and  felony\nmurder  as alleged  in Count  I. Following  sentencing  phase,  the jury\nreturned  a 10-2 death recommendation  and on May 17, 1983, the trial\ncourt  concurred.  The  Florida  Supreme  Court  affirmed  Hill’s\nconvictions,  but reversed  the death  sentence.  Hill  v. State,  477\nSo.2d 553 (Fla. 1985).\nA number  of\nResentencing  occurred  on March  24-27,  1986.\nThe defense\nwitnesses  testified  in behalf  of Hill in mitigation.\n\n!\n/\n/\nI\npresented  five  character  witnesses  besides  Hill’s  parents.\nAdditionally,  Dr. James Larson,  a psychologist  who examined  Hill on\nDecember  22,  1982,  to ascertain  whether  Hill  suffered  from  any\nmental  disability;  whether  there  was  any  need  for  involuntary\nhospitalization  and  for purposes  of discovering  any  evidence  in\nmitigation,  was called.  Dr. Larson  concluded  Hill was  of average\nintelligence  but scored  borderline  retarded  when it came to verbal\nability;  he found  no evidence  of mental  disorder  of psychosis;  he\nreviewed  a plethora  of school and medical  records and found nothing\nin the  records  that  Hill  suffered  from  any  mental  dysfunction.\nFollowing  all of the testimony,  the jury recommendation  death ii-I.\n2\nThe trial  court  determined  death  was the appropriate  sentence.\nThe Florida  Supreme  Court,  on appeal,  affirmed  the reimposition  of\nI This testimony  in sum reflects  that Hill, at various  points\nin his life,  was a nice  boy and very  pleasant.  He was helpful  to\nhis  parents  and neighbors  and  none  of the witnesses  believed  he\ncommitted  the murder.  The  State’s  objections  were  sustained  with\nregard  to efforts  by defense  counsel  to permit  Hill’s  mother  to\ntestify  concerning  how she cared for children  when Hill was growing\nup. The State’s  objection  was also  sustained  as to the testimony\nof Hill’s  father  regarding  the father’s  disability  from  a recent\nheart attack.\n2 The court  found  based  upon  five  (5) statutory  aggravating\nfactors:  (i) that  Hill  had  previously  been  convicted  of another\ncapital  offense  or violent  felony;  (2)  Hill  knowingly  created \ngreat  risk  of harm  or danger  to many  persons;  (3) the murder  was\ncommitted  while  Hill  was engaged  in the commission  of a robbery;\n(4)  the  murder  was  committed  for  the  purpose  of  avoiding \npreventing  a lawful  arrest  or escaping  from  custody,  and (5) the\nmurder  was  cold,  calculated  and  premeditated;  and  only  one  (I)\nmitigating  factor,  that Hill was twenty-three  years old at the time\nthe crime was committed,  articulated  in the sentencing  order.\n\nthe  death  penalty  in Hill  v. State,  515  So.2d  176 (Fla. 1987),\ncert. denied,  485 U.S. 993 (1988), however the court struck the CCP\naggravator.\nOn November  9, 1989,  the  Governor  signed  a death  warrant\nscheduling  Hill’s execution  for January  25, 1990.

TCA  90-\n40023-WS.\nHill continued  to prosecute  his appeal in the Eleventh  Circuit\nCourt  of  Appeals,  however,  when  the  time  came  for  filing  his\nInitial  Brief,  he  filed  a motion  to  have  the  matter  held  in\nabeyance  in that Court until such time, as the issues upon which he\nprevailed,  were resolved  by the state  courts.\nThe  case  returned  to the  Florida  Supreme  Court  on a limited\nremand  for the purpose  of ascertaining  whether  the striking  of one\nof  the  statutory  aggravating  factors  (CCP)  and  factoring \n6\n\n/\n¢\n/\n!\n\"unrebutted\",  nonstatutory  mitigating  evidence  would  have  resulted\nin  the  imposition  of  the  death  penalty.  The  issue  before  the\nFlorida  Supreme  Court  was  what  effect  the  ~unrebutted  nonstatutory\nmitigation\"  tendered  by  Hill  would  have  had  if  four,  rather  than\nfive,  statutory  aggravating  factors  were  presented  to  the  trial\ncourt  and  whether,  the  aforenoted  omissions  constituted  harmless\nerror.\n7\n\nThe direct  appeal  was reopened  on a limited  basis  in Hill v.\nFlorida,  643 So.2d  1071 (Fla.  1994):\nHill  raises  eleven  claims  in this  appeal, 2 only  one of\nwhich  deals  with  the Parker  issue.  Hill  maintains  that\nall eleven  claims  are properly  before  this Court  because\nthe  federal  district  court  found  constitutional  error\nthat  ’infected’  Hill’s  sentence,  thus  effectively\nreopening  his  direct  appeal  as to any  issue,  the State\nmaintains  that all but the Parker issues  are procedurally\nbarred.\nIn granting  Hill’s motion to reopen his direct appeal,  we\naccepted  jurisdiction  for  the  limited  purpose  of\nconsidering  the federal district  court’s  partial grant of\nhis  habeas  petition.  In no way did we intend  to reopen\nHill’s  direct  appeal  for the purpose  of allowing  him to\nraise  other  issues  that  are procedurally  barred  either\nbecause  he  previously  failed  to raise  them  on direct\nappeal  or because  the issues  were  previously  determined\nto  be without  merit.  Consequently,  we  limit  our\nconsideration  in this  appeal  to the  Parker  issue  and\ndecline  to consider  the other  issues  raised  by Hill.\n2 Hill claims  that: (I) the judge’s  and jury’s\napplication  of  cold,  calculated,  and\npremeditated  was harmful  error;  (2) the trial\njudge  erred  in failing  to weigh  nonstatutory\nmitigating  evidence;  (3)  the  failure \nproperly  instruct  the  jury  on  the  improper\ndoubling  of aggravating  factors  warrants  a new\npenalty  phase  proceeding;  (4) irrelevant  and\ninflammatory  evidence  perverted  the  penalty\nphase  proceedings;  (5) blacks  were erroneously\nexcluded  from the jury solely  on the basis  of\nrace;  (6)  the  trial  judge  erroneously\nresponded  to  questions  from  the  jury  and\nrefused  to disclose  to Hill the content  of the\nquestions;  (7)  the  trial  judge  erroneously\nrefused  to  allow  Hill  to  present  certain\nmitigating  evidence;  (8)  the  trial  judge\nerroneously  refused  to excuse  certain  jurors;\n(9) the jury instruction  shifted  the burden \nHill to prove  death  was inappropriate  and the\ncourt  used  the  wrong  standard  in sentencing\nHill;  (I0) the jury’s  sense  of responsibility\n\n/\nwas  diluted  because  it  was  told  that  its\ndecision  was  merely  advisory;  and  (ii)  the\njury  was improperly  instructed  regarding  the\noffenses  for which  Hill  was  charged.  643\nSo.2d  at 1073.\nFollowing  remand,  the  district  court  concluded  that  the\nFlorida  Supreme  Court  had satisfied  the dictates  of Parker,  and\ndenied  relief.

Later  that day, appellant\nand his accomplice,  Cliff Jackson,  drove to Pensacola  and\nrobbed  a savings  and loan  association  at gunpoint.  When\nthe police arrived during the robbery,  appellant  fled out\nthe back of the savings  and loan building.  Jackson exited\nthrough  the  front  door,  where  he  was  apprehended\nimmediately.  Appellant  approached  two police  officers\nfrom  behind  as  they  attempted  to  handcuff  Jackson.\nTestimony  established  that appellant  drew his pistol  and\nshot the officers,  killing  one and wounding  the other.

State,\n2]\n\nCase  no.  05-8731,  filed  on or about  January  20,  2006,  from  the\ndenial  of postconviction  review  by the Florida  Supreme  Court.\nThe  Florida  Supreme  Court  rejected  the  argument  in Hill  v.\nState,  2006 Fla. LEXIS  8 (Fla.  Jan. 17, 2006).\nHill’s  claim is that a research  letter published  in April\n2005 in The Lancet  presents  new scientific  evidence  that\nFlorida’s  procedure  for carrying  out lethal injection  may\nsubject  the inmate  to unnecessary  pain.  See Leonidas  G.\nKoniaris  et  al.,  Inadequate  Anaesthesia  in  Lethal\nInjection  for  Execution,  365  Lancet  1412  (2005). \nsupports  this  claim  with  an affidavit  from  one  of the\nstudy’s  authors,  Dr. David  A. Lubarsky,  asserting  that\nFlorida’s  procedure  is substantially  similar  to  the\nprocedures  used  in the  other  states  evaluated  in  the\nstudy.  Hill  ultimately  asserts  that  the information  in\nthis study is new information  not previously  available  to\nthis Court when it decided  Sims v. State,  754 So. 2d 657\n(Fla. 2000). The trial court denied this claim. We agree.\nSee also,  Bieghler  v. State,  2005  Ind. LEXIS  1156 (Ind.  Dec.  28,\n2005),  the Indiana  Supreme  Court likewise  rejected  the defendant’s\nchallenge  regarding  Indiana’  s method  of  execution  by  lethal\n11\ninjection  based  on The Lancet  research  letters.\n11\nBieghler  cites  no  authority  for  the\nproposition  that  he is  entitled  to  a \"pain\nfree\"  execution,  and  we  have  found  none.\nCompare  Johnson  v. State,  584  N.E.2d  1092,\n1107 (Ind.  1992)  (fact  that  electrocution \nnot  cause  instantaneous  and  painless  death\ndoes  not  mean  that  method  involves  the\nunnecessary  and wanton  infliction  of pain).\nBoth the federal  and state constitutions  prohibit  \"cruel\nand  unusual  punishment.\"  Punishment  may  not  include\ntorture,  lingering  death,  or the unnecessary  and wanton\ninfliction  of pain;  the method  must  be compatible  with\ncontemporary  standards  of society.  See, e.g., Estelle  v.\nGamble,  429 U.S.  97, 102,  97 S.Ct.  285,  50 L.Ed.2d  251\n\n/ (1976); accord Moore v. State, 771 N.E.2d 46, 55-56 (Ind.\n2002).  Claims  that  lethal  injection  violates  the\nprohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  have\nbeen rejected  by courts  throughout  the county  in states\nthat  appear  to  have  a drug  protocol  the  same  as  or\nsimilar  to Indiana’s.  See, e.g.,  Beardslee  v. Woodford,\n395 F.3d 1064, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 125 \nCt. 982,  160  L.Ed.2d  910  (2005);  Co~er  v.

LEXIS 828, 2005 WL 2615801,  \"9-’12  (Tenn.  Oct. 17,\n2005) (noting  that lethal  injection  is \"commonly  thought\nto be  the  most  humane  form  of  execution\");  see  also\nMcConnell  v. State, 102 P.3d 606, 615-17 (Nev. 2004) (the\nabsence  of a codified  protocol  does  not  render  lethal\ninjection  an unconstitutional  method  of execution  absent\nsome  showing  that  executions  in  the  state  have  been\nadministered  in  a cruel  or  unusual  manner).  But  see\nHarris  v. Johnson,  323  F.Supp.2d  797,  809  (S.D.  Tex.\n2004)  (concluding  prisoner  showed  likelihood  of success\nsufficient  to support  a temporary  restraining  order),\nvacated,  376  F.3d  414  (5th  Cir.  2004)  (determining\nprisoner  had unreasonably  delayed  bringing  challenge  to\nexecution  method).\nWe have previously  rejected  claims  that lethal  injection\nis cruel  and unusual  punishment.  See,  e.g.,  Johnson  v.\nState,  827 N.E.2d  547, 552-53  (Ind. 2005) (order  denying\npermission  to litigate  successive  post-conviction  claims\nin capital  case);  Ritchie  v. State,  809  N.E.2d  258,\n262-63  (Ind. 2004);  Moore, 771 N.E.2d at 55-56 (observing\nthat  executions  must  \"be  performed  in a manner  that\navoids  unnecessary  or wanton  infliction  of pain\"  but\nconcluding  that  lethal  injection  does  not  constitute\nwanton  infliction  of  pain).  We  have  also  noted  that\n\"judicial  intervention  in  the  details  of  execution\nmethods  is by its nature  highly  restrained.\"  Benefiel  v.\nState,  716 N.E.2d  906,  918 n.8 (Ind.  1999).\n\nBieghler  has  not  shown  a reasonable  possibility  of\nsucceeding  on  his  claim  because,  even  if  Indiana’s\nprotocol  was  developed  without  input  from  a person\ntrained  in clinical  anesthesiology,  Bieghler  has  not\nshown  the protocol  presents  any  unacceptable  risk  of a\nlingering  death  or the wanton  infliction  of pain  in his\ncase.  In this  respect,  his claim  is like  the others  we\nhave  rejected.  See  Johnson,  827  N.E.2d  at  552-53\n(rejecting  challenge  to the drug protocol);  Ritchie,  809\nN.E.2d  at  262-63  (rejecting  prisoner’s  unsupported\nassertion  that  lethal  injection  inflicts  \"unnecessary\npain\");  Moore, 771 N.E.2d at 55 n.3 (rejecting  prisoner’s\nunsubstantiated  contention  that his obesity  and resulting\ndifficulty  in  locating  a suitable  vein  would  present\ndifficulty  in his case).  In view of this decision,  we do\nnot  address  the  State’s  argument  that  this  claim  is\nprocedurally  defaulted  because  Bieghler  waited  too long\nto raise it.\n24\n\n/\nIn Hill’s  postconviction  sojourn,  he  contended  that  \"new\nevidence\"  has come  to light  which  brings  into  question  the State\nCourt’s  holding  in Sims v. State,  754 So.2d 657 (Fla. 2000), cert.\ndenied,  754 U.S. 657 (2000).  Albeit,  the Sims Court  rejected  the\nparade  of \"horribles  that  could  happen  if a mishap  occurs  during\nthe execution. \" Sims,  754 So.2d at 668, Hill claimed  \"recent\"\nempirical  evidence  of  the  \"infliction  of  cruel  and  unusual\npunishment\"  of execution  by lethal  injection  based  on research\nletters  by Dr. Davis A. Lubarsky,  published  in the April  16, 2005,\nissue  of THE LANCET.  Hill argues  that \"the scientific  critique  of\nthe use  of sodium  pentothal,  pancuronium  bromide,  and potassium\nchloride  creates  a foreseeable  risk  of  the  gratuitous  and\nu\"n1n2ecessary  infliction  of pain on a person  being  executed.\n12\nThe concluding  paragraph  of the research  letters  provides:\n25\n\n\"Our  data  suggest  that  anaesthesia  methods  in lethal\ninjection  in the USA  are  flawed.  Failures  in protocol\ndesign,  implementation,  monitoring  and review  might  have\nled  to the unnecessary  suffering  of a t least  some  of\nthose  executed.  Because  participation  of doctors  in\nprotocol  design  or execution  is ethically  prohibited,\nadequate  anaesthesia  cannot  be certain.  Therefore,  to\nprevent  unnecessary  cruelty  and suffering,  cessation  and\npublic  review  of  lethal  injections  is  warranted.\nKoniaris  L.G., Zimmers T.A., Lubarsji  D.A., Sheldon J.P.,\nInadequate  anaesthesia  in lethal injection  for execution.\nVol.  365. THE LANCET  1412-14  (April  16, 2005).\"\n26\n\nThe research  letters  of Dr. Lubarsky  and colleagues,  are not\nnew as far as any objections  to the use of lethal  injection  as a\nmethod  of execution. 13  Sims,  754  So.2d  at 668  footnote  1914\n(Emphasis  added).\n13 Unless  Hill demonstrated  that the latest  research  letters\neither  are so new as to not be unearthed  or are so unique  that new\nlight  is shed on this issue,  the state  trial court and the Florida\nSupreme  Court  were  bound  by  their  earlier  rulings--finding\nexecution  by lethal  injection  constitutional.  Robinson  v. State,\n30  Fla.  L.Weekly  S576,  2005  Fla.  LEXIS  1452  (Fla.  July  7,\n2005)  (affirming  summary  denial  of claim  that execution  by lethal\ninjection  is unconstitutional,  holding  that  Supreme  Court  has\nrepeatedly rejected the claim as being without merit); Ell__l!~_~e v.\nState,  911 So.2d 57 (Fla.  2005) (affirming  summary  denial  of claim\nthat  execution  by  electrocution  or  lethal  injection  is\nunconstitutional  because  it  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual\npunishment,  noting  that Supreme  Court  has repeatedly  rejected  the\nclaim  as being  without  merit);  Johnson  v. State,  904  So.2d  400\n(Fla.  2005)  (holding  claim  that  execution  by lethal  injection\nconstitutes  cruel  and unusual  punishment  in violation  of both the\nFlorida  and  United  States  Constitutions  is without  merit  and was\nproperly  denied  without  an evidentiary  hearing);  Parker  v. State,\n904 So.2d  370 (Fla.  2005)  (upholding  summary  denial  of claim  that\nexecution  by lethal injection  or electrocution  is cruel and unusual\npunishment  because  the Court  has repeatedly  held that neither  form\nof execution  is cruel  and unusual  punishment).\n14 n19 Professor  Radelet  testified  that  lethal  injection  is\nthe  most  commonly  \"botched\"  method  of  execution  in the  United\nStates,  with  Virginia  and  Texas  being  the  two  states  with  the\nhighest  number of mishaps.  He claims  that 5.2 percent  of the lethal\ninjections  encountered  unanticipated  problems.  He also  provided\nexamples  of what could go wrong during the lethal injection,  citing\nto  specific  examples  throughout  the  country.  The  professor\nadmitted,  however,  that  the  documented  occurrences  in his study\ncame from newspaper  accounts  of the execution  and did not come from\nfirst-hand,  eyewitness  accounts  or formal  findings  following  a\nhearing  or investigation  into the matter.\n27\n\nHill  has  not  shown  how  any  of  the  lower  courts  have\nmisapplied  the law governing  his 42 U.S.C.  §1983  a~ion.  Moreover\nHill is not entitled  to any stay pursuant  to the Eleventh  Circuit’s\nDr. Lipman,  a neuropharmacologist,  provided  examples  of what coul~\nhappen  if  the  drugs  are  not  administered  properly  or  if  the\npersonnel  are  not  adequately  trained  to  administer  the  lethal\nsubstances.  For example,  if too low a dose of sodium  pentothal  is\nadministered,  the  inmate  could  feel  pain  because  low dosages  of\nsuch drug have the opposite  effect--it  makes  the pain  more acute.\nIn addition,  if the drugs are not injected  in the proper order, the\ninmate  could  suffer  pain  because  he  would  not  be  properly\nanesthetized.  Dr. Lipman  further  noted  that if the drugs  are not\nadministered  in a timely  manner,  the sodium  pentothal  could  wear\noff,  causing  the  inmate  to regain  consciousness.  However,  Dr.\nLipman  admitted  that  lethal  injection  is a simple  procedure  and\nthat if the lethal substances  to be used by DOC are administered  in\nthe proper  dosages  and in the proper  sequence  at the appropriate\ntime,  they will \"bring  about  the desired  effect.\"  He also admitted\nthat at high dosages  of the lethal  substances  intended  be used  by\nthe  DOC,  death  would  certainly  result  quickly  and  without\nsensation.\n28\n\nopinion  holding:  \"It is clear to us that the district  court lacked\njurisdiction  to consider  appellant’s  claim  because  it it  the\nfunctional  equivalent  of a successive  habeas petition  and he failed\nto obtain leave of the court to file it. ¯ ¯  we DENY appellant’s\napplication  for a stay Pf his execution  pending  appeal.\"\n\nCONCLUSION\nHill  is entitled  to no relief  and  the petition  for writ  of\ncertiorari  should  be denied  in all  respects  and  any request  for\nstay denied.\nRespectfully  submitted,\nCHARLES  J.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nTALLAHASSEE DIVISION\nCLARENCE HILL.\nPlaintiff,\n***CAPITAL***\nv. Case No.: 4:06-cv-032-SPM\nJAMES CROSBY, Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of Corrections,\nin his official capacity; and\nCHARLES CRIST, JR., Attorney\nGeneral, in his official capacity,\nDefendants.\n_______________________________/\nORDER DISMISSING COMPLAINT FOR\nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\nTHIS CAUSE comes before the Court upon the “Verified Complaint for\nDeclaratory & Injunctive Relief” (doc. 2) and all accompanying attachments and\nappendices filed by Plaintiff through counsel on January 20, 2006, and the\nresponse from the Attorney General (doc. 6) also filed January 21, 2006.  For the\nfollowing reasons, the Court finds that the motion must be dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction.\nThis case has a long history dating back to Plaintiff’s original death\nsentence in May of 1983.  The procedural history is set out in the Florida\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion of January 17, 2006, Hill v. State, 2006 WL 91302 (Fla.\nJan. 17, 2006), demonstrating that Plaintiff has filed previous petitions for habeas\ncorpus, both in the federal and state courts.  See, e.g., Hill v. Dugger, 556 So. 2d\n1385 (Fla. 1990); Hill v. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999); Hill v. Butterworth,\n941 F. Supp. 1129 (N.D. Fla. 1996).\nPlaintiff now brings the instant suit as a motion for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for alleged prospective violations of his\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment (doc. 2-1 at 2), claiming that\ndeath by lethal injection causes pain and unnecessary suffering.  In support of\nhis claim, Plaintiff points to “newly-discovered evidence” in the form of an article\nfrom the medical journal The Lancet, which purportedly found that inmates (in the\ncases studied by the researchers) had felt pain during their executions due to\ninsufficient amounts of anesthetic in their bloodstream.  Plaintiff seeks a\npermanent injunction barring the execution of his death sentence.  \nThis very issue was dealt with by the Eleventh Circuit in Robinson v.\nCrosby, 358 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004).  In Robinson, the appellant filed a § 1983\naction in the Middle District of Florida alleging that “lethal injection causes those\nwho are executed pain and suffering while they are paralyzed and unable to\ncommunicate.”  Id. at 1282.  The district court dismissed the petition for lack of\njurisdiction, holding that the appellant’s § 1983 action was the functional\nequivalent of a successive habeas corpus petition, which would subject him to\nthe authorization requirements of 28 U.S.C.  § 2244.  Absent the permission of\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit, the appellant was not authorized to file a successive\npetition, and thus the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it.  Id. at 1283-\n84.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit explicitly upheld the district court’s finding:\nWe conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Robinson's §\n1983 complaint for lack of jurisdiction. A § 1983 claim seeking\nrelief--including a TRO, preliminary injunction, or a stay of\nexecution--from a sentence of death as cruel and unusual\npunishment is the \"functional equivalent\" of a successive habeas\npetition.  The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Robinson's\nclaim because he failed to apply to this Court for permission to file a\nsuccessive habeas petition.  We further note that such an\napplication to file a successive habeas petition would be due to be\ndenied in any event. See In re Provenzano, 215 F.3d 1233,\n1235-36 (11th Cir.2000), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1256 (2000)\n(concluding that a claim that lethal injection constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment does not meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. §\n2244(b)(2)(A) or (B)).\nId. at 1284 (remaining internal citations omitted).  Plaintiff’s claim, like that of the\nappellant in Robinson, is virtually identical to those raised in other cases in which\nstays of execution have been denied.  Id. at 1283 (citing In re Roe, 540 U.S.\n1171 (2004); Vickers v. Johnson, 540 U.S. 1170 (2004); Zimmerman v. Johnson,\n540 U.S. 1087 (2003); and Beck v. Rowsey, 540 U.S. 1098 (2004) (Supreme\nCourt vacated stay entered by district court)).\nPlaintiff’s claim of “newly-discovered evidence” is insufficient to overcome\nthe procedural bar in this case.  Plaintiff cites the Lancet article as conclusive\nproof that inmates do feel pain during the lethal injection procedure.  He details\nthe injection process, noting that sodium pentothal is first administered as an\nanesthetic, followed by pancuronium bromide, a paralytic agent which prevents\n\nthe inmate from moving or otherwise showing pain or discomfort.  The final\nchemical to be injected is potassium chloride, which causes the actual death by\nstopping all movement of the heart and suffocating the inmate.  The Lancet\nresearchers found that toxicology reports in their case studies demonstrated that\ninsufficient amounts of anesthetic were injected, permitting the inmates to\nexperience the feelings of being suffocated and having a heart attack, yet\nremaining paralyzed by the pancuronium.  While Florida’s procedure was not\nexamined in the study, Plaintiff argues that Florida’s practice is “substantially\nsimilar” and thus poses the same risk to inmates.  \nThese exact issues were raised and disposed of in Robinson, in which the\nEleventh Circuit referred to affidavits filed in that case addressing “the effects of\nthe drugs used during lethal injection, how they each cause pain and suffering,\nand particularly how the pancuronium bromide chemical paralyzes the person\nand masks the pain and suffering being incurred.”  Id. at 1285 n.4.  An additional\naffidavit “discusse[d] how the level of potassium chloride being used in the lethal\ninjection context may not cause actual cardiac arrest but may result in death by\nsuffocation due to lack of oxygen.”  Id.\nWhile the Lancet article itself may be new, having just been published last\nyear, the factual basis of Plaintiff’s claim has certainly been raised and disposed\nof in numerous cases, both in Florida and in other states.  Plaintiff has made no\nshowing that he could not have discovered these underlying predicates through\nthe exercise of due diligence.  See in re Provenzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1236-37\n\n(11th Cir. 2000).1\nBecause Plaintiff’s motion raises no true issues of newly-discovered\nevidence, it is the functional equivalent of a successive petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus.  Robinson, 358 F.3d at 1284.  As such, he should have first sought the\npermission of the Eleventh Circuit under 28 U.S.C. § 2244 to file such a\nsuccessive petition.  There is no indication in the record whatsoever that Plaintiff\nhas followed this procedure.  Absent authorization from the Eleventh Circuit,  this\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to entertain the instant successive petition.\nAccordingly, it is\nORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff’s complaint/motion for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief (doc. 2) is hereby dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction.  No stay of execution shall issue in this case.\nDONE AND ORDERED this twenty-first day of January, 2006.\ns / Stephan P. Mickle     \nStephan P. Mickle\nUnited States District Judge\n/pao\n1\n  The Supreme Court of Florida also noted in its opinion that\n[a]cross the nation, courts have rejected claims that The Lancet study requires a new\nevaluation of the constitutionality of lethal injection.  See Brown v. Crawford, 408 F.3d\n1027 (8th Cir.2005) (dismissing an appellant's motion for a stay of execution despite the\nfact that the appellant based his claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in part on The Lancet\nstudy at issue here); Bieghler v. State, 839 N.E.2d 691 (Ind.2005) (finding The Lancet\nstudy was not sufficient to establish “a reasonable probability that Indiana's method of\nexecution violates the federal or state constitution”).\n        2006 WL at *6.\n  ",

TODD DOSS\nFlorida Bar No. 0910384\n725 Southeast Baya Drive\nSuite 102\nLake City, FL 32025-6092\nTelephone (386) 755-9119\nCOUNSEL FOR PETITIONER\n\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\n1. When considering whether to “invoke their equitable\npowers” to grant injunctive relief or to dismiss a suit as “filed\ntoo late in the day,” were the federal district court and the\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals required to consider the fact\nthat the Eleventh Circuit’s own controlling precedent indicated\nthat the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear Petitioner’s\n§ 1983 action challenging Florida’s use of lethal injection as\nthe method of carrying out a death sentence at all relevant times\nprior to this Court’s decision in Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct.\n2096, 2104 (2006)?\n2. When undertaking to weigh the equities in deciding\nwhether to grant injunctive relief, were the federal district\ncourt and the Eleventh Circuit of Appeals required to consider\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s inaction when it failed to issue the\nmandate and only returned jurisdiction to the district court for\nfurther proceedings after the Governor of Florida rescheduled\nPetitioner’s execution for August 17, 2006, citing the lack of\njudicial activity (i.e. though this Court issued its opinion on\nJune 12, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit did not remand to the\ndistrict court until August 29, 2006), thereby depriving\nPetitioner of the opportunity to proceed on his § 1983 action\nduring that two month time period when no execution date was set?\n \n-i-\n\n3. When undertaking to weigh the equities in deciding\nwhether to grant injunctive relief or to dismiss a § 1983\nchallenging a method of execution, is a federal court required to\nconsider any aspect of the merits of the § 1983 and/or the\nactions of the State in scheduling the execution and its\nprerogative to alter the method or the protocol up until the\nexecution, or is the equitable analysis to be solely concerned\nwith the timing of Petitioner’s initiation of the action?\n-ii-\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPAGE\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED.......................................... i\nTABLE OF CONTENTS............................................ iii\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES......................................... iv\nCITATION TO OPINIONS BELOW................................... 2\nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION.................................... 2\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED............. 2\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY........................................... 3\nFACTS RELEVANT TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED........................ 7\nTHE FEDERAL COURTS’ RULINGS.................................. 15\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT................................ 17\nTHIS COURT SHOULD REVIEW THE ISSUES SURROUNDING \nTHE FEDERAL COURTS’ CONSIDERATION OF EQUITIES \nIN DENYING MR.

Petitioner respectfully urges that this\nHonorable Court issue its writ of certiorari to review Order of\nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n-1-\n\nCITATION TO OPINIONS BELOW\nThe decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in\nthis cause appears as Hill v. McDonough, Case No. 06-14927, (11th\nCir. 2006), and is attached to this petition as Appendix A.  The\ndecision of the United States District Court, Northern District\nof Florida, Tallahassee Division appears as Hill v. McDonough,\nCase No. 4:06-cv-032-SPM, (N.D. Fla. 2006) and is attached to\nthis petition as Appendix B.  \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\nPetitioner invokes this Court’s jurisdiction to grant the\nPetition for a Writ of Certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit Court\nof Appeals on the basis of 28 U.S.C. Section 1257.  The Eleventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion denying relief on\nSeptember 15, 2006.\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\n[N]or be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law U.S. Const. amend. V.  \n[N]or [shall] cruel and unusual punishments [be] inflicted. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VIII.\nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life [or]\nliberty . . . without due process of law; nor deny to\nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\nof the laws.  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. \nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\nor Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects or\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\n-2-\n\nto the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\nbe liable to the party injured in an action at law,\nsuit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. \n42 U.S.C.  § 1983 \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAppellant, Clarence Hill, was convicted of first degree\nmurder in 1983.  On appeal, his conviction was affirmed, but his\nsentence was vacated.  Following a second sentencing proceeding,\nMr. Hill was again sentenced to death, and the Florida Supreme\nCourt affirmed. Hill v. State, 515 So.2d 176 (Fla. 1987), cert.\ndenied, Hill v. State, 108 S.Ct. 1302 (1988).\nOn November 9, 1989, the Governor of Florida signed a death\nwarrant scheduling Mr. Hill’s execution for January 25, 1990. \nMr. Hill filed an expedited postconviction motion, which was\ndenied on January 18, 1990.  On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court\ndenied relief. Hill v. State, 556 So. 2d 1385 (Fla. 1990).\nMr. Hill subsequently filed a Motion to Stay Execution and a\nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Florida on January 27, 1990. \nAfter granting a stay of execution, on August 31, 1992, the \ndistrict court granted relief to Mr. Hill on a sentencing issue.\nOn remand, the Florida Supreme Court again denied relief.\nHill v. State, 643 So. 2d 1071 (Fla. 1995).  Mr. Hill’s\nsubsequent state and federal applications, including his federal\nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, were unsuccessful. See Hill\n-3-\n\nv. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999), Hill v. State, 528 U.S.\n1087 (2000), Hill v. State, 2006 Fla. LEXIS 8 (January 17, 2006).\nOn Friday, January 20, 2006, Mr. Hill brought an action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Florida, Tallahassee Division.  Mr. Hill\nalleged violations of his right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution.  On Saturday, January 21, 2006, the\ndistrict court dismissed Mr. Hill’s complaint for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for lack of jurisdiction.  Thereafter, on\nMonday, January 23, 2006, Mr. Hill filed a Notice of Appeal and\nby separate pleading an application for stay of execution.  On\nJanuary 24, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied\nhis application for stay. The Eleventh Circuit went on to hold\nthat Mr. Hill’s action was a successive petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus and that any application for leave to file a\nsuccessive petition would be denied under § 2244(b)(2).  Hill v.\nCrosby, 437 F.3d 1084 (11th Cir. 2006).\nMr. Hill then filed a petition for certiorari review and an\napplication for stay by separate pleading in the Supreme Court of\nthe United States.  At 7:00 p.m., January 24, 2006, Justice\nKennedy issued a stay until the full court could consider Mr.\nHill’s pleadings.  The following day, January 25, 2006, the full\ncourt granted Mr. Hill a stay and granted certiorari.  The stay\n-4-\n\nwas to remain in effect until the Supreme Court of the United\nStates rendered a decision in the case.  Hill v. Crosby, 126\nS.Ct. 1189 (2006).  Subsequently, on June 12, 2006, the Court\nrendered a 9-0 decision that reversed and remanded the cause back\nto the Eleventh Circuit for proceedings consistent with the\nopinion.  Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct 2096 (2006). The Supreme\nCourt held that Mr. Hill’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was\nessentially comparable to that brought in Nelson v. Campbell, 124\nS.Ct. 2117 (2004), and that Mr. Hill should be allowed to proceed\nunder § 1983.  See Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct 2096 (2006).  The\nSupreme Court’s decision became final on July 14, 2006.\nA panel of the Eleventh Circuit received the case on remand\non July 18, 2006.  On August 17, 2006, the State of Florida\narbitrarily scheduled Mr. Hill’s execution date for September 20,\n2006.  Thereafter, Mr. Hill filed in the Eleventh Circuit his\nMotion for Immediate Remand of This Cause to the District Court,\nvia overnight mail on August 23, 2006.  The Eleventh Circuit then\nremanded this cause on August 29, 2006 to the district court,\nwith the mandate being received on August 31, 2006.\nUndersigned counsel’s office was contacted by telephone by\nthe district court on August 31, 2006.  At the time of the call,\nundersigned counsel was out of town conducting attorney visits\nwith clients on Florida’s Death Row, including Mr. Hill.\nUndersigned counsel then arrived back at his office at\n-5-\n\napproximately 5:00 p.m.  At this time, undersigned learned\nthrough his assistant of the district court’s directive that all\npleadings in this matter were to be filed by the parties prior to\n12:00 p.m., September 1, 2006.  Undersigned counsel, a sole\npractitioner, then had less than twenty-four hours to comply with\nthe district court’s order. Subsequently, Mr. Hill filed a motion\nto file an amended complaint, an amended complaint, a motion for\nexpedited discovery, propounded interrogatories, requested\nadmissions, requested production, and moved for a temporary\ninjunction staying Mr. Hill’s execution.  On that very same date,\nSeptember 1, 2006, the district court entered its Order\nDismissing Complaint.  The following business day, September 5,\n2006, Mr. Hill filed his motion for reconsideration and his\nmotion for temporary injunction. The motion for temporary\ninjunction was intended upon being filed electronically on\nSeptember 1, 2006; however, either due to an error in\ntransmission or counsel’s error due to fatigue from working all\nnight to comply with the district’s court order the motion was\nnot docketed until September 5, 2006.  On September 11, 2006, the\ndistrict court issued an Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration\nand Motion for Stay. \nPetitioner then filed his Application for Stay of Execution\nand for Expedited Appeal on September 13, 2006 before the\n-6-\n\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.1 The State of Florida filed a\nresponse in opposition on September 14, 2006. On September 15,\n2006, the Eleventh Circuit denied the stay, denied the request\nfor expedited briefing and refused to hear Mr. Hill’s appeal\nbased upon its determination that Mr. Hill was dilatory in\nseeking relief. This petition for certiorari follows the Eleventh\nCircuit’s erroneous ruling. \nFACTS RELEVANT TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED\nAfter this Court’s decision in Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct\n2096 (2006), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals received the\nremand on July 18, 2006.  Subsequently, in an apparent response\nto the fact that thirty days passed without any action by the\nEleventh Circuit, on August 17, 2006 Florida’s Governor reset Mr.\nHill’s execution date for Wednesday, September 20, 2006. See\nAppendix C, Letter from Attorney General Charlie Crist to\nGovernor Bush dated August 17, 2006.\nDespite the action by the Governor, the Eleventh Circuit\nrefrained from remanding Mr. Hill’s case back to the district\ncourt for consideration of his § 1983 action. Only after Mr. Hill\nfiled a motion for immediate remand did the circuit court remand\nthis cause on August 29, 2006. See Hill v. McDonough, No. 06-\n     1 The Application for Stay and Expedited Appeal was not filed on\nSeptember 12, 2006 because counsel for Mr. Hill was arguing\nbefore the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Sweet\nv. McDonough, Case No. 05-15199.\n-7-\n\n10621 (11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006).2 \nOn remand to the district court, in his amended complaint\nfiled under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Mr. Hill challenged the three drug\nprotocol used by the State of Florida in its lethal injection\nprocedure.  The challenge was premised on the study published in\nthe medical journal THE LANCET.  The study was published in\nApril, 2005, and detailed the results of research on the effects\nof chemicals in lethal injections. See Koniaris L.G., Zimmers\nT.A., Lubarski D.A., Sheldon J.P., Inadequate anaesthesia in\nlethal injection for execution, Vol 365, THE LANCET 1412-14\n(April 16, 2005).  This study confirmed, through the analysis of\nempirical after-the-fact data, that the scientific critique of\nthe use of sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium\nchloride creates a foreseeable risk of the gratuitous and\nunnecessary infliction of pain on a person being executed.  The\nauthors found that in toxicology reports in the cases they\nstudied, post-mortem concentrations of thiopental in the blood\nwere lower than that required for surgery in 43 of 49 executed\ninmates (88%).  Moreover, 21 of the 49 executed inmates (43%) had\nconcentrations consistent with awareness, as the inmates had an\ninadequate amount of sodium pentothal in their bloodstream to\nprovide anesthesia.  In other words, in close to half of the\ncases, the prisoner felt the suffering of suffocation from\n     2 The mandate issued on Thursday, August 31, 2006. \n-8-\n\npancuronium bromide, and the burning through the veins followed\nby the heart attack caused by the potassium chloride.3\nMr. Hill also amended his complaint to reflect new\ndevelopments that had occurred subsequent to the granting of\ncertiorari by this Court.  Further, Mr. Hill argued that these\ndevelopments clearly supported his request for discovery.  For\nexample, in California, shortly before his execution date was\nscheduled, Michael Morales filed a challenge to the lethal\ninjection protocol used by the State of California in its\nexecutions. See Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp 2d 1037, 1042\n(N.D. Cal. 2006).  Specifically, like Mr. Hill,  Morales\nchallenged the amount of sodium pentothal used and the use of\npancuronium bromide in its execution protocol. Id. at 1044.  In\nCalifornia, a condemned inmate is administered five (5) grams of\nsodium pentothal, whereas in Florida a condemned inmate is\nadministered \"‘no less than’ two grams of sodium pentothal, an\nultra-short-acting barbiturate which renders the inmate\nunconscious”. Sims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 666 (Fla. 2000).  \nAfter the United States Supreme Court stayed Mr. Hill’s\nexecution, a district court judge in California granted Morales\ndiscovery.  Thus, Morales received the detailed execution logs\nfrom several of the recent executions in the State of California.\n     3As noted in Mr. Hill’s § 1983 action, the chemical process\nutilized in executions in Florida to the best of Mr. Hill’s\nknowledge is identical to that identified in the study.\n-9-\n\nId.  The logs suggest that, contrary to the theoretical principle\nthat a high dose of sodium pentothal causes a condemned’s loss of\nconsciousness and respiration to cease within a minute, in many\nexecutions respiration and consciousness do not cease several\nminutes after the administration of sodium pentothal. Id. at\n1044-1045.  In Morales, the district court noted the following\npertinent details about the execution logs:\nJaturun Siripongs, executed February 9, 1999: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:04 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:08 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:09\na.m., four minutes after the administration of sodium\nthiopental began and one minute after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began.\nManuel Babbitt, executed May 4, 1999: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:28 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:31 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:33\na.m., five minutes after the administration of sodium\nthiopental began and two minutes after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began. In\naddition, brief spasmodic movements were observed in\nthe upper chest at 12:32 a.m. \n \nDarrell Keith Rich, executed March 15, 2000: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:06 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:08 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:08\na.m., when pancuronium bromide was injected, two\nminutes after the administration of sodium thiopental\nbegan. Chest movements were observed from 12:09 a.m. to\n12:10 a.m. \n \nStephen Wayne Anderson, executed January 29, 2002: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:17 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:19 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:22\na.m., five minutes after the administration of sodium\nthiopental began and three minutes after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began.\n-10-\n\n \nStanley Tookie Williams, executed December 13, 2005:\nThe administration of sodium thiopental began at 12:22\na.m., the administration of pancuronium bromide began\nat 12:28 a.m., and the administration of potassium\nchloride began at 12:32 a.m. or 12:34 a.m., yet\nrespirations did not cease until either 12:28 a.m. or\n12:34 a.m. -- that is, either six or twelve minutes\nafter the administration of sodium thiopental began,\neither when or six minutes after the administration of\npancuronium bromide began, and either four minutes\nbefore or when the administration of potassium chloride\nbegan.\n \nClarence Ray Allen, executed January 17, 2006: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:18\na.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:27 a.m.,\nwhen pancuronium bromide was injected, nine minutes\nafter the administration of sodium thiopental began.\nMorales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp. 2d at 1044-1045 (footnotes\nomitted).4 \nThe recent evidence that has surfaced in California, only\nafter discovery was received, and after Mr. Hill’s case was\nstayed by this Court, supports and corroborates the newly\ndiscovered evidence contained in the Lancet article, upon which\nMr. Hill relied in his § 1983 action. \nIndeed, following the evidence that surfaced after discovery\nwas disclosed about the recent executions in California, a\ndistrict court in Ohio granted a condemned inmate’s request for\n     4Further, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, two doses of\npotassium chloride were required to stop the beating of the\ninmate’s heart. Id. at 1046.  In addition to the execution logs,\nthe district court noted the evidence from the eyewitnesses\n“tending to show that many inmates continue to breathe long after\nthey should have ceased to do so.” Id. at 1045.   \n-11-\n\npreliminary injunction based on a challenge to the chemicals and\nthe amount of chemicals used in the execution procedures in\nOhio.5  The district court stated: \nthis Court would be remiss if it did not take note of\nthe evidence that the district courts in Morales and\nBrown considered.  And that evidence raises grave\nconcerns about whether a condemned inmate would be\nsufficiently anesthetized under Ohio’s lethal-injection\nprotocol prior to and while being executed, especially\nconsidering that the dose of sodium thiopental\nprescribed under Ohio’s lethal-injection protocol (2\ngrams) is less than that prescribed under California’s\nprotocol (5 grams) and that prescribed under North\nCarolina’s protocol (3000 mg).”\nCooey v. Taft, et. al, 430 F.Supp 2d 702 (2006); 2006 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 24496, 13. The district court referenced the execution logs\ndisclosed in Morales, as well as other affidavits and\ninformation. \nIn regards to the evidence submitted in Brown v. Beck, the\nCooey Court also noted the autopsy results that showed the post-\nmortem levels of sodium pentothal being less than what would be\nexpected. Id. at 11-12.  And, again, in Brown, evidence was\nsubmitted from witnesses present at recent executions who had\nseen condemned inmates writhing and convulsing after the\nadministration of the sodium pentothal, which was inconsistent\nwith the notion that the inmates had lost consciousness.\nThus, the information submitted in Brown v. Beck is entirely\n     5Ohio, like Florida, requires two (2) grams of sodium pentothal\nbe administered. Cooey v. Taft, et. al, 430 F.Supp 2d 702 (2006);\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24496, 13. \n-12-\n\nconsistent and supports the recent scientific research published\nin the Lancet article.  \n  In issuing the preliminary injunction in Cooey, the district\ncourt found: “Given the evidence that has begun to emerge calling\nthis and other conclusions by Dr. Dershwitz into question, the\nCourt is persuaded that there is an unacceptable and unnecessary\nrisk that Plaintiff Hill will be irreparably harmed absent the\ninjunction, i.e., that Plaintiff Hill could suffer unnecessary\nand excruciating pain while being executed in violation of his\nEighth Amendment right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual\npunishment.” Id. at 15.  Further, the district court in Cooey\nfound that “[i]n view of the lack of development of the record in\nthis case, this Court does not feel that it is in a position to\navoid the issuance of a preliminary injunction by fashioning a\nremedy by which Ohio could carry out the execution of Plaintiff\nHill within the confines of the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 19.\nAlso, recently in Missouri, an evidentiary hearing was held\nand discovery regarding Missouri’s recent executions was\ndisclosed to Michael Taylor, a condemned inmate challenging the\nlethal injection protocol used in executions.  Information was\nrevealed that showed that “unacceptable” risks existed in\nMissouri’s execution procedures that may cause a condemned inmate\nunconstitutional pain and suffering. Taylor v. Crawford, 2006\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 42949, 22 (June 26, 2006).  That information\n-13-\n\nincluded: 1) no written protocol existed; 2) that the State had\nmisrepresented the amount of sodium thiopental that had been\nadministered in recent executions; five (5) grams was to have\nbeen administered, but only two and a half (2.5) grams were\nactually administered; 3) the doctor overseeing the executions\nwas not an anesthesiologist, but rather a surgeon, who was not\nwell versed in mixing and dissolving the chemicals used in the\nexecution protocol and who believed he could modify the amount of\nchemicals and/or protocol at his discretion; and 4) there is no\nmeans to monitor the anesthetic depth of the condemned during the\nexecution procedure. Id. at 19-21.  \nOf particular note to Mr. Hill’s case is that the district\ncourt in Taylor was concerned that the amount of sodium pentothal\nhad been decreased from five (5) grams to two and a half (2.5)\ngrams, which is still more than the State of Florida intends to\nadminister in Mr. Hill’s execution.  Further, Taylor shows the\nimportance of being provided discovery about execution procedures\nas well as information about recent executions – information to\nwhich Mr. Hill has been completely denied.\nThus, as Mr. Hill explained in his amended § 1983 action,\nsince this Court granted Mr. Hill a stay of execution, new,\ncritical information has surfaced that undermines the theories\nthat originally supported the current lethal injection protocols\nused in states, including Florida.  This new information\n-14-\n\ndemonstrates the flaws in Florida’s current lethal injection\nprotocols and at a minimum supports Mr. Hill’s claim that under\nthe current Florida lethal injection protocol he will suffer\nunnecessary and excruciating pain while being executed in\nviolation of his Eighth Amendment right not to be subjected to\ncruel and unusual punishment. \nTHE FEDERAL COURTS’ RULINGS\nThe district court granted the State of Florida’s amended\nmotion to dismiss, declined to issue a stay of execution, and\ndismissed Mr. Hill’s Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory\nand Injunctive Relief. See Hill v. McDonough, Case No. 4:06-cv-\n032-SPM, (N.D. Fla. 2006) . The district court then denied Mr.\nHill’s motion for reconsideration and motion for stay. See Hill\nv. McDonough,  Case No. 4:06-cv-032-SPM, Doc. 47.\nIn denying Mr. Hill’s motion for a stay of execution and for\nexpedited appeal, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the\nequities did not support Hill’s request:\nSimply put, Hill was the architect of the very trap\nfrom which he now seeks relief.  At the outset, Hill\nfiled his § 1983 complaint four days before his\npreviously scheduled execution date of January 24,\n2006, and just after the Florida Supreme Court rejected\nhis application for post-conviction relief on, among\nother grounds, his challenge to the Florida lethal\ninjection protocol.  See Hill v. State, 921 So. 2d 579,\n582–83 (Fla. 2006).  Hill’s assertion of essentially\nthe same lethal injection challenge in the Florida\ncourts reveals that he was aware of the grounds for the\nclaim much earlier than the date on which he actually\nfiled his § 1983 action in federal district court.  But\nwe need not rely on that inference alone to determine\n-15-\n\nthat Hill unreasonably delayed in filing his federal\ncomplaint.  The Florida Supreme Court considered a\nchallenge to the Florida lethal injection protocols on\nsimilar grounds as early as 2000.  Sims v. State, 754\nSo. 2d 657, 666–68 (Fla. 2000).6  Although it is\nunclear from the procedural history whether Hill\naddressed the Sims precedent in his post-conviction\nproceedings after 2000, the fact remains that, during\nthe pendency of his various collateral challenges,\nFlorida had considered the same type of claim upon\nwhich Hill now seeks relief.  In light of this context,\nHill cannot claim that it was impossible for him to\ninitiate his federal suit any earlier.\nFurther, with regard to more recent procedural\nhistory, Hill has again demonstrated his intent to\ndelay proceedings in order to necessitate a stay. \nAfter the district court denied his request for\ninjunctive relief and dismissed his complaint, Hill\nmoved for reconsideration and, again, for a stay of\nexecution.  The district court denied his motions on\nSeptember 11, 2006, noting that “Hill’s emotionally-\nladen arguments raise no new evidence. . . . [I]t\nappears that Hill is engaging in dilatory tactics to\ndelay a death sentence.”  Order Denying Motion for\nReconsideration and Motion for Stay at 2–3, Hill v.\nMcDonough, No. 4:06-CV-032-SPM (N.D. Fla. Sept. 11,\n2006).   By moving for reconsideration, Hill only\nfurther delayed this court’s receipt of his case on\nappeal, bringing us within days of his scheduled\nexecution before he filed the instant motion for a stay\nand expedited appeal.\nIn light of Hill’s actions in this case, which can\nonly be described as dilatory, we join our sister\ncircuits in declining to allow further litigation of a\n§ 1983 case filed essentially on the eve of execution. \nSee White v. Johnson, 429 F.3d 572, 573–74 (5th Cir.\n2005) (holding that even if the condemned inmate’s §\n1983 action was cognizable, “‘he is not entitled to the\nequitable relief he seeks’ due to his dilatory filing”\n(citations omitted)); Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414,\n417–18 (5th Cir. 2004) (condemned inmate who filed §\n1983 action ten weeks before his scheduled execution\n“leaves little doubt that the real purpose behind his\n     6 The Florida Supreme Court relied on Sims in rejecting Hill’s\nlethal injection challenge during post-conviction proceedings.  \nHill v. State, 921 So. 2d at 582–83.\n-16-\n\nclaim is to seek a delay of his execution, not merely\nto effect an alteration of the manner in which it is\ncarried out”); see generally Hicks v. Taft, 431 F.3d\n916 (6th Cir. 2005); Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029\n(9th Cir. 2004).  This holding is consistent with the\nSupreme Court’s instruction in its remand of Hill’s\ncase that “[a] court considering a stay must also apply\n‘a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a\nstay where a claim could have been brought at such time\nas to allow consideration of the merits without\nrequiring entry of a stay.’” Hill v. McDonough, 547\nU.S. at ---, 126 S. Ct. at 2104 (citation omitted).\nHill v. McDonough, Case No. 06-14927 at 6-9.\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT  \nTHIS COURT SHOULD REVIEW THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE FEDERAL\nCOURTS’ CONSIDERATION OF EQUITIES IN DENYING MR. HILL A\nSTAY OF EXECUTION AND A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.\nA. Equities consideration after remand\nIn Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (2006), this Court\nheld that Mr. Hill’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was\nessentially comparable to that brought in Nelson v. Campbell,\n124 S.Ct. 2117 (2004), and that Mr. Hill should be allowed to\nproceed under § 1983. \nThis Court also noted that a stay of execution is an\nequitable remedy and “[t]hus, like other stay applicants, inmates\nseeking time to challenge the manner in which the State plans to\nexecute them must satisfy all of the requirements for a stay,\nincluding a showing of a significant possibility of success on\nthe merits.” Hill, 126 S.Ct. at 2104.  “A court considering a\nstay must also apply ‘a strong equitable presumption against the\ngrant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a\n-17-\n\ntime as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring\nentry of a stay.’” Id. (citations omitted). \nIn denying Mr. Hill’s requested relief, the Eleventh\nCircuit determined that Hill was dilatory by filing his original\n§ 1983 complaint four days before his execution and by filing a\nmotion for reconsideration after the denial of his amended\ncomplaint. Hill v. McDonough, Case No. 06-14927 at 6, 8.  The\nEleventh Circuit concluded that “In light of Hill’s actions in\nthis case, which can only be described as dilatory, we join our\nsister circuits in declining to allow further litigation of a §\n1983 case filed essentially on the eve of execution.” Id. at 8\n(citations omitted). \nIn making this determination, the Eleventh Circuit ignores\nthe fact that it “was the architect of the very trap from which\n[Hill][] now seeks relief.” When Mr. Hill’s case was remanded by\nthis Court after its decision in Hill v. McDonough, Mr. Hill’s\nexecution was no longer imminent.  This change in circumstances,\nnot only changed the equities, it rendered an analysis of the\nequities moot because the equities are to be considered in\ndetermining whether to grant equitable relief, i.e. a stay of\nexecution, not in deciding the merits of a § 1983 action. See\nNelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649 (2004)(“the mere fact that\nan inmate states a cognizable § 1983 claim does not warrant the\nentry of a stay as a matter of right”); Gomez v. United States\n-18-\n\nDist. Court of the Norther Dist. of Cal., 503 U.S. 653, 654\n(1992)(“A court may consider the last minute nature of an\napplication to stay an execution whether to grant equitable\nrelief.”).\n As this Court made clear in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S.\n637, 649 (2004), Gomez governed the standard for determining\nwhether a §1983 plaintiff was entitled to a stay of execution\nduring the pendency of the lawsuit.  This Court explained, “the\nmere fact that an inmate states a cognizable §1983 claim does\nnot warrant the entry of a stay as a matter of right.”  As to\nthe entitlement to a stay, the Supreme Court in Nelson quoted\nits earlier opinion in Gomez, 503 U.S. at 654: \nThis claim could have been brought more than a decade\nago.  There is no good reason for this abusive delay,\nwhich has been compounded by last-minute attempts to\nmanipulate the judicial process.  A court may consider\nthe last-minute nature of an application to stay\nexecution in deciding whether to grant equitable\nrelief. \nHowever, since there was no scheduled execution at the time\nof remand in Mr. Hill’s case, Gomez was inapplicable. \nUltimately, Mr. Hill was not permitted to proceed on his § 1983\naction without a looming execution date solely because of the\nactions by the State and the court.  Despite this Court’s remand\non July 14, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit failed to take any action\non Mr. Hill’s case.  Thirty days passed without any instruction\nfrom the Eleventh Circuit and, significantly, without any\n-19-\n\nexecution date having been scheduled by the State of Florida. \nThen, in an apparent response to the inaction by the Eleventh\nCircuit, on August 17, 2006 Florida’s Governor reset Mr. Hill’s\nexecution date for Wednesday, September 20, 2006. See Appendix\nC, Letter from Attorney General Charlie Crist to Governor Bush\ndated August 17, 2006.\nDespite the action by the Governor, the Eleventh Circuit\nstill refrained from remanding Mr. Hill’s case back to the\ndistrict court for consideration of his § 1983 action. Only\nafter Mr. Hill filed a motion for immediate remand did the\ncircuit court remand this cause on August 29, 2006. See Hill v.\nMcDonough, No. 06-10621 (11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006).7   \nClearly, the scheduling of Mr. Hill’s execution was enacted\nin order to obtain a strategic advantage in the § 1983\nproceedings, to change the balance of equities.  This was done\nto preclude judicial resolution and violated Mr. Hill’s right to\ndue process.  The guarantee that no person shall be deprived of\nlife, liberty or property without due process of law is a\nfundamental constitutional right that applies to both federal\nand state governmental actors through the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution.8 Here, Mr. Hill should not\n     7 The mandate issued on Thursday, August 31, 2006. \n     8 The Due Process Clause applies to federal courts, Dusenberry\nv.

V.\n-20-\n\nbe penalized because the lower court and the State forced him to\nproceed on his § 1983 “on the eve” of execution. \nB. Equities have been changed by circumstances\nIn faulting Mr. Hill for not raising his original § 1983\naction at an earlier time, the Eleventh Circuit fails to\nacknowledge that prior to Hill v. McDonough, Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent refused to recognize and thereby notice condemned\nprisoners that a §1983 action could be used to challenge\n“[m]ethod of execution” under the Eighth Amendment.  In fact,\nthe Eleventh Circuit had consistently ruled that Mr. Hill, and\nothers on Florida’s death row, “could [not] have brought” the\nclaim contained in the pending §1983 action.  As well, the\ncourt’s clear holding in Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F.3d 1281, 1284\n(11th Cir. 2004), precluded such a lawsuit.  Indeed, the district\ncourt originally dismissed Mr. Hill’s claim based upon that\nprecedent.  It was only on January 24, 2006 – when this Court\ngranted certiorari review in Hill v. Crosby to determine whether\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s determination that district courts lack\nOberg, 512 U.S. 415, 430-435 (1994).  It has been long\nestablished that “[a]n elementary and fundamental requirement of\ndue process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is\nnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to\napprise the interested parties of the pendency of the action and\nto afford them an opportunity” to present their case.  Mullane v.\nCentral Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950). \n-21-\n\njurisdiction to consider claims like Mr. Hill’s was correct –\nthat the validity of this precedent was called into question.\nPrior Eleventh Circuit precedent was succinctly explained\nin Hill v. Crosby:\nIt is clear to us that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to consider appellant’s claim because it\nis the functional equivalent of a successive habeas\npetition and he failed to obtain leave of this court to\nfile it.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A).  And as the\npanel observed in Robinson, “such an application to\nfile a successive petition would be due to be denied in\nany event.  See In re Provanzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1235-\n36 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1256, 120\nS.Ct. 2710, 147 L.Ed.2d 979 (2000) (concluding that a\nclaim that lethal injection constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment does not meet the requirements of 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) or (B)).”\n437 F.3d 1084, 1085 (11th Cir. 2006).\nThus, unlike the situation in the bevy of cases cited by\nthe district court9, the Eleventh Circuit10, or even in Gomez v.\nU.S. Dist. Ct. For N. Dist. Cal. 503 U.S. 653, (1992)(per\ncuriam), there is “good reason” in this case for the failure to\npresent this claim previously.  According to the binding\nprecedent of the Eleventh Circuit when the Lancet study came out\n     9 Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 2004); White v.\nJohnson, 429 F.3d 572, 574 (5th Cir. 2005); White v. Livingston,\n126 S.Ct. 601 (2005); Patton v. Jones, 2006 WL 2468312 (10th Cir.\nAug. 25, 2006); Reese v. Livingston, 453 F.3d 289, 291 (5th Cir.\nJune 20, 2006). \n     10 White v. Johnson, 429 F.3d 572, 573-74 (5th Cir. 2005); Harris\nv. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 417-18 (5th Cir. 2004); Hicks v. Taft,\n431 F.3d 916 (6th Cir. 2005); Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029 (9th\nCir. 2004).\n-22-\n\nin April of 2005, Mr. Hill could file neither a successive\nhabeas petition challenging the protocol employed by the State\nof Florida for carrying out a lethal injection execution, nor a\n§1983 complaint. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is incorrect in asserting that Mr.\nHill could have brought his claim in the years preceding the\ndate his execution was scheduled.  Not only did the court’s\nbinding case law preclude it, Mr. Hill’s challenge could not\nhave become ripe before his death warrant issued, because it was\nonly at that time that the Florida Department of Corrections\n(“DOC”) was obliged to begin planning to conduct his execution,\nand only at that point that Mr. Hill could attempt to ascertain\nthe specific means by which the State meant to carry out his\nlethal injection. See Worthington v. Missouri, 166 S.W. 3d 566,\n583 n.3 (Mo. 2005).11  That is the case in Florida because the\nDOC retains complete discretion over how lethal injections will\n     11As Justice Breyer stated in his questioning of the State of\nFlorida during oral argument in this cause: \nAnd so [Mr. Hill] thinks, up until the last minute,\nthat maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold,\nwhen the death warrant is actually executed, it now\nbegins to appear that they won't.  And therefore, at\nthat time, he brings the case.  Now, I've spun out a\nstory which seems probable, that if it's true, it would\nbe very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the\nexecution warrant is issued and thereafter it is.\nHill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (2006), Oral Argument\ntranscript at 29.\n-23-\n\nbe carried out, and it shrouds its intentions in secrecy.  \nNo Florida statute provides the chemical sequence to be\nused, the procedures for administering it, any qualifications or\ntraining required for persons engaged in administering the\nchemicals and monitoring the execution, or the means of venous\naccess.  Nor does any Florida statute even require that such\nprocedures be devised through rule-making process, or in\nconsultation with medical experts.  Compare Fla. Stat. § \n828.055 (requiring Board of Pharmacy to adopt rules for the\nissuance of permits authorizing the use of chemicals in animal\neuthanasia, which “shall set forth guidelines for the proper\nstorage and handling” of the chemicals); 828.058 (requiring\ntraining for animal euthanasia technicians involving a\ncurriculum approved by the Board of Veterinary Medicine).  And\nthe Department has not itself decided to publish any definitive\nset of procedures through rule-making or otherwise.  DOC,\ntherefore, retains total discretion to change the chemical\nsequence, the manner of administration, the qualifications and\ntraining of the execution team, and any safeguards to ensure\nproper administration and adequate anesthetic depth at any time\nand with respect to any particular execution. The State has\nnever disputed that DOC has total discretion in this regard. The\n“central concern” of the ripeness doctrine “is whether the case\ninvolves uncertain or contingent future events that may not\n-24-\n\noccur as anticipated.”  Charles Alan Wright et al., 13A Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3532, at 112.      \nHere, rather than promulgate a definitive policy, DOC has\nretained total discretion over its process of lethal injection. \nFor this reason, it was only when Mr. Hill’s execution was\nimminent that he could ascertain what execution procedures would\nbe applied to him.  The State cannot fight tooth and nail to\nresist publication of any definitive protocol12, and then accuse\nthe condemned person of inequitable conduct because he must wait\nuntil his death warrant is issued to ascertain the particular\nprocedures that will be used in his execution.13     \nGiven the lack of any constraints on DOC’s discretion and\nof any definitive practices that would have provided the courts\nwith a sufficiently concrete policy to review, Mr. Hill’s claim\ndid not ripen until the execution warrant issued.  From the\nmoment that Mr. Hill’s challenge ripened, he has diligently\npursued his claim.  Mr. Hill initially filed suit in state\n     12 The State of Florida has denied Mr. Hill any access\nwhatsoever to records, policies, procedures, or any other\ninformation concerning its lethal injection protocols and\nprocedures.\n     13 Instead, the State can secure an earlier disposition of such\nsuits simply by prescribing definitive practices or the orderly\nadoption of rules, as it already has done to regulate animal\neuthanasia.  The Department, moreover, need only implement the\nfamiliar process of agency rule-making to ensure that the \nquestion whether its chosen procedures for administering lethal\ninjection violates the Eighth Amendment ripens before the\ninmate’s date of execution is set. \n-25-\n\ncourt, in order to defend against an argument that he had failed\nto exhaust state remedies.14  As soon as his action was dismissed\non procedural grounds in state court, he filed his § 1983\naction. The aforementioned facts establish that Mr. Hill was\ndiligent in filing his §1983 claim.  Unfortunately, the district\ncourt’s order nor the Eleventh Circuit’s order acknowledge or\nspecifically consider the facts presented.\nOf further note is that the study relied upon by Mr. Hill\nwas not published until April 2005, five years after the Sims\ndecision.  This study is new.  It is post-Sims.15  In addition,\nTaylor and Morales are recent decisions which demonstrate\nexamples of how reality vastly differs from theory when\ngrappling with lethal injection issues.  The discovery in these\ncases exposed the Missouri and California procedures to be much\nmore inadequate than ever imagined.  As none of this information\nwas available at the time Sims was decided, certainly Mr. Hill\n14 Although Mr. Hill was not required to exhaust state-court\nremedies  prior  to  bringing  his  federal-court  action  under\n§ 1983,  see Wilkinson v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 1249 (2005),\nhe did so out of an abundance of caution, recognizing that if\nthe district court were to construe his complaint as a habeas\nfiling in accord with Eleventh Circuit precedent, he would have\nhad  to  exhaust  those  judicial  remedies,  see  48  U.S.C.\n§ 2254(b)(1)(A).\n     15 Mr. Hill’s claim is no different than in cases where new\nscientific DNA techniques were developed after those cases had\nconcluded.  Just as in those cases where courts are reconsidering\nprior rulings in light of subsequent scientific research, so\nshould Mr. Hill’s claim be considered in light of new scientific\nevidence.\n-26-\n\ncannot be faulted for failing to raise the issue.\nC. Merits review in equities consideration   \nSince the stay in Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 163\nL.Ed.2d 1144, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 1074 (January 25, 2006),the\noutcome of §1983 lethal injection around the country has been\nrandom and arbitrary. Condemned inmates in similar positions to\nMr. Hill have been permitted stays of execution, and some have\nbeen allowed to pursue litigation in order to have the merits of\ntheir claim reviewed. In other circuits, however, inmates with\nthe exact same constitutional challenge have been executed\nwithout consideration of their claims, despite the fact that\nsuch an analysis is required in order to assess the equities\ninvolved in granting a stay and/or a temporary injunction.\nThe disparity in the circuits’ approach to lethal injection\nchallenges is widespread and striking. Executions have been put\non hold pending extensive hearings on the lethal injection issue\nin California. See Morales v. Hickman, Case No. C06-219-JF &\nC06-926-JF-RS (N.D. Cal. 2006). Similarly, in Missouri, a\nfederal district judge has ordered a new lethal injection\nprotocol and halted executions in that state until at least\nOctober 27, 2006. Taylor v. Crawford, Case No. 2:05-cv-04173-FJG\n(W.D. Mo.), Docs. 195, 213. Federal judges in Arkansas and\nDelaware also halted executions in those states. Nooner et al.\nV. Norris, et al., Case No. 5:06-cv-110 (E.D. Ark.); see also\n-27-\n\nTerrick Nooner v. Larry Davis, et al., Case No. 06-2748, (8th\nCir.).  In South Dakota, the governor halted an execution at the\nlast minute amid concerns regarding the state’s lethal injection\nprocedure and asked the state legislature to amend the statute\non lethal injections.\nLikewise, in Oklahoma, the state voluntarily changed its\nexecution protocol in response to the litigation in Patton v.\nJones, Case No. CIV-06-591-F (W.D. Okla.), which exposed serious\nproblems inherent in that state’s procedures.16 Similarly, North\nCarolina revised their lethal injection procedures in response\nto a §1983 challenge. See Brown v. Beck, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n60084 (E.D. N.C. 2006). \nYet despite the recognition by numerous states and circuits\nthat lethal injection procedures merit review, executions have\nproceeded in other states - - states which have lethal injection\nprotocols substantially similar, if not exactly the same, as\nstates which have halted their executions. Texas, for example,\nhas executed 21 people this year by lethal injection, fully half\nof all the executions in the country for 2006.\nwww.deathpenaltyinfo.org (site last visited September 17, 2006).\nAs one judge in a Tennessee capital case cogently observed\nregarding the wide disparity and arbitrary nature of court\n     16 Significantly, Florida’s lethal injection procedure was\nmodeled upon Oklahoma’s, which was altered in response to the\nlethal injection challenge in Patton. Id. \n-28-\n\nresponses to lethal injection challenges and their\narbitrariness:\n[T]he dysfunctional patchwork of stays and executions\ngoing on in this country further undermines the various\nstates’ effectiveness and ability to properly carry out\ndeath sentences. We are currently operating under a\nsystem wherein condemned inmates are bringing near\nidentical challenges to the lethal injection procedure.\nIn some instances stays are granted, while in others\nthey are not and the defendants are executed, with no\nprincipled distinction to justify such a result. \nAlley v. Little, No. 06-5650 (6th Cir. May 16,\n2006)(Martin, J., dissenting from denial of a rehearing\nen banc)(emphasis added).\nA review of lethal injection litigation around the country\ndemonstrates that courts have developed essentially two methods\nto  handle lethal injection claims. One approach, utilized by the\nFourth, Fifth, and (now) Eleventh Circuits, is to deny both the\nclaim and the stay based upon dilatoriness, without any\nexamination of the merits in assessing the equities involved.\n(See, e.g., White v. Johnson, 429 F.3d 572, 573-74 (5th Cir.\n2005); Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 417-18 (5th Cir. 2004),\nand Hill v. McDonough, Case No. 06-14927 (2006)). The second\nmethod, which has been used in the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth\nCircuits, is that a stay is denied, but the case is not\ndismissed. Rather, the case is permitted to proceed on a fast-\ntrack basis, and if the plaintiff develops enough evidence, a\nstay is then granted. Patton v. Jones, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n54429 (Okla. W.D. Aug. 4, 2006) affirmed, stay denied, Patton v.\n-29-\n\nJones, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 22312 (10th Cir. Aug. 25, 2006),\nPatton v. Jones, petition denied, stay denied, 2006 U.S. LEXIS\n5379 (Aug.29, 2006);  Morales v. Hickman,  2006 WL 335427 (N.D.\nCal., Feb. 14, 2006) reviewed at Morales v. Hickman, 2006 WL\n391604 (9th Cir., 2006); Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097-\n98 (8th Cir. 2006) on remand, Taylor v. Crawford, 2006 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 42949, 22 (June 26, 2006).17  Thus, in Patton, Morales, and\nTaylor, a determination on the merits was made in a very limited\namount of time, and enough discovery and testimony were adduced\nto allow meaningful consideration to be given to the plaintiffs’\nclaims. Clearly, these cases demonstrate that it is possible to\nlitigate and resolve lethal injection issues quickly.18 \nYet there is no doubt that with an issue as grave and\nweighty as lethal injection, the courts should permit thorough\nand meaningful litigation. The procedural history in Mr. Taylor’s\ncase is instructive as to the perils of attempting to litigate\nlethal injection claims at a moment’s notice when a state\n     17 For example, the docket sheet in Patton reveals that the\nplaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction on July 28,\n2006, and a hearing on that motion was held on August 8, 2006. \nAt the hearing, the State of Oklahoma introduced a new protocol\nin response to plaintiff’s claims, and the Court ruled that the\nprotocol extant at the time the lawsuit was filed was\nunconstitutional; however, the new protocol was ruled to have\nsufficiently addressed plaintiff’s concerns regarding the\nconstitutionality of the method of execution.  See Patton v.\nJones, Case No. 5:06-cv-00591-F, Docket Report & Doc. 25.\n     18It was incorrect for the district court and the Eleventh\nCircuit to assume that the parties could not address Mr. Hill’s\nclaims prior to his September 20, 2006 execution date. \n-30-\n\narbitrarily sets an execution date to gain an advantage in a\n§1983 lethal injection case. During the pendency of Mr. Taylor’s\nlethal injection challenge the State of Missouri arbitrarily set\nan execution date on January 3, 2006 for February 1, 2006. See\nTaylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006).  The\ndistrict court then stayed the execution and set an evidentiary\nhearing on Mr. Taylor’s claims for February 21, 2006. The\ndistrict court’s stated reason for the stay was that it could not\naccommodate a hearing in Mr. Taylor’s case prior to February 21,\n2006 due to its full calendar. Id. \nThe State of Missouri appealed the issuance of a stay and\nthe Eighth Circuit vacated the stay and remanded to the district\ncourt on January 29, 2006 with instructions to assign a district\ncourt judge that could immediately hold a hearing and issue a\nruling prior to the scheduled February 1, 2006 execution. See\nOrder, No. 06-1278. Eighth Cir. Jan. 29, 2006; see also Taylor v.\nCrawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097-98 (8th Cir. 2006).  \nOn remand the district court judge immediately conducted a\nhearing on January 30 and 31, 2006, while making it clear the\nhearing would be conducted in accord with the Eighth Circuit’s\ntimeline. Id. at 1098. Taylor was unable to conduct any further\ndiscovery and unable to procure the attendance of indispensable\nwitnesses due to the untenable time constraints. Id. “Taylor\nimmediately appealed the district court’s adverse order,\n-31-\n\nasserting that “the expedited and truncated hearing before the\ndistrict court denied him due process” and that it was erroneous\nfor the court to preclude him from calling necessary witnesses\nand to deny his claim on the merits. Id. He also moved for a\nstay, which the panel denied. See id. \nThe same day he filed his appeal, an en banc panel granted\nTaylor’s request for a stay and his motion for rehearing, and\nreturned the case to the panel for briefing and oral argument.\nSee id. The panel’s observation after briefing and oral argument\nis enlightening:\nHaving reviewed the record made before the\ndistrict court, we now realize the burdensome\nstrain that our order imposed upon the district\ncourt as well as upon the parties as they made\nextraordinary efforts to comply. We herby offer\nour mea culpa . . . We simply asked the district\ncourt and the parties to do too much in too little\ntime. \nId. at 1099.\nAfter remand, Mr. Taylor was able to engage in meaningful\ndiscovery that exposed serious flaws in Missouri’s execution\nprocedures resulting in the district court judge ruling their\nsystem unconstitutional.19 \nUnfortunately for Mr. Hill, despite this Court’s ruling in\nHill v. McDonough, despite Eleventh Circuit precedent which\n     19 The cruel irony is that due to Mr. Hill’s geographical\nlocation, depending upon the outcome of these proceedings, he may\nbe executed pursuant to a lethal injection procedure strikingly\nsimilar to Missouri’s.\n-32-\n\nprecluded him from litigating his claim before Hill, and despite\nhis timely and good faith efforts to pursue his §1983 claim, he\nwas never given the opportunity for any kind of discovery or\nevidentiary hearing whatsoever.  The merits of his claim were\nnever examined in any meaningful capacity. \nThe procedural history of Mr. Hill’s § 1983 challenge has\nplaced the Eleventh Circuit squarely in conflict with the Sixth,\nEighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. This conflict, and the\narbitrary disparity around the country which seemingly depends\nupon nothing but geography, now unconstitutionally imperils Mr.\nHill’s life. Mr. Hill should have been allowed to pursue\ndiscovery and present evidence in support of his claim and\nreceive a judicial resolution on the merits. Instead, at this\npoint this litigation is no further along than when this Court\ngranted certiorari on January 25, 2006. It is difficult to\nbelieve that is the outcome this Court contemplated when it\ndecided Hill v. McDonough this past June.\nCONCLUSION\nPetitioner, Clarence Edward Hill, requests that certiorari\nreview be granted.\n-33-\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n /s/ D. Todd Doss       \nD.

Crosby, Case No. 06-10621 (11th\nCir. January 24, 2006), and is attached to this petition as\nAppendix A.  The decision of the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Florida, Tallahassee Division appears as\nHill v. State, Case No. 4:06-cv-032-SPM, and is attached to this\npetition as Appendix B.  \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\nPetitioner invokes this Court’s jurisdiction to grant the\nPetition for a Writ of Certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit Court\nof Appeals on the basis of 28 U.S.C. Section 1257.  The Eleventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion denying relief on\nJanuary 24, 2006.\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\n[N]or [shall] cruel and unusual punishments [be] inflicted. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VIII.\nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life [or]\nliberty . . . without due process of law; nor deny to\nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\nof the laws.  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. \nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\nor Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects or\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\nto the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall\nbe liable to the party injured in an action at law,\nsuit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. \n42 U.S.C.  § 1983 \n2\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn November 2, 1982, Mr. Hill was indicted and charged with\none count of first degree murder, one count of attempted first\ndegree murder, three counts of armed robbery, and possession of a\nfirearm during the commission of a felony. (R. 1440-41). \nFollowing a trial which commenced on April 27, 1983, the jury\nfound Mr. Hill guilty of all the crimes charged. (R. 1662). \nSubsequently, the jury rendered an advisory sentence recommending\ndeath by a vote of ten to two, which the trial court imposed. (R.\n1665, 1668-9).\nMr. Hill appealed his conviction to the Florida Supreme\nCourt, which found that the trial court erred in denying Mr.\nHill’s challenge of a juror who was not impartial in his state of\nmind.  The Court remanded the case for a new penalty phase with a\nnew jury. Hill v. State, 477 So. 2d 553 (Fla. 1985).  \nMr. Hill’s new penalty phase was held on March 24, 1986.  By\na vote of eleven to one, the jury issued an advisory opinion for\nMr. Hill’s death on March 27, 1986.  The circuit court\nsentenced Mr. Hill to death on April 2, 1986. (RS. 835). \nMr. Hill filed an appeal with the Florida Supreme Court,\nwhich affirmed his sentences.  Hill v. State, 515 So.2d 176 (Fla.\n1987). Mr. Hill then filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\nbefore this Court, which was denied.  Hill v. State, 108 S.Ct.\n1302 (1988).  \n3\n\nOn November 9, 1989, the Governor of Florida signed a death\nwarrant scheduling Mr. Hill’s execution for January 25, 1990.   \nMr. Hill’s counsel filed an expedited Motion to Vacate Judgments\nof Convictions and Sentences with Special Emergency Request for\nLeave to Amend on December 11, 1989. (PCR. 1-128).  On January\n18, 1990, the circuit court refused to grant Mr. Hill an\nevidentiary hearing and summarily denied Mr. Hill’s motion. \nOn January 22, 1990, Mr. Hill appealed the order from the\ncircuit court. (PCR. 387).  Mr. Hill also filed a habeas corpus\npetition with the Florida Supreme Court.  On January 26, 1990,\nthe Florida Supreme Court denied all relief. Hill v. State, 556\nSo. 2d 1385 (Fla. 1990).1 \nMr. Hill subsequently filed a Motion to Stay Execution and a\nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Florida on January 27, 1990. \nThe district court granted a stay on January 28, 1990.  On August\n31, 1992, the district court granted relief to Mr. Hill on the\ngrounds that the circuit court and the Florida Supreme Court\nfailed to conduct a proper harmless error test when re-weighing\nthe aggravating factors after eliminating the cold, calculating,\nand premeditating aggravator.  Furthermore, the trial judge\nfailed to find certain nonstatutory mitigating facts even though\n     1Mr. Hill’s execution was rescheduled for Monday, January\n29, 1990 at 7:01 a.m.  \n4\n\nmitigation was established by the record.  The district court\nmade no recommendation as to whether a new sentencing hearing had\nto be conducted.    \nUpon remand, Mr. Hill filed a motion to reopen his direct\nappeal to address the issues cited by the United States District\nCourt.  The Florida Supreme Court granted the motion, but upon\nre-weighing the four remaining aggravating factors against the\none statutory mitigating circumstance of Mr. Hill’s age and\nseveral non-statutory mitigating factors that were not previously\nconsidered, the court resentenced Mr. Hill to death. Hill v.\nState, 643 So. 2d 1071 (Fla. 1995).  \nMr. Hill then filed an amended habeas corpus petition before\nthe United States District Court challenging the decision of the\nFlorida Supreme Court. The district court denied relief on the\ngrounds that the Florida Supreme Court satisfied the dictates of\nParker v. Dugger, 498 U.S. 308 (1991).  Mr. Hill appealed this\ndecision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which found\nthat the district court had correctly decided Mr. Hill’s claims.\nHill v. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999).  Mr. Hill\nsubsequently filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before this\nCourt, which was denied.  See Hill v. State, 528 U.S. 1087\n(2000).  \nMr. Hill filed a successive Rule 3.850 motion in state court\non June 20, 2003 pursuant to Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584\n5\n\n(2002).  The circuit court denied said motion on May 26, 2004,\nand denied the motion for rehearing on June 21, 2004.  Mr. Hill\ntimely filed his appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, which was\ndenied on May 13, 2005. \nOn November 29, 2005, Governor Jeb Bush signed a death\nwarrant setting an execution date of January 24, 2006 at 6:00\np.m.  Mr. Hill filed a successive 3.850 motion on December 15,\n2005.  Following a case management conference on December 19,\n2005, the lower court orally denied Mr. Hill an evidentiary\nhearing on his claims for relief.  A written order was issued on\nDecember 23, 2005.   \nOn December 31, 2005, Mr. Hill filed a notice of appeal of\nthe order from the circuit court. (PCR. 387).  On January 17,\n2006, the Florida Supreme Court denied all relief. Hill v. State,\n2006 Fla. LEXIS 8 (January 17, 2006).  On January 20, 2005, Mr.\nHill filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari before this Court. \nOn Friday, January 20, 2006, Mr. Hill brought an action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Florida, Tallahassee Division.  Mr. Hill\nalleged violations of his right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution.  On Saturday, January 21, 2006, the\ndistrict court dismissed Mr. Hill’s complaint for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for lack of jurisdiction.  \n6\n\nOn Monday, January 23, 2006, Mr. Hill filed a Notice of\nAppeal.  On that same date, Mr. Hill filed in the Eleventh\nCircuit an Application for a Stay of Execution and for Expedited\nAppeal.  The Eleventh Circuit denied Mr. Hill’s Application on\nJanuary 24, 2006.\nFACTS RELEVANT TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED\nIn his complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the\nUnited States District Court, Mr. Hill asserted that the\ndefendants, acting under color of Florida law, are using a\nsuccession of three chemicals that will cause unnecessary pain in\nthe execution of a sentence of death, which they have admitted to\nbe their practice, which is unnecessary as a means of employing\nlethal injection, and which creates a foreseeable risk of\ninflicting unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain contrary to\ncontemporary standards of decency.\nMr. Hill’s claim was premised upon a recent study published\nin the world-renowned medical journal THE LANCET by Dr. David A.\nLubarsky (whose declaration was attached to Mr. Hill’s Complaint)\nand three co-authors who detailed the results of their research\non the effects of chemicals in lethal injections.  See Koniaris\nL.G., Zimmers T.A., Lubarski D.A., Sheldon J.P., Inadequate\nanaesthesia in lethal injection for execution, Vol 365, THE\nLANCET 1412-14 (April 16, 2005).  This study confirmed, through\nthe analysis of empirical after-the-fact data, that the\n7\n\nscientific critique of the use of sodium pentothal, pancuronium\nbromide, and potassium chloride creates a foreseeable risk of the\ngratuitous and unnecessary infliction of pain on a person being\nexecuted.2  The authors found that in toxicology reports in the\ncases they studied, post-mortem concentrations of thiopental in\nthe blood were lower than that required for surgery in 43 of 49\nexecuted inmates (88%).  Moreover, 21 of the 49 executed inmates\n(43%) had concentrations consistent with awareness, as the\ninmates had an inadequate amount of sodium pentothal in their\nbloodstream to provide anesthesia. (Complaint, Att. B).  In other\nwords, in close to half of the cases, the prisoner felt the\nsuffering of suffocation from pancuronium bromide, and the\nburning through the veins followed by the heart attack caused by\nthe potassium chloride.\nAs explained in the declaration of Dr. Lubarsky, sodium\npentothal is an ultra-short acting substance which produces\nshallow anesthesia. (Complaint, Att. A).  Health-care\nprofessionals use it as an initial anesthetic in preparation for\nsurgery while they set up a breathing tube in the patient and use\ndifferent drugs to bring the to patient to a “surgical plane” of\nanesthesia that will last through the operation and will block\nthe stimuli of surgery which would otherwise cause pain. Sodium\n     2Dr. Lubarski has noted that each of the opinions set forth\nin the Lancet study reflects his opinion to a reasonable degree\nof scientific certainty. (Complaint, Att. A).\n8\n\npentothal is intended to be defeasible by stimuli associated with\nerrors in setting up the breathing tube and initiating the\nlong-run, deep anesthesia; the patient is supposed to be able to\nwake up and signal the staff that something is wrong.\nThe second chemical used in lethal injections in Florida is\npancuronium bromide, sometimes referred to simply as pancuronium.\nIt is not an anesthetic. It is a paralytic agent, which stops the\nbreathing. It has two contradictory effects: first, it causes the\nperson to whom it is applied to suffer suffocation when the lungs\nstop moving; second, it prevents the person from manifesting this\nsuffering, or any other sensation, by facial expression, hand\nmovement, or speech. (Complaint, Att. A).  Pancuronium bromide is\nunnecessary to bring about the death of a person being executed\nby lethal injection. (Complaint, Att. A).\nThe third chemical is potassium chloride, which is the\nsubstance that causes the death of the prisoner.  It burns\nintensely as it courses through the veins toward the heart.  It\nalso causes massive muscle cramping before causing cardiac\narrest. (Complaint, Att. A).  When the potassium chloride reaches\nthe heart, it causes a heart attack.  If the anesthesia has worn\noff by that time, the condemned feels the pain of a heart attack. \nHowever, in this case, Mr. Hill will be unable to communicate his\npain because the pancuronium bromide has paralyzed his face, his\n9\n\narms, and his entire body so that he cannot express himself\neither verbally or otherwise. (Complaint, Att. A).\nAs explained by Dr. Lubarsky, because Florida’s practices\nare substantially similar to those of the lethal-injection\njurisdictions which conducted autopsies and toxicology reports,\nwhich kept records of them, and which disclosed them to the\nLANCET scholars, there is at least the same risk (43%) as in\nthose jurisdictions that Mr. Hill will not be anesthetized at the\ntime of his death. (Complaint, Att. A). \n  THE FEDERAL COURTS’ RULINGS\nIn dismissing Mr. Hill’s complaint for lack of jurisdiction,\nthe district court stated:\nBecause Plaintiff’s motion raises no true issues of\nnewly-discovered evidence, it is the functional\nequivalent of a successive petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus.  Robinson, 358 F.3d at 1284.  As such, he\nshould have first sought the permission of the Eleventh\nCircuit under 28 U.S.C. § 2244 to file such a\nsuccessive petition.  There is no indication in the\nrecord whatsoever that Plaintiff has followed this\nprocedure.  Absent authorization from the Eleventh\nCircuit, this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the\ninstant successive petition.\nHill v. State, Case No. 4:06-cv-032-SPM, at 5.\nIn upholding the district court’s order, the Eleventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals stated:\nIt is clear to us that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to consider appellant’s claim because it\nis the functional equivalent of a successive habeas\npetition and he failed to obtain leave of this court to\nfile it.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A).  And as the\npanel observed in  Robinson, “such an application to\n10\n\nfile a successive petition would be due to be denied in\nany event.  See In re Provanzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1235-\n36 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1256, 120\nS.Ct. 2710, 147 L.Ed.2d 979 (2000) (concluding that a\nclaim that lethal injection constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment does not meet the requirements of 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) or (B)).”\nHill v. Crosby, Case No. 06-10621 at 3.\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT  \nTHIS COURT SHOULD REVIEW THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE ELEVENTH\nCIRCUIT’S DETERMINATION THAT MR. HILL’S CHALLENGE TO A\nPARTICULAR PROTOCOL WHICH THE STATE PLANS TO USE DURING THE\nEXECUTION PROCESS CONSTITUTES A SUCCESSIVE HABEAS CORPUS\nPETITION.\nA. Uncertainty amongst the circuits\nIn Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004), this Court\naddressed the parameters of an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as\na vehicle for challenging a procedure relating to an inmate’s\nexecution: \nWe have not yet had occasion to consider whether civil\nrights suits seeking to enjoin the use of a particular\nmethod of execution — e.g., lethal injection or\nelectrocution — fall within the core of federal habeas\ncorpus or, rather, whether they are properly viewed as\nchallenges to the conditions of a condemned inmate’s\ndeath sentence. Neither the “conditions” nor the “fact\nor duration” label is particularly apt. A suit seeking\nto enjoin a particular means of effectuating a sentence\nof death does not directly call into question the\n“fact” or “validity” of the sentence itself — by\nsimply altering its method of execution, the State can\ngo forward with the sentence. Cf. Weaver v. Graham, 450\nU.S. 24, 32-33, n. 17 (1981) (no ex post facto\nviolation to change method of execution to more humane\nmethod). On the other hand, imposition of the death\npenalty presupposes a means of carrying it out. In a\nState such as Alabama, where the legislature has\nestablished lethal injection as the preferred method of\n11\n\nexecution, see Ala. Code § 15-18-82 (Lexis Supp. 2003)\n(lethal injection as default method), a constitutional\nchallenge seeking to permanently enjoin the use of\nlethal injection may amount to a challenge to the fact\nof the sentence itself. A finding of\nunconstitutionality would require statutory amendment\nor variance, imposing significant costs on the State\nand the administration of its penal system. And while\nit makes little sense to talk of the “duration” of a\ndeath sentence, a State retains a significant interest\nin meting out a sentence of death in a timely fashion.\nSee Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 556-557 (1998);\nIn re Blodgett, 502 U.S. 236, 238 (1992) (per curiam);\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 491 (1991) (“[T]he\npower of a State to pass laws means little if the State\ncannot enforce them”).\nNelson, 541 U.S. at 643-4.\nThis Court concluded that it “need not reach here the\ndifficult question of how to categorize method-of-execution\nclaims generally.” Id. at 644.  Rather, in the specific case of a\ncut-down procedure, the Court stated:\nRespondents at oral argument conceded that § 1983 would\nbe an appropriate vehicle for an inmate who is not\nfacing execution to bring a “deliberate indifference”\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the cut-down\nprocedure if used to gain venous access for purposes of\nproviding medical treatment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (“I\ndon’t disagree . . . that a cut-down occurring for\npurposes of venous access, wholly divorced from an\nexecution, is indeed a valid conditions of confinement\nclaim”); see also Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104\n(1976) (“We therefore conclude that deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\nconstitutes the `unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain’ proscribed by the Eighth Amendment” (citation\nomitted)). We see no reason on the face of the\ncomplaint to treat petitioner’s claim differently\nsolely because he has been condemned to die.\nId. at 644-5.\n12\n\nSubsequent to Nelson, there has been dissension amongst the\nvarious federal circuits in determining to what extent, if any, a\nchallenge to an execution procedure constitutes a colorable claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n1. Methods of execution can be challenged\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that a §\n1983 action is in fact a proper vehicle by which to challenge a\nmethod of execution. Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1068\n(9th Cir. 2005).  \n2. A particular protocol can be challenged\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, on the other hand, has\npermitted a § 1983 action where the Petitioner does not assert\nthat lethal injection generally is an unconstitutional method of\nexecution, but rather that the particular protocol the State\nplans to use is impermissible. Reid v. Johnson, 2004 U.S. App.\nLEXIS 15855, *6 (2004), stay vacated by Johnson v. Reid, 2004\nU.S. LEXIS 4856 (2004)(“In light of Nelson, we conclude that Reid\nhas stated a cognizable claim under § 1983. Like Nelson, Reid\ndoes not assert that lethal injection generally is an\nunconstitutional method of execution. Rather, he asserts only\nthat the particular protocol the State plans to use is\n13\n\nimpermissible; he acknowledges that other protocols would pass\nconstitutional muster.”).3 \n3. Leaving the issue open\nHowever, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has\ndeclined to directly address the issue, instead disposing of such\nclaims on other grounds. See, e.g., Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d\n414, 417 (5th Cir. 2004)(“We do not decide whether Harris\nproperly states a claim under § 1983, because even if he does, he\nis not entitled to the equitable relief he seeks.”). See also\nAldrich v. Johnson, 388 F.3d 159, 161 (5th Cir. 2004)(“Because\nAldrich did not allege or show that there is any alternative to\nthe protocol that the State proposes to use in his execution, the\ndistrict court properly dismissed his § 1983 action.”).    \n4. Any challenge amounts to a successive habeas\npetition\nFinally, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has\ndetermined that:\nAnd as the panel observed in  Robinson, “such an\napplication to file a successive petition would be due\nto be denied in any event.  See In re Provanzano, 215\n     3A United States District Court for the Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals has applied a similar logic. See Ross v. Rell, 392 F.\nSupp 2d 224, 226 (D.Ct. Conn. 2005)(note omitted)(“The plaintiff\nhere has not challenged the constitutionality of lethal injection\nin all cases, but only the specific protocol of drugs and\nattendant procedures used by the State of Connecticut as will be\napplied to Michael Ross. Therefore, the action properly may be\nconstrued as a section 1983 claim and not a petition for habeas\ncorpus relief.”).\n14\n\nF.3d 1233, 1235-36 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 530\nU.S. 1256, 120 S.Ct. 2710, 147 L.Ed.2d 979 (2000)\n(concluding that a claim that lethal injection\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment does not meet\nthe requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) or (B)).”\nHill v. Crosby, Case No. 06-10621 at 3.\nB. This Court should resolve the split in the circuits\nMr. Hill respectfully submits that this Court should grant\ncertiorari in order to resolve the dissension amongst the\ncircuits as to this issue. \nC. Mr. Hill’s complaint does not challenge a method of\nexecution generally\nIn any event, Mr. Hill maintains that his complaint brought\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not fall into the category of\n“method-of-execution claims generally.” Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644. \nAs in Nelson, Mr. Hill is not challenging the statutory provision\nwhich allows for lethal injection as a method of execution.4\n(“[A] constitutional challenge seeking to permanently enjoin the\nuse of lethal injection may amount to a challenge to the fact of\nthe sentence itself.” Id. at 693-4).  Rather, Mr. Hill is\n“seeking to enjoin a particular means of effectuating a sentence\nof death [which] does not directly call into question the ‘fact’\nor ‘validity’ of the sentence itself — by simply altering its\nmethod of execution, the State can go forward with the sentence.”\nId. at 693-4.  Here, it is the succession of chemicals to be\n     4In fact, the protocol utilized by the Department of\nCorrections is not part of any state statutory provision.   \n15\n\nutilized, in accordance with the Department of Correction’s\nprotocol, which creates a foreseeable risk of the gratuitous and\nunnecessary infliction of pain on a person being executed.  \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the substantial risk of\npunishments that “involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction\nof pain,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976); Louisiana\nex. rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947).  “Among the\n‘unnecessary and wanton’ inflictions of pain are those that are\n‘totally without penological justification.’” Rhodes v. Chapman,\n452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981).  The Eighth Amendment reaches\n“exercises of crue lty by laws other than those which inflict\nbodily pain or mutilation.” Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349,\n373 (1909).  It forbids laws subjecting a person to\n“circumstance[s] of degradation,” Id. at 366, or to\n“circumstances of terror, pain, or disgrace” “superadded” to a\nsentence of death. Id. at 370 (emphasis added).    \nMr. Hill submits that his complaint is a cognizable one\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as explained by this Court in Nelson, and\nthat the federal courts erroneously recharacterized it as a\nsuccesive habeas corpus petition.\n16\n\nCONCLUSION\nPetitioner, Clarence Edward Hill, requests that certiorari\nreview be granted.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/S/ D.

The district \ncourt  opinion  is  available  at  2006  WL  167585  and  is \nreprinted at J.A. 11-15.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on January 24, \n2006.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nJanuary  24,  2006.    This  Court  has  jurisdiction  under  28 \nU.S.C. § 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nprovides in relevant part: \n[N]or  [shall]  cruel  and  unusual  punishments  [be] \ninflicted. \nThe  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution provides in relevant part: \nNo  State  shall  . . .  deprive  any  person  of  life  [or] \nliberty . . . without due process of law . . . .  \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides in relevant part: \nEvery  person  who,  under  color  of  any  statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State \n. . . , subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of \nthe  United  States  or  other  person  within  the \njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution \nand laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \naction  at  law,  suit  in  equity,  or  other  proper \nproceeding for redress . . . . \n \n\n2 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  Introduction \nThis  case  presents  the  question  whether  there  is  any \nfederal forum for a condemned inmate who contends that a \nstate  corrections  department’s  discretionary  choice  of  an \nexcruciatingly  and  unnecessarily  torturous  method  for \ncarrying  out  a  lethal  injection  violates  the  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments.  The Eleventh Circuit below (and \nin  cases  preceding  and  following  this  one)  has  wholly \nforeclosed access to the federal courts for inmates who, while \nnot challenging the State’s right to execute them – or even \nthe State’s right to execute them by a humane lethal injection \nprocedure – seek a hearing on the claim that the procedure \nactually chosen by state officials is wantonly and needlessly \ncruel. \nThe  case  of  Petitioner  Clarence  Hill  provides  a  vivid \nillustration.    Mr.  Hill  contends  that  the  particular  lethal \ninjection procedures Florida intends to use to execute him \nviolate  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  those  procedures \ncreate a foreseeable probability that he will be subjected to \nexcruciating pain before death.  He sought to raise that claim \n–  following  the  conclusion  of  all  judicial  proceedings \nchallenging his conviction and sentence – by filing a federal \ncivil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 modeled on the \none this Court approved in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 \n(2004).  But the Eleventh Circuit recharacterized this action \nas a habeas corpus petition and then proceeded to hold that, \nbecause  of  Mr.  Hill’s  earlier  federal  habeas  petition \nchallenging his conviction and sentence, his present action \nwas an improper “second or successive [habeas] petition” – \neven  though  his  only  present  claim  challenges  the \ndiscretionary choice of a particular lethal injection procedure \nby the Florida Department of Corrections.  J.A. 9-10.  As a \nresult, Mr. Hill has been denied any federal forum for his \nEighth Amendment claim.  \n \n \n\n3 \nAs Mr. Hill will show, that result is impossible to square \nwith this Court’s decisions.  In Nelson, a unanimous Court \nheld that a condemned prisoner may use § 1983 to challenge \na particular lethal injection procedure as long as the relief \nsought  would  not  “necessarily  prevent  [the  State]  from \ncarrying out its execution.”  541 U.S. at 647 (emphasis in \noriginal).  Mr. Hill’s § 1983 challenge here falls squarely \nwithin the ambit of Nelson.  Should he prevail, the State \nwould  remain  free  to  carry  out  his  execution  by  a  lethal \ninjection using other more humane (and constitutional) lethal \ninjection procedures. \nIn all events, even if Mr. Hill’s suit were recharacterized \nas a habeas petition, the Eleventh Circuit erred in deeming it \nthe  functional  equivalent  of  a  “second  or  successive” \npetition.    In  this  case,  Mr.  Hill’s  claim  was  not  ripe  for \npresentation or judicial consideration until after his earlier \nfederal  habeas  case  was  final  and  the  Department  of \nCorrections’ execution process began – indeed, Florida did \nnot even adopt lethal injection as the presumptive method of \nexecution  until  after  the  denial  of  Mr.  Hill’s  first  federal \nhabeas was final.  Under this Court’s decisions in Stewart v. \nMartinez-Villareal,  523  U.S.  637  (1998),  and  Slack  v. \nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473 (2000), a state prisoner does not \npresent a successive petition when the petition raises a claim \nthat would not have been ripe at the time of the first petition. \nIt follows a fortiori from these decisions that Mr. Hill’s \nclaim is not subject to dismissal.  Because Nelson directly \nauthorizes the bringing of Mr. Hill’s claim in a § 1983 case, \nand  because  the  claim  would  not  have  been  subject  to \ndismissal under § 2244(b) even if brought in a habeas case \n(and  therefore  is  not  fairly  characterized  as  an  end-run \naround the limitations on habeas jurisdiction), there is no \nconceivable basis for concluding that the district court lacked \nsubject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. \n \n \n\n4 \n  B.  Factual Background \nMr. Hill was convicted of murder and sentenced to death \nin 1983.  His death sentence was twice vacated in state and \nfederal postconviction proceedings.1  The Florida Supreme \nCourt reimposed the death sentence in 1995.  Hill v. State, \n643 So. 2d 1071 (Fla. 1995).  Mr. Hill then sought federal \nhabeas  corpus  relief  from  the  reimposed  sentence.    The \ndistrict court denied relief, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  \nHill v. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, \n528 U.S. 1087 (2000).   \nIn  January  2000,  after  Mr.  Hill’s  first  federal  habeas \ncorpus proceeding was  final, Florida amended  its laws to \nmake lethal injection the presumptive method of execution in \nthe  State.    Fla.  Stat.  § 922.105  provides  that  “[a]  death \nsentence  shall  be  executed  by  lethal  injection,  unless  the \nperson sentenced to death affirmatively elects to be executed \nby electrocution.”2 \n                                                 \n1 In 1985, the Florida Supreme Court invalidated the death sentence, Hill \nv. State, 477 So. 2d 553 (Fla. 1985), and Mr. Hill again received the death \nsentence in a resentencing proceeding in 1986.  The Florida Supreme \nCourt affirmed that sentence.  Hill v. State, 515 So. 2d 176 (Fla. 1987), \ncert. denied, 485 U.S. 993 (1988).  After an initial warrant for execution \nwas signed in November 1989, Mr. Hill sought postconviction relief in \nstate court and then in federal court.  In January 1990, the federal district \ncourt granted a stay of execution.  In 1992, the court granted Mr. Hill’s \npetition on the ground that the state trial court and the Florida Supreme \nCourt failed to conduct a proper harmless error inquiry when re-weighing \nthe aggravating factors supporting a death sentence after one of the \nfactors found by the trier of fact had been invalidated.  After that ruling, \nthe Florida Supreme Court reweighed the aggravating and mitigating \nfactors, and again sentenced Mr. Hill to death.  Hill v. State, 643 So. 2d \n1071 (Fla. 1995). \n \n2 Prior to January 2000, Florida law provided that “[a] death sentence \nshall be executed by electrocution.”  Fla. Stat. § 922.105 (1999).  The \nearlier  statute  provided  that,  in  the  event  electrocution  was  held \n \n \n\n5 \nThe Florida legislature did not prescribe by statute the \nprecise method to be used in carrying out lethal injections.  \nThat  authority  was  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  Florida \nDepartment of Corrections.  See Sims v. State, 754 So. 2d \n657, 670 (Fla. 2000) (noting that the Florida legislature did \nnot specify the procedures for lethal injection but left this \ndetermination up to the Department of Corrections “because \nit  has  personnel  better  qualified  to  make  such \ndeterminations”).  The Department of Corrections has not \npromulgated  any  regulation  or  published  any  guidance \nprescribing the lethal injection procedures it uses to execute \ncondemned  prisoners.    It  therefore  retains  complete \ndiscretion to design procedures for lethal injections and to \nmodify those procedures at any time for any reason.  The \nDepartment  could  do  so  based  on  advances  in  scientific \nunderstanding, knowledge gained through the experience of \nprior  lethal  injections  in  Florida  or  elsewhere,  or  even \nthrough negotiations with the condemned prisoner to avoid \nunnecessary risks of pain or suffering.  Cf. Nelson, 541 U.S. \nat  640-41  (describing  the  negotiations  between  the \ncondemned inmate and prison officials about the protocols \nfor his lethal injection). \nBecause the Department of Corrections does not publish \nany information about its lethal injection methods and is free \nto change methods at any time, it is impossible to know in \nadvance what procedures the Department will use to execute \nMr. Hill.  Mr. Hill sought to obtain that information from the \nDepartment, but his request was refused.  Compl. ¶ 15 n.3, \nJ.A. 21. \nThe only readily available source of information about \nFlorida’s practices for administering lethal injections is the \nrecord of the Sims case, in which the Secretary of Corrections \nand other witnesses described the procedure by which Florida \n                                                 \nunconstitutional, “all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall \nbe executed by lethal injection.”  Id. \n \n \n\n6 \nplanned to carry out lethal injections in 2000, when lethal \ninjection had only just been adopted.  754 So. 2d at 665 n.17.  \nThat  procedure  involved  the  use  of  a  three-chemical \nsequence.   \nThe  procedure  described  in  Sims  began  with  the \nadministration of two grams of sodium pentothal, the only \nanesthetic used in the process.  Sodium pentothal is a short-\nacting substance that produces a shallow level of anesthesia.  \nHealth care professionals use it only as an initial anesthetic in \npreparation for surgery while they set up a patient’s breathing \ntube and administer different drugs to bring the patient to a \nsurgical  plane  of  anesthesia  that  will  last  through  the \noperation  and  block  the  stimuli  of  surgery  that  would \notherwise cause pain.  Sodium pentothal is intended to be \ndefeasible by stimuli associated with errors in setting up the \nbreathing tube and initiating the deep anesthesia, so that the \npatient can wake up and signal to the staff that something is \nwrong.  Compl. ¶ 9, J.A. 18-19. \nThe second step of the procedure described in Sims was \nthe  administration  of  fifty  milligrams  of  pancuronium \nbromide, a paralytic agent that stops one’s breathing.  That \nchemical has three effects relevant here.  First, it causes the \ncondemned  prisoner  to  whom  it  is  administered  to  suffer \nsuffocation when the lungs are paralyzed.  Second, it blocks \nthe condemned prisoner from manifesting any suffering he or \nshe  might  be  experiencing  because  it  prevents  any \nmovement, speech, or facial expressions.  Compl. ¶ 10, J.A. \n19.    Third,  if  pancuronium  bromide  is  administered \nimproperly and comes into contact with sodium pentothal, \nthe sodium pentothal will precipitate and become ineffective.  \nSee, e.g., Brown v. Crawford, 408 F.3d 1027, 1028 (8th Cir. \n2005) (Bye, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 125  S. Ct. 2927 \n(2005).   \nThe  procedure  described  in  Sims  concluded  with  the \nadministration of 150 milliequivalents of potassium chloride, \n \n \n\n7 \nwhich inflicts death by causing cardiac arrest.  Potassium \nchloride burns intensely as it courses through the veins to the \nheart.  It also causes massive muscle cramping before cardiac \narrest.  Compl. ¶ 12, J.A. 19. \nThe practices outlined in Sims included no requirement \nthat  persons  knowledgeable  about,  or  trained  in  the \nadministration  of,  these  chemicals  carry  out  the  lethal \ninjection.  See Sims, 754 So. 2d at 665 n.17.  Although a \nphysician  apparently  stands  behind  the  executioner  and  a \nphysician’s  assistant  observes  the  execution  and  certifies \ndeath,  id.  at  666  n.17,  there  is  no  indication  that  either \nattendee has the ability to monitor the inmate’s anesthetic \ndepth from the inmate’s side (or even from the same room); \nthat  the  observers  are  appropriately  trained  to  detect \ninadequate anesthetic depth; that the executioner has been \ngiven appropriate training, including careful instructions on \nhow  to  number  and  operate  the  syringes  to  avoid \nmisadministration  of  the  chemicals;  or  that  the  IV  tubes \nrunning from the syringe to the inmate’s body are properly \ndesigned and attached so that the chemicals do not leak.  It \nalso does not indicate the duration between injections or how \nand where the inmate’s veins will be accessed.3  In short, \nthere  is  no  indication  that  the  procedures  used  by  the \nDepartment  of  Corrections  (as  described  in  Sims)  contain \nadequate  safeguards  to  ensure  that  the  chemicals  and \nmethods  of  administration  do  not  cause  unnecessary  or \nwanton pain. \nThis is especially troubling given that the chemicals the \nDepartment  of  Corrections  has  selected  are  themselves \nvolatile  and  likely  to  give  rise  to  wanton  pain  in  many \n                                                 \n3 A “cut-down” procedure would, for instance, raise serious constitutional \nconcerns.  See, e.g., Nelson, 541 U.S. at 642.  Additionally, at least one \ncourt has already ruled unconstitutional lethal injection into the jugular \nvein of the neck of the condemned prisoner.  See Baze v. Rees, No. 04-CI-\n01094, slip op. at 13 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 8, 2005). \n \n \n\n8 \ncircumstances.    If  sodium  pentothal  fails  to  perform  its \nanesthetic  function  (because  it  has  been  administered \nimproperly  or  in  an  incorrect  dosage4),  the  condemned \nprisoner  will  endure  intense  suffering  (from  conscious \nsuffocation)  and  excruciating  pain  (from  the  effects  of \npotassium  chloride  in  the  veins  and  on  the  muscles).  \nMoreover, because of the paralyzing effects of pancuronium \nbromide, the person being executed will lack the ability to \nconvey suffering to those supervising the execution.   \nFlorida’s  procedure  is  similar  to  procedures  that  two \ndistrict courts have recently found to raise serious questions \nunder the Eighth Amendment.  See Morales v. Hickman, __ \nF. Supp. 2d __, 2006 WL 335427, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, \n2006)  (finding  that  administration  of  same  three-chemical \nsequence raises “substantial questions” that the condemned \nwould  be  subjected  to  “an  undue  risk  of  extreme  pain”), \naff’d, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL 391604 (9th Cir.

Proceedings Below \nOn November 29, 2005, the Governor of Florida signed \nan execution warrant that set Mr. Hill’s execution for January \n24,  2006.

The Department refused to \nprovide any information in response.  Compl. ¶ 15 n.3, J.A. \n21. \nFollowing the Department’s refusal to comply with his \nDecember  8,  2005  demands,  Mr.  Hill  filed  a  state \npostconviction  petition on  December  15,  2005,  raising  an \nEighth Amendment challenge to the particular procedures the \nDepartment intended to use to execute him and seeking an \nevidentiary hearing to marshal evidence regarding the risks \nof wanton pain and suffering inherent in the procedures the \nDepartment  has  chosen.    The  Circuit  Court  for  Escambia \nCounty denied Mr. Hill’s request for an evidentiary hearing \nand dismissed his Eighth Amendment claim as procedurally \nbarred on December 23, 2005.  On January 3, 2006, Mr. Hill \nappealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the \nstate trial court’s decision on January 17, 2006.  Hill v. State, \nNo. SC06-2, __ So. 2d __, 2006 WL 91302 (Fla. Jan. 17, \n2006), cert. denied, No. 05-8731, 2006 WL 160276 (Feb. 27, \n2006).  \nOn January 20, 2006, Hill filed a complaint in the United \nStates  District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of  Florida \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The complaint asserted that \nthe  particular  procedures  the  Department  of  Corrections \nintended to use to execute him “will cause unnecessary pain \nin the execution of a sentence of death, thereby depriving \nPlaintiff  of  his  rights  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.”  \n \n \n\n10 \nCompl. ¶ 18, J.A. 21.  The complaint sought a preliminary \ninjunction prohibiting Mr. Hill’s execution until his Eighth \nAmendment claim could be adjudicated, and a “permanent \ninjunction[] barring defendants from executing Plaintiff in \nthe manner they currently intend.”  Compl. ¶ 20, J.A. 22 \n(emphasis added).  The complaint neither alleged nor implied \nthat the State lacked the authority to execute Mr. Hill by a \ndifferent and lawful method, including by a different lawful \nmethod of lethal injection.  Indeed, in a motion seeking a stay \nof  execution,  Mr.  Hill  expressly  stated  that  he  “is  not \nchallenging the statutory provision which allows for lethal \ninjection as a method of execution.  Rather, he is ‘seeking to \nenjoin a particular means of effectuating a sentence of death \n[which]  does  not  directly  call  into  question  the  “fact”  or \n“validity”  of  the  sentence  itself  –  by  simply  altering  its \nmethod,  the  State  can  go  forward  with  the  sentence.’”  \nApplication  for  a  Stay  of  Execution  and  for  Expedited \nAppeal at 12 (quoting Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644) (footnote \nomitted), J.A. 46.   \nThe district court denied relief on January 21, 2006.  The \ncourt  believed  that  Eleventh  Circuit  precedent  dictated \ndismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  J.A. 12-15 \n(citing Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004), \nand  In  re  Provenzano,  215  F.3d  1233  (11th  Cir.  2000)).  \nSpecifically,  the  court  held  that  under  Robinson  and \nProvenzano,  Hill’s  § 1983  claim  was  “the  functional \nequivalent of a successive petition for writ of habeas corpus.”  \nJ.A. 15.  Having recharacterized the § 1983 claim in that \nmanner, the court dismissed the claim for lack of subject \nmatter  jurisdiction  because  Hill  had  not  first  sought \npermission  from  the  Eleventh  Circuit  to  file  a  successive \nhabeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b), and because \nhe  could  not,  in  the  district  court’s  view,  have  obtained \npermission  if  he  sought  it.    The  district  court’s  decision \nrested on its description of Mr. Hill’s complaint as one that \nsought “a permanent injunction barring the execution of his \n \n \n\n11 \ndeath  sentence”  (J.A.  12)  –  notwithstanding  that  the \ncomplaint expressly sought only the narrower relief of an \ninjunction “barring defendants from executing Plaintiff in the \nmanner  they  currently  intend.”    Compl.  ¶  20  (emphasis \nadded), J.A. 22. \nThe district court did not mention this Court’s decision in \nNelson v. Campbell or apply the analysis set forth in that \ndecision for determining when a challenge to the procedures \nused for execution by lethal injection can properly be brought \npursuant to § 1983.  Nor did the court mention the fact that \nMr.  Hill  could  not  have  brought  his  Eighth  Amendment \nchallenge  during  his  prior  federal  habeas  proceedings \nbecause the claim would have been manifestly unripe at that \npoint.   \nHill filed an emergency appeal in the Eleventh Circuit, \nwhich affirmed the district court on January 24, 2006.  Like \nthe district court, the Eleventh Circuit described Mr. Hill’s \ncomplaint  as  seeking  “a  permanent  injunction  barring  his \nexecution.”    J.A.  9.    The  Eleventh  Circuit  also  failed  to \nmention  this  Court’s  decision  in  Nelson  or  to  apply  the \nprinciples set forth in that decision for determining whether a \nclaim such as the one Mr. Hill actually raised was proper \nunder § 1983.  Instead, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the \ndistrict  court  that  Mr.  Hill’s  § 1983  claim  was  properly \nrecharacterized  as  a  successive  habeas  petition  and  was \nproperly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   \nMr. Hill filed a petition for certiorari and sought a stay \nfrom  this  Court  on  January  24,  2006.    Justice  Kennedy \ngranted a temporary stay on January 24, 2006, and the Court \ngranted the petition and a full stay on January 25, 2006.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments that inflict \nunnecessary and wanton pain.  It permits sentences of death \nto be carried out, but not in a manner that is more torturous \n \n \n\n12 \nthan necessary to extinguish life.  Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nPetitioner  Hill  contends  that  the  procedures  the  Florida \nDepartment  of  Corrections  intends  to  use  to  execute  him \nviolate  the  Eighth  Amendment  because  those  procedures \nsubject  him  to  needless  excruciating  pain  before  death.  \nCharacterizing Mr. Hill’s claim as a challenge to Florida’s \nauthority to execute him, the Eleventh Circuit held that Mr. \nHill  could  not  pursue  the  claim  in  a  § 1983  action,  and \nfurther held that he could not pursue it in a habeas corpus \naction because such an action would be an improper “second \nor  successive”  petition  within  the  meaning  of  28  U.S.C. \n§ 2244(b).  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit denied Mr. Hill any \nfederal forum to adjudicate his Eighth Amendment claim.    \nNelson  v.  Campbell  requires  reversal  of  the  Eleventh \nCircuit’s decision.  Nelson squarely holds that a condemned \ninmate  may  bring  a  § 1983  action  to  challenge  a  State’s \nproposed lethal injection procedures so long as judicial relief \nprohibiting the procedure would not “necessarily prevent [the \nState] from carrying out its execution.”  541 U.S. at 647 \n(emphasis in original).  Under that standard, Mr. Hill plainly \nhas  the  right  to  proceed  with  his  § 1983  action.    He \nchallenges only the particular procedures the Department of \nCorrections will employ in executing him, and the permanent \nrelief  he  seeks  is  limited  to  an  injunction  barring  the \nDepartment  from  executing  him  “in  the  manner  they \ncurrently  intend”  to  use.    Compl.  ¶¶ 19-20,  J.A.  22.  \nMoreover, he has acknowledged that he could be executed by \na  different  means  of  lethal  injection  chosen  by  the \nDepartment.  J.A. 46 (“by simply altering its method, the \nState can go forward with the sentence” (quoting Nelson, 541 \nU.S. at 644)).  In no sense can his claim be characterized as a \nchallenge to the fact or duration of his confinement (or to the \nState’s authority to execute him)  that is cognizable only in \nfederal habeas proceedings.  Cf. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 \nU.S. 475, 488-90 (1973).  Thus, as in Nelson, the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in holding that Mr. Hill’s § 1983 action should \n \n \n\n13 \nbe  recharacterized  as  a  “second  or  successive”  habeas \npetition and dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \nEven if Mr. Hill’s § 1983 complaint were recharacterized \nas a habeas petition, the Eleventh Circuit erred in concluding \nthat it was a “second or successive” petition subject to the \ngatekeeping  restrictions  of  28  U.S.C.  § 2244(b).    This \nCourt’s decisions in Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. \n637 (1998), and Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473 (2000), \nestablish  that  the  statutory  phrase  “second  or  successive \npetition” is a term of art that draws its meaning from the \nCourt’s  “abuse  of  the  writ”  doctrine.    Under  this  settled \nunderstanding  of  the  meaning  of  the  statutory  term,  Mr. \nHill’s recharacterized § 1983 action was not a “second or \nsuccessive” petition because his Eighth Amendment claim \nwas not ripe (indeed it lacked any factual or legal predicate) \nuntil  after  his  federal  habeas  proceedings  were  final.  \nMartinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. at 644; Slack, 529 U.S. at 486.  \nEven on its own terms, therefore, the Eleventh Circuit erred \nin  holding  that  the  district  court  lacked  subject  matter \njurisdiction to consider Mr. Hill’s Eighth Amendment claim. \nIn  sum,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  has  advanced  no  valid \nreason for dismissing Mr. Hill’s § 1983 action.  That action, \nwhich  is  on  all  fours  with  Nelson,  raises  an  Eighth \nAmendment  claim  within  the  “literal  applicability”  of \n§ 1983,  does  not  “challenge  the  fact  or  duration”  of  Mr. \nHill’s confinement (or the State’s authority to execute him \nusing more humane lethal injection procedures), and in no \nsense constitutes an effort to evade the procedural limitations \nthat apply to habeas actions.  See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 643, \n647.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. \nARGUMENT \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the “unnecessary and \nwanton infliction of pain.”  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, \n173 (1976) (citing Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 392 \n \n \n\n14 \n(1972)).    This  Court  has  long  held  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment protects prisoners from the “gratuitous infliction \nof suffering.”  Gregg, 428 U.S. at 183 (citing Wilkerson v. \nUtah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-36 (1878) and In re Kemmler, 136 \nU.S. 436, 447 (1890)).  In the capital punishment context, \nwhere  the  suffering  inflicted  in  executing  a  condemned \nprisoner is caused by procedures involving “something more \nthan  the  mere  extinguishment  of  life,”  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment is implicated.  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. \n238, 265 (1972) (quoting Kemmler, 136 U.S. at 447). \nOn  occasion,  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  a \nconstitutional  claim  of  cruelty  in  the  means  proposed  for \nconducting  an  execution  do  not  emerge  until  after  the \ncondemned  prisoner  has  completed  federal  habeas \nproceedings.  Such circumstances can arise where a State \nadopts a new and untested method of execution, or where \nevidence emerges raising the question whether an existing \nexecution method in fact inflicts gratuitous pain or suffering.5   \nThis is precisely such a case.  Florida did not adopt lethal \ninjection as the presumptive means of execution until January \n14, 2000, after Mr. Hill had completed federal habeas corpus \nproceedings challenging his conviction and sentence.  Thus \n                                                 \n5 For example, in Florida, after electrocuted prisoners caught on fire, were \nburned and charred, and bled excessively during executions, this Court \ngranted  certiorari  to  review  the  constitutionality  of  the  procedures \ninvolved in using Florida’s electric chair.  See Bryan v. Moore, 528 U.S. \n960 (1999), cert. dismissed, 528 U.S. 1133 (2000) (dismissing the writ \nafter Florida amended its procedures to provide for lethal injection as the \npresumptive method of execution); Provenzano v. Moore, 744 So. 2d \n413, 431-36 (Fla. 1999) (Shaw, J., dissenting) (describing executions), \ncert. denied, 528 U.S. 1182 (2000).  By the time of Bryan, it had become \napparent  that  Florida’s  condemned  prisoners  –  both  those  who  had \ncompleted federal habeas corpus proceedings and those who had not – \nfaced the possibility of a torturous and needlessly painful execution \nraising serious constitutional claims that merited federal court review. \n \n \n\n15 \nhe  could  not  have  adjudicated  any  challenge  to  lethal \ninjection during those proceedings – much less the specific \nnarrow challenge he raises to the particular procedures the \nDepartment (in its discretion) proposes to use to execute him.  \nYet under the law of the Eleventh Circuit, no federal court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim.  He \ncannot raise the claim in a federal habeas corpus petition \nbecause under the circuit’s law it is automatically deemed a \nsecond  or  successive  petition  and  subject  to  immediate \ndismissal on that basis.  Likewise, he cannot raise the claim \nin an action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because \nEleventh  Circuit  law  holds  that  such  claims  are  the \n“functional  equivalent”  of  a  second  or  successive  habeas \npetition, and must therefore be “recharacterized” as such and \ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for failure to \nmeet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b). \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit’s  position  demonstrates  the \nprescience  of  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist’s  observation  in \nMartinez-Villareal  that  such  purblind  and  far-reaching \nextensions of § 2244(b) are fraught with “implications . . . \n[that] would be . . . seemingly perverse.”  523 U.S. at 644.  It \ncategorically denies Mr. Hill recourse to a forum necessary \nfor the vindication of his rights and does so arbitrarily, on the \nbasis of an accident of timing over which he had no control.  \nThis is radically at odds with the fundamental tenet of Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition expressed in the maxim ubi jus, ubi \nremedium – where there is a right there is a remedy – a \nmaxim classically viewed as central to the rule of law.  Chief \nJustice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison quoted Blackstone \nfor the proposition that “‘it is a general and indisputable rule, \nthat where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy \nby suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded.’”  5 \nU.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803).  And the Chief Justice \nadded  that  “[t]he  very  essence  of  civil  liberty  certainly \nconsists  in  the  right  of  every  individual  to  claim  the \nprotection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.”  Id. \n \n \n\n16 \nThis  Court’s  recent  unanimous  decision  in  Nelson  v. \nCampbell – which reviewed an Eleventh Circuit ruling that, \nlike the one here, denied the petitioner any federal forum for \nadjudicating  an  Eighth  Amendment  challenge  to  lethal \ninjection  procedures  –  prescribed  a  rule  of  decision  that \navoided this perversity by marking out a clear path through \nwhich  condemned  prisoners  such  as  Mr.  Hill  can  bring \nchallenges pursuant to § 1983, so long as the challenge, if \nsuccessful, would not preclude a state from carrying out an \notherwise valid sentence of death.  And, even apart from \nNelson, this Court had made clear in Martinez-Villareal and \nSlack that a habeas petitioner’s claim is not to be considered \na “second or successive” petition subject to the gatekeeping \nrestrictions of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) if the claim could not \nhave been brought (because it did not exist or was not ripe) at \nthe time of the petitioner’s first federal habeas proceedings.   \nIn this case, those two lines of clear authority converge.  \nMr.  Hill  has  an  unassailable  right  to  proceed  via  § 1983 \nbased on this Court’s ruling in Nelson.  And his claim was \nnot properly dismissed as a “second or successive” claim \nunder the logic of Martinez-Villareal and Slack because they \ndid not become ripe until long after his first federal habeas \nproceedings  concluded.    Therefore,  even  if  the  Eleventh \nCircuit were correct (and it is not) that Mr. Hill’s entitlement \nto raise his claim in a § 1983 proceeding would be defeated if \nthe claim were tested on the rules applicable to second or \nsuccessive habeas petitions, the plain fact is that the latter \nrules would permit a habeas adjudication of Mr. Hill’s cruel-\nand-unusual-method-of-execution claim.  Mr. Hill’s resort to \nthe civil remedy specifically designed by Congress for the \nrelief of persons imminently threatened by irremediable state \naction that would violate their federal civil rights is in no \nsense an end-run around the jurisdictional limits of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2244(b). \n \n \n\n17 \nThus,  the  Eleventh  Circuit’s  disposition  of  Mr.  Hill’s \nEighth  Amendment  claim  was  erroneous  and  should  be \nreversed.   \nI.  MR.  HILL’S  CLAIM  IS  PROPERLY  BROUGHT \nUNDER  42  U.S.C.  § 1983  BECAUSE  HE \nCHALLENGES  ONLY  THE  PARTICULAR \nPROCEDURES  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF \nCORRECTIONS  HAS  CHOSEN  TO  USE  TO \nEXECUTE  HIM  AND  NOT  THE  STATE’S \nAUTHORITY  TO  EXECUTE  HIM  BY  LAWFUL \nMEANS.   \nNelson  v.  Campbell  holds  that  a  condemned  inmate’s \nchallenge to a specific process for implementing the State’s \nchosen  method  of  execution  presents  a  cognizable  claim \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, so long as the inmate’s challenge \nwould not “necessarily prevent [the State] from carrying out \nits execution.”  541 U.S. at 647 (emphasis in original).  Mr. \nHill’s complaint falls squarely within the holding of Nelson.  \nHe  contends  only  that  the  particular  procedures  that  the \nDepartment (in its discretion) has chosen to use to execute \nhim violate the Eighth Amendment by causing unnecessary \nand torturous pain.  He concedes that other methods of lethal \ninjection  the  Department  could  choose  to  use  would  be \nconstitutional, and he seeks to enjoin the Department only \nfrom carrying out the execution “in the manner they currently \nintend.”  Here, as in Nelson, “by simply altering its method \nof execution, the State can go forward with the sentence.”  \n541 U.S. at 644. \nThe courts below held that habeas corpus provided the \nexclusive means for raising Mr. Hill’s challenge, and then \ndismissed that challenge as “the functional equivalent of a \nsuccessive habeas petition.”  J.A. 9-10, 15.  But the case law \non  which  they  rely  pre-dates  and  cannot  survive  Nelson.  \nBecause Mr. Hill’s claim is materially indistinguishable from \nthat in Nelson, the decision below should be reversed. \n \n \n\n18 \nA.  Nelson v. Campbell Permits An Action Under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 To Challenge The Process For Carrying \nOut A Lethal Injection. \nMr. Hill has appropriately invoked § 1983 to pursue his \nEighth Amendment claim.  Section 1983 authorizes a “suit in \nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress” against any \nperson who, under color of state law, “subjects, or causes to \nbe subjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the \ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured \nby the Constitution.”  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Mr. Hill’s lawsuit \nseeks  to  bar  Florida  from  executing  him  using  particular \nlethal  injection  procedures  that  impose  unnecessary  and \ntorturous pain and suffering.  Mr. Hill thus plainly seeks to \nvindicate rights and immunities secured to him by the Eighth \nAmendment.   \nAs this Court has explained, federal law provides two \navenues  for  prisoners’  complaints  related  to  their \nconfinement:  section 1983 and the federal habeas corpus \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2254.  See Muhammad v. Close, 540 \nU.S. 749, 750 (2004) (per curiam); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 \nU.S. 477, 480 (1994).  Habeas is the exclusive remedy for a \nstate  prisoner  who  challenges  the  fact  or  duration  of  his \nconfinement.  Heck, 512 U.S. at 481; Preiser v. Rodriguez, \n411 U.S. 475, 488-90 (1973).  By contrast, constitutional \nclaims that challenge how a lawfully imposed sentence is \ncarried out fall outside the core of habeas and are cognizable \nunder § 1983.  See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 643; Muhammad, 540 \nU.S. at 750.   \nTo  be  sure,  where  the  recognition  of  a  claim  will \nnecessitate  a  finding  that  a  state  prisoner’s  underlying \nconviction or sentence is invalid, the prisoner bringing such a \nclaim must file a habeas corpus petition.  See Preiser, 411 \nU.S. at 500 (“when a state prisoner is challenging the very \nfact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief \nhe seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate \n \n \n\n19 \nrelease or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole \nfederal  remedy  is  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus”).    Where, \nhowever, an inmate’s claim challenges the constitutionality \nof procedures that are ancillary to the prisoner’s conviction \nand sentence and can be corrected without undermining the \nintegrity  of  the  underlying  conviction  or  sentence,  then \n§ 1983 relief is available.  See Heck, 512 U.S. at 487 (finding \nthat state prisoners may bring § 1983 actions if a judgment in \nthe  prisoner’s  favor  would  not  “necessarily  imply”  the \ninvalidity  of  his  or  her  conviction  or  sentence);  Wolff  v. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974) (holding that § 1983 was a \npermissible  avenue  of  relief  when  adjudication  of  a \nprisoner’s  claim  would  not  undermine  the  outcome  of \ndisciplinary proceedings). \nApplying  this  settled  law,  Nelson  addressed  whether \n§ 1983  is  a  proper  vehicle  for  challenging  the  specific \nprocedure a State uses to carry out a death sentence.  In \nNelson, a condemned prisoner filed a § 1983 challenge to the \n“cut-down” procedure to be used to access his veins for lethal \ninjection,  contending  that  the  procedure  would  inflict \nunnecessary pain and suffering prior to his death.  Nelson, \n541  U.S.  at  642,  645.    Nothing  in  the  Alabama  statutes \nprescribing lethal injection as the method of execution for \nthat State’s condemned prisoners required such a procedure.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit nonetheless held that the § 1983 claim \nhad to be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction \nbecause  it  was  the  functional  equivalent  of  a  second  or \nsuccessive  habeas  petition  subject  to  the  gatekeeping \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b).  Id. \nThis Court reversed, holding that a condemned person \nmay bring a § 1983 challenge to a specific lethal injection \nprocedure, so long as judicial relief prohibiting the procedure \nwould not “necessarily prevent [the State] from carrying out \nits execution.”  Id. at 647 (emphasis in original).  That is so \nbecause  “[a]  suit  seeking  to  enjoin  a  particular  means  of \n \n \n\n20 \neffectuating a sentence of death does not directly call into \nquestion the ‘fact’ or ‘validity’ of the sentence itself.”  Id. at \n644.    Rather,  it  challenges  how  the  State  carries  out  a \nlawfully  imposed  sentence.    Such  an  approach  is  entirely \nconsistent with Preiser and its progeny, and “both protects \nagainst the use of § 1983 to circumvent any limits imposed \nby the habeas statute and minimizes the extent to which the \nfact  of  a  prisoner’s  imminent  execution  will  require \ndifferential  treatment  of  his  otherwise  cognizable  § 1983 \nclaims.”  Id. at 674. \nApplying  that  standard,  the  Court  held  that  Nelson’s \naction fell squarely within the ambit of § 1983.  The “venous \naccess” procedure there at issue was not mandated by state \nlaw, and Nelson conceded that other procedures for gaining \naccess were constitutional.  Nelson’s challenge thus did not \nnecessarily imply the invalidity of the inmate’s conviction or \nthe State’s ability ultimately to carry out the death sentence.  \nNelson could therefore proceed under §1983. \nB.  Mr. Hill’s Case Is Indistinguishable From Nelson And \nThus The Eleventh Circuit Erred In Dismissing Mr. \nHill’s § 1983 Claim. \nMr. Hill’s claim is indistinguishable from the claim at \nissue in Nelson.  He alleges that the particular procedures the \nDepartment has chosen to use for his execution “create[] a \nforeseeable risk of the gratuitous and unnecessary infliction \nof pain on a person being executed” in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Compl. ¶ 8, J.A. 18; see also id. ¶¶ 9-16, J.A. \n18-21.  Like Mr. Nelson, therefore, Mr. Hill challenges only \na specific method of administering lethal injection.  He does \nnot assert that that lethal injection per se violates the Eighth \nAmendment, and he does not contest the State’s authority to \ncarry out his execution.  To the contrary, Mr. Hill seeks relief \nlimited to an injunction “barring defendants from executing \nPlaintiff in the manner they currently intend.”  Compl. ¶¶ 19-\n20 (emphasis added), J.A. 22.  Were his action successful, \n \n \n\n21 \nMr. Hill could still be executed by a different procedure, \nincluding a different means of lethal injection chosen by the \nDepartment.  Indeed, in his district court submissions, Mr. \nHill expressly stated that “‘by simply altering its method, the \nState can go forward with the sentence.’”  Application for a \nStay of Execution and for Expedited Appeal at 12, J.A. 46 \n(quoting Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644).  Mr. Hill’s challenge is \nthus  plainly  proper  under  § 1983,  because  it  does  not \n“necessarily imply” the invalidity of the fact or length of the \ninmate’s sentence.  See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646.6 \nRuling for Mr. Hill does not require this Court to address \nany of the questions this Court reserved in Nelson.  The case \ndoes not present, for example, the broader question of how to \naddress  general  method-of-execution  claims,  such  as  a \nchallenge  to  electrocution  or  hanging.    Nor  is  Mr.  Hill’s \nEighth Amendment challenge one that seeks sub silentio to \n                                                 \n6  If  anything,  this  case  is  easier  than  Nelson.    Nelson’s  complaint \nrequested “an order granting injunctive relief and staying [petitioner’s] \nexecution.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 648 (alteration in original).  The Court \nindicated that this phrasing complicated the issue, because the request for \na permanent injunction “did not specify what permanent injunctive relief \n[petitioner] was seeking,” id., and therefore might have “transformed his \nconditions of confinement claim into a challenge to the validity of his \ndeath sentence,” id. at 647.  Despite this inartful phrasing, this Court \nconcluded that “a fair reading of the complaint leaves no doubt that \npetitioner was asking only to enjoin the State’s use of the cut-down, not \nhis execution by lethal injection.”  Id. at 648. \n  Hill’s filings below make unmistakably clear that he seeks only to \nbar the State’s corrections officials from executing him before his claim \nhas been heard and from executing him “in the manner they currently \nintend.”  Compl. ¶¶ 19-20, J.A. 22; see also Application for a Stay of \nExecution and for Expedited Appeal at 12, J.A. 46 (“Mr. Hill is not \nchallenging the statutory provision which allows for lethal injection as a \nmethod of execution.  Rather, he is ‘seeking to enjoin a particular means \nof effectuating a sentence of death [which] does not directly call into \nquestion the “fact” or “validity” of the sentence itself – by simply altering \nits  method,  the  State  can  go  forward  with  the  sentence.’”)  (quoting \nNelson, 541 U.S. at 644).  \n \n \n\n22 \npreclude imposition of the death penalty by implying that all \nmethods of execution are cruel and unusual.  To the contrary, \nHill  alleges  only  that  the  particular  procedures  the \nDepartment  intends  to  use  to  execute  him  create  a \nforeseeable  risk  of  wanton  pain.    His  is  not  a  challenge \nobjecting merely to the pain inherent in death.  \nMr. Hill’s claim similarly does not require the Court to \ndetermine the proper outcome in the situation left unresolved \nin  Nelson  –  where  the  challenged  execution  practices  are \ndictated by statute.  541 U.S. at 645.  The relevant Florida \nstatute authorizes lethal injection, but dictates no particular \nprocedure for carrying it out.  See Fla. Stat. § 922.10 (“A \ndeath sentence shall be executed by electrocution or lethal \ninjection.”).    Nor  does  any  Florida  regulation  require  the \nspecific  procedures  at  issue  here.    The  Department  of \nCorrections therefore has complete discretion to change the \nmethod  of  lethal  injection  to  comply  with  the  Eighth \nAmendment – at any time and for any reason.  See Sims, 754 \nSo. 2d at 670.   \nIndeed, the Department could readily adopt any one of a \nnumber of different approaches to lethal injection that would \nend  Mr.  Hill’s  life  without  a  foreseeable  likelihood  of \nexcruciating pain.  See, e.g., Morales, 2006 WL 335427, at \n*8.  It could therefore afford Mr. Hill all of the relief he seeks \nin this lawsuit without requiring “statutory  amendment or \nvariance” that might “impos[e] significant costs on the State \nand the administration of its penal system.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. \nat 644.7 \n                                                 \n7 For these reasons, it is impossible to construe Mr. Hill’s claim as the \nequivalent of a direct challenge to Florida’s statutorily prescribed method \nof execution.  But even if it were such a challenge, his claim would still \nbe properly brought under § 1983 because no statutory changes would be \nrequired if the challenge succeeded.  Florida statutes already provide for \nthe enforcement of a death sentence even if the statutorily prescribed \nmethod of execution is held unconstitutional.  See Fla. Stat. § 922.105(3) \n \n \n\n23 \nBecause  Nelson  is  plainly  controlling  in  this \ncircumstance, it is not surprising that, with the exception of \nthe  Eleventh  Circuit,  every  court  of  appeals  to  have \naddressed  the  question  has  recognized  that  claims \nchallenging particular lethal injection procedures (but not the \nstate’s authority to carry out execution by lethal injection) \nmay proceed under § 1983.  See, e.g., White v. Johnson, 429 \nF.3d  572,  573  (5th  Cir.  2005)  (per  curiam);  Beardslee  v. \nWoodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1068 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 \nU.S. 1096 (2005); Reid v. Johnson, 105 Fed. Appx. 500, 503 \n(4th Cir. 2004); Bryan v. Mullin, 100 Fed. Appx. 801, 802-03 \n(10th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1096 (2005); see also \nJohnston v. Crawford, No. 04CV1075, 2005 WL 1474022, at \n*2 (E.D. Mo. June 13, 2005); Ross ex rel. Ross v. Rell, 392 F. \nSupp. 2d 224, 226 (D. Conn. 2005). \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit’s  divergent  approach  appears  to \nresult from its consistent practice of treating every challenge \nto particular procedures for administering a lethal injection as \nequivalent to a challenge to the state’s authority to carry out \nany execution.  For example, in Robinson v. Crosby, 358 \nF.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam), the Eleventh Circuit \nconstrued Mr. Robinson’s challenge to Florida’s method of \nadministering  lethal  injection  as  a  broad  contention  that \n“seeks  to  avoid  entirely  execution  by  lethal  injection”  – \nnotwithstanding  that  Robinson’s  complaint  appeared  to \nchallenge only the particular procedures that were to be used \nin executing him.  358 F.3d at 1285.  Similarly, in the present \ncase,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  erroneously  characterized  Mr. \nHill’s  claim  as  one  that  “seeks  a  permanent  injunction \nbarring his execution,” and on that basis dismissed it on the \nground that it raised “the very issue” that was decided in \nRobinson.  J.A. 10; see also Rutherford v. Crosby, No. 06-\n                                                 \n(“If electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional . . . all \npersons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any \nconstitutional method of execution.”); id. § 922.105(8). \n \n \n\n24 \n10783, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL 224123, at *1 (11th Cir. Jan. \n30, 2006) (per curiam) (invoking Robinson to dismiss a claim \nexpressly  challenging  only  “the  procedures  or  protocols” \nused to carry out lethal injections).  By characterizing the \nclaims brought in these cases as seeking relief broader than \nthey in fact seek, the Eleventh Circuit has apparently felt no \nneed  to  come  to  grips  with  the  rule  set  forth  in  Nelson.  \nBecause Mr. Hill’s claim is not the broad one the Eleventh \nCircuit  ascribed  to  him,  however,  Nelson  plainly  applies \nhere.  The district court thus had subject matter jurisdiction to \nadjudicate his claim. \nC.  Allowing Mr. Hill’s Claim To Proceed Is Consistent \nWith The Language And Purpose Of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, As Well As This Court’s Longstanding Case \nLaw. \nAllowing Mr. Hill to proceed with his § 1983 claim is \nconsistent with the language, purpose, and history of that \nstatute.    Hill’s  invocation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  to \nchallenge  the  particular  procedures  the  Department  has \nchosen  to  use  to  end  his  life  satisfies  all  the  statutory \nelements of § 1983.   It is a suit in equity against a state \nofficial who, under color of state law, is causing Hill to be \ndeprived  of  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  protections  against \ncruel and unusual punishment.  See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 643 \n(noting  that  Nelson’s  claim  falls  within  the  “literal \napplicability” of § 1983).  \nPermitting Hill’s claim to proceed is also consistent with \nthe purpose of § 1983.  The Civil Rights Act was passed “to \nafford a federal right in federal courts because, by reason of \nprejudice, passion, neglect, intolerance, or otherwise, state \nlaws might not be enforced and the claims of citizens to the \nenjoyments of rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed \nby the Fourteenth Amendment might be denied by these state \nagencies.”    Monroe  v.  Pape,  365  U.S.  167,  180  (1961), \noverruled on other grounds by Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., \n \n \n\n25 \n436 U.S. 658 (1978).  The State’s callous indifference to \nHill’s  constitutional  concerns  –  whether  motivated  by \nprejudice,  neglect,  intolerance,  or  something  else  –  falls \nwithin the intended scope of the Civil Rights Act.  Because \n§ 1983  authorizes  injunctive  actions  challenging  barbaric \nconditions of confinement, see, e.g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 681-83 (1978), it can hardly be supposed that the \nstatute does not also provide a cause of action to challenge a \nbarbaric method of execution.  Similarly, because an inmate \ncould bring a § 1983 action challenging the constitutionality \nof a callously painful chemical prescription used to provide \nmedical treatment, the result cannot plausibly be different \nwhen  the  chemicals  chosen  to  effectuate  an  execution \nproduce  unnecessary  pain.    See  Nelson,  541  U.S.  at  645 \n(“Merely  labeling  something  as  part  of  an  execution \nprocedure is insufficient to insulate it from a § 1983 attack.”).   \nSection  1983  has  been  traditionally  interpreted, \nfurthermore, to extend to inmate suits where, as here, the \nchallenged procedures can be restrained or corrected without \nimpugning  the  integrity  of  the  underlying  conviction  and \nsentence, i.e., without seeking “core” habeas corpus relief.  \nWilkinson  v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 1247 (2005). This \nrelationship between § 1983 and federal habeas corpus has \ndeep roots.  Indeed, “[a]t the time of § 1983’s adoption, the \nfederal  habeas  statute  mirrored  the  common-law  writ  of \nhabeas corpus, in that it authorized a single form of relief: the \nprisoner’s immediate release from custody.”  Dotson, 125 \nS. Ct.  at  1250  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring).    Section  1983, \ntherefore, would have presented the vehicle for relief outside \nof immediate release.  Although the federal habeas statute \nhas since been amended to provide “relief short of release,” \nid., a distinction between claims that lie within the “core of \nhabeas” and those that are cognizable under § 1983 remains \nintact.  Dotson, 125 S. Ct. at 1246 (quoting Preiser, 411 U.S. \nat 487). \n \n \n\n26 \nJust last term, the Court held that two state prisoners’ \nchallenge  to  Ohio’s  state  parole  procedures  was  properly \nbrought under § 1983, because the action did not lie “within \nthe  core  of  habeas  corpus.”    Dotson,  125  S. Ct.  at  1246 \n(quoting Preiser, 411 U.S. at 487).  The Court explained that \nactions lie within the core of habeas where they challenge the \n“‘fact  or  duration  of  . . .  confinement’  and  seek[]  either \n‘immediate release from prison,’ or the ‘shortening’ of [the] \nterm of confinement.”  Id. (quoting Preiser, 411 U.S. at 482, \n489)  (internal  citations  omitted).    In  other  words,  a  state \nprisoner’s § 1983 action is only barred “if success in that \naction  would  necessarily  demonstrate  the  invalidity  of \nconfinement or its duration.”  Dotson, 125 S. Ct. at 1248 \n(emphasis  in  original).    Because  the  two  state  prisoners \nsought  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  regarding  the \nprocedures  used  to  deny  parole  eligibility  and  suitability, \nrather  than  an  injunction  ordering  immediate  or  speedier \nrelease, the actions were cognizable under § 1983.  Id.; see \nalso id. at 1250 (Scalia, J., concurring) (“[W]hat is sought \nhere [is] the mandating of a new parole hearing that may or \nmay not result in release, prescription of the composition of \nthe hearing panel, and specification of the procedures to be \nfollowed.  A holding that this sort of judicial immersion in \nthe administration of discretionary parole lies at the ‘core of \nhabeas’ would utterly sever the writ from its common-law \nroots.”). \nThe  Court’s  opinion  in  Dotson  traverses  the  “legal \njourney from Preiser to [Edwards v.] Balisok,” and clarifies \nthat, in every case,  \nthe Court has focused on the need to ensure that state \nprisoners use only habeas corpus  (or similar state) \nremedies when they seek to invalidate the duration of \ntheir  confinement  –  either  directly  through  an \ninjunction compelling speedier release or indirectly \nthrough  a  judicial  determination  that  necessarily \n \n \n\n27 \nimplies  the  unlawfulness  of  the  State’s  custody.  \nThus, Preiser found an implied exception to § 1983’s \ncoverage where the claim seeks – not where it simply \n‘relates to’ – ‘core’ habeas corpus relief, i.e., where a \nstate prisoner requests present or future release.   \n125 S. Ct. at 1247 (emphasis in original). \nIn Wolff v. McDonnell, for instance, the inmate’s § 1983 \ncomplaint  sought  restoration  of  good-time  credits  and \ndamages for the deprivation of civil rights resulting from the \nuse of an allegedly unconstitutional procedure to determine \nthose credits.  See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 553; see also Heck, 512 \nU.S. at 482 (construing Wolff).  This Court found the § 1983 \nclaim for restoration of good time credits foreclosed under \nPreiser,  but  permitted  the  use  of  § 1983  to  obtain  a \ndeclaration that the disciplinary procedures were invalid, as \nwell  as  “ancillary  relief,”  Wolff,  418  U.S.  at  554-55 \n(emphasis added), because “[i]n neither case would victory \nfor the prisoners necessarily have meant immediate release or \na shorter period of incarceration; the prisoners attacked only \nthe ‘wrong procedures, not . . . the wrong result . . . .’”  \nDotson, 125 S. Ct. at 1246-47 (quoting Heck, 512 U.S. at 483 \n(discussing Wolff )); see also Wolff, 418 U.S. at 555 (“[A] \ndeclaratory  judgment  as  a  predicate  to  a  damages  award \nwould not be barred by Preiser; and because under that case \nonly an injunction restoring good time improperly taken is \nforeclosed, neither would it preclude a litigant with standing \nfrom obtaining by way of ancillary relief an otherwise proper \ninjunction enjoining the prospective enforcement of invalid \nprison regulations.”).   \nFollowing the same reasoning, this Court concluded in \nHeck that an inmate’s claim for damages was not cognizable \nunder § 1983, when establishing the basis for damages would \nnecessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction or \nsentence.    512  U.S.  at  481-82.    Like  Preiser,  Heck \nrecognized that the dividing line was whether the plaintiff \n \n \n\n28 \nwas  challenging  the  fact  or  duration  of  his  sentence,  or \nsomething else.  Thus, a state prisoner who has not received \nfavorable termination of a state or federal habeas petition \ncannot state a cognizable § 1983 claim to recover damages \nfor a “harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would \nrender [his] conviction or sentence invalid.”  Id. at 486; see \nalso Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646.  But if “plaintiff’s action, even \nif  successful,  will  not  demonstrate  the  invalidity  of  any \noutstanding  criminal  judgment  against  the  plaintiff,  the \n[§ 1983] action should be allowed to proceed.”  Heck, 512 \nU.S.  at  487  (emphasis  in  original);  see  also  Edwards  v. \nBalisok,  520  U.S.  641,  646-48  (1997)  (holding,  in  a \nchallenge  to  prison  procedures  depriving  inmate  of  good-\ntime credits, that the claims for declaratory and monetary \nrelief that “necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment \nimposed” could not be brought under § 1983, but that a claim \nfor injunctive relief barring future procedures was permitted, \nbecause  “[o]rdinarily,  a  prayer  for  such  prospective  relief \nwill not ‘necessarily imply’ the invalidity of a previous loss \nof good-time credits”). \nNelson is entirely consistent with this line of cases.  It \nholds that § 1983 is available for the inmate who challenges \nthe  specific  procedure  by  which  he  will  be  executed,  as \nopposed to the validity of the death sentence itself.  541 U.S. \nat  644-45.    Nelson  thus  preserves  this  Court’s  repeated \nteaching that claims that do not attack the fact or duration of \nconfinement and thus lie outside the core of habeas corpus \nare cognizable under § 1983.   \nIndeed, Nelson was an even clearer case than Dotson.  \nWhereas  the  prisoners’  claim  in  Dotson  “would  not \nnecessarily  spell  speedier  release,”  125  S. Ct.  at  1247 \n(emphasis added), method-of-execution challenges, like the \nchallenge at issue in Nelson and the claim presented here by \nMr.  Hill,  necessarily  contemplate  that  the  inmate’s  death \nsentence  will  be  carried  out;  they  challenge  only  specific \n \n \n\n29 \naspects  of  the  procedure  that  entail  gratuitous  pain.    See \nNelson,  541  U.S.  at  645.    Allowing  Mr.  Hill’s  claim  to \nproceed is thus entirely consistent with § 1983’s place in our \nconstitutional and legal system. \nFor all the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hill’s narrow challenge \nto the specific procedures chosen by the Florida Department \nof Corrections is properly brought pursuant to § 1983.  Mr. \nHill  does  not  challenge  his  sentence  of  death  by  lethal \ninjection, but only specific aspects of the State’s means for \ncarrying  out  that  sentence.    The  Eleventh  Circuit  plainly \nerred, therefore, in dismissing the suit for lack of jurisdiction. \nII. MR. HILL’S CHALLENGE IS NOT A SECOND OR \nSUCCESSIVE PETITION UNDER AEDPA.  \nBecause Nelson establishes Mr. Hill’s right to proceed \nunder § 1983, it suffices to require a reversal of the Eleventh \nCircuit’s  determination  that  the  district  court  lacked \njurisdiction to adjudicate his Eighth Amendment challenge to \nthe  manner  of  his  execution.  Nevertheless,  there  is  an \nadditional reason why the Eleventh Circuit’s decision fails on \nits own terms.  Even if Mr. Hill’s § 1983 complaint were \nrecharacterized  as  a  habeas  challenge,  it  would  not  be  a \n“second or successive” petition subject to the gate-keeping \nprovisions  in  § 2244(b).    Thus,  there  was  no  basis \nwhatsoever  for  concluding  that  the  district  court  lacked \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  over  Mr.  Hill’s  claim  that  the \nDepartment of Corrections means to put him to death in a \ntorturous manner that violates the Eighth Amendment.  His \ninvocation  of  § 1983  cannot  plausibly  be  construed  as  an \nevasion of the jurisdictional restrictions on habeas corpus. \nSection 2244(b) requires petitioners who seek to file a \n“second or successive” habeas corpus petition to obtain leave \nfrom  the  appropriate  court  of  appeals,  28  U.S.C. \n§ 2244(b)(3), and it permits the court of appeals to grant such \nleave  only  in  narrow  circumstances,  see  id.  § 2244(b)(1), \n \n \n\n30 \n(2).8  This Court, however, has consistently rejected the view \nthat § 2244(b) applies to all claims brought in a numerically \n“second” (or subsequent) petition.  It has recognized, rather, \nthat the phrase “second or successive” in § 2244(b) is a “term \nof art” that draws its meaning from this Court’s “abuse of the \nwrit” doctrine.  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486 (2000).  \nThat settled understanding of the statute puts a constitutional \nclaim such as Mr. Hill’s here – a claim that was not ripe at \nthe time when the initial federal habeas petition was filed and \ndecided and which ripened only shortly before the filing of a \nsecond  petition  –  outside  the  scope  of  § 2244(b)’s  gate-\nkeeping provisions. \nIn  Martinez-Villareal,  for  example,  the  prisoner  had \nearlier  filed  a  habeas  petition  contending,  among  other \nthings, that he was incompetent to be executed under Ford v. \nWainright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986).  The district court denied \nthe petition, dismissing the Ford claim as unripe because no \nexecution date was imminent.  Once a new execution date \nwas set, thus rendering the Ford claim ripe for adjudication, \nMartinez-Villareal sought to raise the Ford claim again, and \nthe  State  challenged  the  filing  as  a  successive  petition.  \nAffirming the Ninth Circuit – which had disagreed with the \napproach of the Eleventh Circuit in In re Medina, 109 F.3d \n                                                 \n8 Section 2244(b)(2) provides: \nA claim presented  in a second or successive  habeas corpus \napplication under [28 U.S.C. § 2254] that was not presented in a \nprior application shall be dismissed unless – \n      (A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review \nby the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or \n      (B) (i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been \ndiscovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and \n         (ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in \nlight of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish \nby clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant \nguilty of the underlying offense. \n \n \n\n31 \n1556 (11th Cir. 1997) – this Court held that the presentation \nof  the  previously  unripe  Ford  claim  did  not  constitute  a \nsecond or successive petition.   Invoking this Court’s pre-\nAEDPA jurisprudence, see Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. at \n644-45,  the  Court  noted  that  the  State’s  reading  of \n§ 2244(b)(2) to bar claims that were previously unripe would \neffect a substantial departure from prior practice and that the \n“implications [of the State’s argument] for habeas practice \nwould be far reaching and seemingly perverse.”  523 U.S. at \n644. \nUnder  Martinez-Villareal,  Hill’s  challenge  to  the \nparticular  procedures  that  the  Florida  Department  of \nCorrections intends to use to execute him is not a “second or \nsuccessive” petition.  As noted above, Florida law gives the \nDepartment of Corrections total discretion to develop and \nimplement  the  process  for  executing  prisoners  for  lethal \ninjection.    Neither  the  combination  of  chemicals  nor  the \nprocedures for mixing and injecting them (and monitoring \ntheir effects)  are prescribed in statute or regulation.  The \nDepartment  retains  complete  flexibility  to  devise  and \nimplement injection protocols for any particular execution; \nand,  as  Mr.  Hill’s  case  demonstrates,  the  Department \naggressively  resists  inmates’  efforts  to  obtain  advance \ninformation about its intended procedures.  Thus, it is only \nwhen  an  execution  warrant  has  been  signed  and  the \nDepartment of Corrections begins to make its arrangements \nfor a particular execution that any constitutional challenge to \nthe execution procedures which the Department is preparing \nto use becomes ripe.  See Worthington v. Missouri, 166 S.W. \n3d  566,  583  n.3  (Mo.  2005)  (holding  that  an  Eighth \nAmendment claim challenging a particular lethal injection \nprocedure  is  “premature”  because  “it  is  unknown  what \nmethod, if any, of lethal injection may be utilized by the \nState  of  Missouri  at  such  future  time,  if  any,  as  Mr. \nWorthington’s right to seek relief in state and federal court is \nconcluded and his execution method and date are set”).  And \n \n \n\n32 \nonce  such  a  constitutional  challenge  ripens,  Martinez-\nVillareal permits it to be raised on federal habeas without a \ngatekeeping  application  under  § 2244(b),  notwithstanding \nthat the condemned inmate has had his underlying conviction \nand  sentence  reviewed  in  a  previous  federal  habeas \nproceeding. \nTo be sure, the Court in Martinez-Villareal reserved the \nquestion of how its decision would apply to a previously \nunripe  claim  that  had  not  been  presented  on  first  federal \nhabeas.  523 U.S. at 645 n.*.  The Court’s decision, however, \nleaves  no  doubt  of  the  outcome.    See  generally  Clark  v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 378 (2005) (finding that the logic of \na prior opinion compelled the answer to question expressly \nreserved in that opinion).  The Court ruled as it did even \nthough the district court in Martinez-Villareal had rendered a \nfinal judgment denying the initial habeas petition and had not \nheld  the  initial  Ford  claim  in  abeyance.    The  subsequent \nfiling  raising  the  ripened  claims  was  thus  in  no  sense  a \n“continuation” of the first petition, as the dissent emphasized.  \nSee  Martinez-Villareal,  523  U.S.  at  650  (Thomas,  J. \ndissenting).    The  plain  import  of  Martinez-Villareal, \ntherefore, is that timely presentation of a previously unripe \nclaim is not a second or successive petition under AEDPA, \nand that a prisoner should have at least one opportunity to \npresent  his  federal  claims  to  the  federal  court.    To  hold \notherwise would deny a habeas petitioner the opportunity to \nobtain the “adjudication of his claim” to which he is entitled.  \nMartinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. at 645.9  \n                                                 \n9 The rule of Martinez-Villareal cannot conceivably be that, in order to \nbring  their  possible  future  claims  within  it,  inmates  are  required  to \nanticipate  the  various  possible  constitutionally  challengeable  actions \nwhich correctional officers might (or might not) later take in the course of \nexecution of the inmate’s sentence and to insert those challenges into ever \ninitial federal habeas petition.  Such a rule would impose a staggering \nburden on the district courts to receive and read through premature claims \nfor no purpose other than to cull them out.  Furthermore, such a game of \n \n \n\n33 \nSlack confirms this reading of Martinez-Villareal.  See \nSlack, 529 U.S. at 486.  In Slack, the district court dismissed \nthe state prisoner’s initial federal habeas petition because it \ncontained claims that had not yet been litigated in state court.  \nOnce the prisoner had gone to state court and exhausted his \nclaims, he returned to federal court and eventually filed a \nnew petition, adding claims that had not been raised in the \ninitial  petition.    This  Court  squarely  rejected  the  State’s \ncontention  that  the  subsequent  petition  was  a  “second  or \nsuccessive petition” as that term was used in AEDPA.  Id. \nJustice  Kennedy’s  opinion  for  seven  members  of  the \nCourt  recognized  that  the  term  “second  or  successive \npetition” in AEDPA was a “term of art given substance in \nour prior habeas corpus cases.”  529 U.S. at 486; see also \nFelker  v.  Turpin,  518  U.S.  651,  664  (1996)  (“The  new \nrestrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res \njudicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus \npractice  ‘abuse  of  the  writ.’”).    Thus,  as  in  Martinez-\nVillareal,  the  Court  looked  to  its  pre-AEDPA  “second  or \nsuccessive” cases – in particular McCleskey v. Zant, 455 U.S. \n509 (1991), and Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982) – to give \nmeaning to the term.  Because Slack’s claims would not have \nbeen considered an abusive “second or successive petition” \nas the Court had defined that term of art, § 2244(b)(2) did not \nbar Slack’s claims. \nThe same analysis demonstrates that Hill’s presentation \nof his newly ripened claim is not “second or successive.” A \nfederal habeas petition presenting a claim that was unripe at \nthe  time  of  a  previous  petition  would  not  have  been  an \nabusive successive petition prior to AEDPA.  The abuse-of-\nthe-writ  doctrine  received  its  fullest  treatment  in  Justice \nKennedy’s opinion in McCleskey.  There the Court noted that \n                                                 \n“what if” contravenes the basic tenet of our system of adjudication, that \nclaims are brought when they are sufficiently concrete to permit non-\nspeculative, fact-informed resolution.  \n \n \n\n34 \n“the  abuse-of-the-writ  doctrine  . . .  concentrate[s]  on  a \npetitioner’s acts to determine whether he has a legitimate \nexcuse for failing to raise a claim at the appropriate time.”  \n499 U.S. at 490.  It has never been thought an abuse of the \nwrit to fail to raise an unripe claim in one’s first federal \nhabeas petition and then, after the claim ripens, to base a later \nhabeas petition upon it.  See id. at 493-94; see also 2 Randy \nHertz & James S. Leibman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice \nand Procedure § 28.3b at 1410 (5th ed. 2005) (noting that, \npre-AEDPA, a petition was not subject to the rules governing \n“successive”  petitions  when  the  “earlier  petition  did  not \nproduce,  or  for  some  reason  could  not  possibly  have \nproduced,  a  judgment  on  the  merits  of  the  claim  in \nquestion”); see also id. (noting that AEDPA “preserves the \npreexisting  law’s  recognition”  that  such  claims  are  “not \nsubject  to  statutory  and  common  law  restrictions  upon \nsuccessive petitions”). \nIn short, the abuse-of-the-writ principles expressly made \nrelevant by Slack and Martinez-Villareal do not require the \nfutile act of raising in a first federal habeas petition a claim \nknown to be unripe.  Thus AEDPA’s gatekeeping provisions \ndo not apply to Mr. Hill’s challenge, which was brought as \nsoon  as  the  signing  of  his  execution  warrant  caused  his \nconstitutional claim to ripen. \nThe Eleventh Circuit’s holding to the contrary is even \nmore troubling because the court characterized as second or \nsuccessive a constitutional claim that not only was previously \nunripe but also had no factual or legal predicate at all at the \ntime of Mr. Hill’s initial federal habeas proceeding.  Florida \ndid  not  enact  its  lethal  injection  statute  until  January  14, \n2000,  years  after  Mr.  Hill’s  federal  habeas  petition \nchallenging his current sentence was filed and, indeed, after \nthat denial became final.  See Hill v. Moore, 528 U.S. 1087 \n(Jan.  10,  2000)  (denying  certiorari).    Reading  the  habeas \nstatutes  (as  did  the  Eleventh  Circuit)  to  foreclose  even  a \n \n \n\n35 \nclaim that did not exist and could not possibly have been \nbrought  until  after  the  completion  of  an  inmate’s  earlier \nfederal  habeas  proceeding  has  no  colorable  basis  in  this \nCourt’s “abuse of the writ” jurisprudence, which provides the \nrelevant  context  here.    Felker,  518  U.S.  at  652  (citing \nMcCleskey); Slack, 529 U.S. at 486 (relying on “our prior \ndecisions  regarding  successive  petitions  and  abuse  of  the \nwrit” and citing McCleskey); Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. \n314, 324 (1996) (noting that “this Court has created careful \nrules for dismissal of petitions for abuse of the writ” (citing \nMcCleskey)).10 \nIt  is  no  surprise,  therefore,  that  the  Eleventh  Circuit \nstands  virtually  alone  in  adopting  a  complete  bar  on \nsubstantial  constitutional  claims  that  could  not  have  been \nraised during a first federal habeas proceeding.  See Singleton \nv. Norris, 319 F.3d 1018, 1023 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (“a \nhabeas petition raising a claim that had not arisen at the time \nof a previous petition is not barred by § 2244(b) or as an \nabuse of the writ”); see also In re Cain, 137 F.3d 234, 236-37 \n(5th Cir. 1998); Coe v. Bell, 209 F.3d 815, 823 (6th Cir. \n2000); James v. Walsh, 308 F.3d 162, 168 (2d Cir. 2002); see \nalso Allen v. Ornoski, No. Civ.50664FCDDAD, 2006 WL \n83384 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2006), aff’d, 435 F.3d 946 (9th Cir. \n2006),  cert.  denied,  126  S.  Ct.  1140  (2006);  Nguyen  v. \nGibson, 162 F.3d 600, 601 (10th Cir. 1998) (dismissing Ford \n                                                 \n10 As the lower courts have recognized, reading AEDPA to bar review of \nclaims that could not have been brought on first federal habeas would \nimplicate serious constitutional concerns under the Suspension Clause, \nand principles of constitutional avoidance, see Edward J. DeBartolo \nCorp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, \n575 (1988), thus provide yet another reason for rejecting the Eleventh \nCircuit’s approach.  See, e.g., James v. Walsh, 308 F.3d 162, 168 (2d Cir. \n2002) (Winter, J.) (“Denial of habeas relief in the present case may \nimplicate the Suspension Clause, because it would constitute a complete \ndenial of any collateral review of a claim that arose only after James filed \nhis 1997 petition.”). \n \n \n\n36 \nclaim that could have been raised in first habeas petition, but \nspecifically noting that it would be a different situation if the \ngrounds for the claim came to light only after the first federal \nhabeas petition was filed). \nThe Eleventh Circuit viewed this  case as lying at the \ncrossroads of habeas and § 1983, and held that the obstacles \nit perceived as blocking Hill’s route to habeas relief would \nsimilarly foreclose Hill from proceeding via § 1983.  That \nview led the court to the conclusion that the federal courts \nlack  jurisdiction  over  Hill’s  claim  because  it  is  the \n“functional equivalent of a successive habeas petition.” \nBut  the  Eleventh  Circuit’s  reasoning  was  doubly \nmisguided.  The prospect that a claim might be barred in \nhabeas is of no moment if the claim does not challenge the \n“fact or duration” or “validity” of the conviction or sentence \n(or the State’s authority to execute him using more humane \nlethal injection procedures).  See Dotson, 125 S. Ct. at 1247 \n(recognizing  “an  implied  exception  to  § 1983’s  coverage \nwhere the claim seeks – not where it simply ‘relates to’ – \n‘core’  habeas  relief,  i.e.,  where  a  state  prisoner  requests \npresent  or  future  release”).    District  courts  plainly  have \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction  to  consider  such  a  claim  in  a \n§ 1983 action. \nEqually  to  the  point,  the  fear  that  Hill  is  somehow \n“evading” an otherwise applicable habeas bar provides no \njustification  for  straining  to  recharacterize  Hill’s  § 1983 \naction.  The presentation of a recently ripened claim is not a \n“successive”  petition,  and  thus  nothing  in  § 2244(b)  or \nelsewhere  in  the  habeas  statutes  or  this  Court’s  habeas \njurisprudence  would  bar  Hill’s  Eighth  Amendment  claim \neven  if  it  were  presented  in  a  habeas  petition.    The  rule \ndeveloped by this Court that “§ 1983 must yield to the more \nspecific federal habeas statute with its attendant procedural \nand exhaustion requirements,” Nelson, 541 U.S. at 643, is \n“necessary to prevent inmates from doing indirectly . . . what \n \n \n\n37 \nthey could not do directly . . . – challenge the fact or duration \nof their confinement without complying with the procedural \nlimitations of the federal habeas statute,” id. at 647.  And \nwhere, as in Mr. Hill’s case, (1) a habeas petition containing \na  claim  would  comply  with  all  of  those  procedural \nlimitations, and (2) the claim does not “challenge the fact or \nduration of . . . [the petitioner’s] confinement, and (3) the \ninmate  presents  the  claim  in  a  § 1983  complaint  that \nmanifestly  states  a  cause  of  action  within  the  “literal \napplicability” of § 1983, Nelson, 541 U.S. at 643, there is \nsimply no reason to decline jurisdiction to hear the claim. \nIn short, the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that the district \ncourt  lacked  subject  matter  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  Mr. \nHill’s claim is meritless on every score. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nDONALD B.

The \nmanner in which the combination of drugs are administered \nto prisoners according to Florida’s lethal injection protocol, \nfails to comport with the minimum standards for the humane \neuthanization of animals in several respects.   \n \nThe  preferred  method  for  humane  euthanasia  by \nveterinarians involves the use of a single drug: an overdose of \nsodium pentobarbital.  Sodium pentobarbital is a stable and \nlong-lasting anesthetic, which places the patient in a deep – \nsurgical  plane2  of  –  anesthesia,  which  then  progresses  to \napnea as a result a respiratory depression, and then cardiac \n                                                 \n2   A surgical plane of anesthesia is defined as a level of anesthesia \ndeep  enough  to  ensure  that  a  surgical  patient  feels  no  pain  and  is \nunconscious for the duration of the surgical procedure.  \n  3    \n\narrest.  The advantages of such a method are speed of action; \nminimal  or  transient  pain  merely  associated  with  the \ninjection; and cost.  2000 Report of the American Veterinary \nMedical Association (“AVMA”) Panel on Euthanasia, 218 J. \nAm. Veterinary Med. Ass’n 669, 679-80 (March 1, 2001) \n(hereinafter, “AVMA Report”).   \n \nThe best available information about Florida’s current \nlethal injection protocol is that it calls for the injection of \nthree active drugs.  Two of these substances – pancuronium \nbromide, and potassium chloride –will cause severe pain and \nsuffering  when  administered  to  a  patient  who  is  not \nanesthetized to a surgical plane of anesthesia.   \n \nSpecifically, the inmate first is injected with at least \ntwo grams of sodium thiopental, which is an “ultra short-\nacting barbiturate” intended to anesthetize the inmate.  See \nSims v. State, 754 So.2d 657, 666 n.17 (Fla. 2000).  After \nreceiving saline solution to flush the injection apparatus, the \ninmate  is  injected  with  at  least  fifty  milligrams  of \npancuronium bromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent.  The \neffect of the pancuronium bromide is to paralyze the inmate’s \nvoluntary  muscles.    After  again  receiving  an  injection  of \nsaline solution, the inmate is finally administered at least one \nhundred  and  fifty  milliequivalents  of  potassium  chloride, \nwhich results in a fatal alteration in impulse generation in the \nheart, leading to cessation of cardiac activity and directly \ncausing the inmate’s death.   \n \nWhen  injected  into  an  unanaesthetized  –  or \ninadequately  anesthetized  –  patient,  potassium  chloride \ncauses pain and consequent suffering both upon injection and \nwhen death ultimately ensues.  For that reason, veterinary \nstandards require that if potassium chloride is used at all, a \npatient must first reach a surgical plane of anesthesia.   \n \n  4    \n\nWhile Florida’s lethal injection protocol provides for \nan initial injection of anesthetic, several factors create a real \npossibility  that  the  inmate  will  not  receive  adequate \nanesthesia  to  achieve  and  maintain  the  surgical  plane  of \nanesthesia  a  veterinarian  would  require  before  using \npotassium chloride to euthanize an animal.  First, the Florida \nprotocol does not allow for the assessment necessary under \nveterinary  standards  to  determine  if  a  surgical  plane  of \nanesthesia has been reached and maintained.   \n \nSecond, sodium thiopental is an “ultra short-acting \nbarbiturate,” which has the potential to wear off if any delays \noccur during the execution, or if the complete dosage is not \nproperly administered.  That does not occur in the euthanasia \nof animals where the individuals who administer the drugs \nare specifically trained to do so.    \n \nImportantly, Florida’s lethal injection protocol does \nnot  require  that  an  individual  trained  in  anesthesiology \ndetermine that the inmate is, in fact, fully unconscious prior \nto  injecting  pancuronium  bromide  or  potassium  chloride.  \nAgain, in the euthanasia of animals, there is constant contact \nwith the patient to assure the plane of anesthesia achieved \nand  maintained.    Unlike  standard  practice  in  veterinary \nmedicine, there is no requirement under the Florida lethal \ninjection protocol that the patient be observed for any period \nof time, or that executioners monitor or perform any tests on \nthe patient.  To the contrary, publicly available information \nregarding lethal injection procedures indicates that there is no \nobserver – much less a trained observer – in close enough \nproximity to the inmate to determine the plane of anesthesia.  \nIn contrast, a veterinarian euthanizing an animal accesses and \nevaluates  a  number  of  physiologic  parameters,  described \nmore fully herein, to ensure that the animal is anesthetized to \nan  appropriate  plane  of  surgical  anesthesia  prior  to \nadministering a drug that causes the animal’s death. \n \n  5    \n\nIn  addition,  the  use  of  pancuronium  bromide  is \nwholly  unnecessary,  and  not  approved  for  euthanasia  in \nveterinary  medicine,  alone  or  simultaneously  with  an \nanesthetic.    Pancuronium  bromide,  as  a  neuromuscular \ninhibitor, paralyzes the patient, and inhibits the ability of a \nveterinarian to determine the level of consciousness of the \npatient.  In addition, pancuronium bromide causes suffering \nin an inadequately anesthetized patient.  As a neuromuscular \nblocker, pancuronium bromide inhibits all of the patient’s \nvoluntary  muscular  functions,  including  breathing,  and \nultimately  causes the patient to suffocate.   If  a patient is \ninjected with pancuronium bromide before the patient has \nreached a surgical plane of anesthesia, the patient will suffer \nthe feeling of suffocation while conscious.   \n \nAs described more fully below, therefore, Florida’s \ndiscretionary procedures for lethal injection deviate in several \nrespects  from  the  minimum  standards  of  care  used  by \nveterinarians  to  provide  for  the  humane  euthanization  of \nanimals.  Based on the vast experience of veterinarians with \neuthanasia  and  the  drugs  involved  here,  the  information \nherein should assist courts in determining whether inmates \nsentenced  to  death  are  subjected  to  gratuitous  pain  and \nsuffering  during  the  execution  process  under  Florida’s \ncurrent protocol. \n \n  ARGUMENT \n \nI.  THE  PREFERRED  METHOD  OF  HUMANE \nEUTHANASIA  USED  BY  VETERINARIANS  IS \nTHE  USE  OF  SODIUM  PENTOBARBITAL \nALONE. \nThe preferred method of humane euthanasia used by \nveterinarians – and prescribed by Florida law – is the use of \nsodium  pentobarbital  without  any  additional  drugs.  \n  6    \n\nBarbiturates  generally  depress  the  central  nervous  system, \nwith loss of consciousness progressing to anesthesia.  With a \nsufficiently  large  overdose,  deep  anesthesia  progresses  to \napnea and then cardiac arrest. \n \n The  most  desirable  barbiturates  for  humane \neuthanasia are those that are potent, long-acting, stable in \nsolution and inexpensive.  The most prominent barbiturate \nmeeting  those  criteria  is  sodium  pentobarbital.    Use  of \nsodium pentobarbital results in rapid loss of consciousness \nand  minimal  or  transient  pain  associated  merely  with \ninsertion of the needle or injection.  AVMA Report at 679-\n80. \nConsistent with that view, Florida law provides: \nSodium  pentobarbital,  a  sodium  pentobarbital \nderivative,  or  other  agent  the  Board  of  Veterinary \nMedicine  may  approve  by  rule  shall  be  the  only \nmethods  used  for  euthanasia  of  dogs  and  cats  by \npublic or private agencies, animal shelters, or other \nfacilities which are operated for the collection and \ncare  of  stray,  neglected,  abandoned,  or  unwanted \nanimals. \nTitle XLVI Fla. Stat. ch. 828.058(1). \nThus, under Florida law, unless otherwise permitted \nby  rule  of  the  Board  of  Veterinary  Medicine,  humane \neuthanasia of dogs and cats is accomplished by the use of a \nsingle drug, sodium pentobarbital. \n  7    \n\n   \nII.  THE  PROTOCOL  FOR  USE  OF  POTASSIUM \nCHLORIDE IN FLORIDA EXECUTIONS FAILS \nTO COMPLY WITH MINIMUM VETERINARY \nSTANDARDS FOR HUMANE EUTHANASIA OF \nANIMALS. \nThe use of potassium chloride under the Florida lethal \ninjection protocol fails to comply with minimum veterinary \nstandards for the humane euthanasia of animals.  A potassium \nchloride  solution  for  intravenous  injection  contains  high \nconcentrations  of  potassium  and  chloride  ions,  which  can \ncause pain and consequent suffering in a patient following \nintravenous  injection.    Intravenous  injection  of  potassium \nchloride to a conscious patient causes severe pain due to the \npotassium-induced  irritation  of  the  inner  surfaces  of  the \nveins.    Specifically,  an  injection  of  potassium  chloride \nirritates  the  inner  walls  of  a  patient’s  veins,  which  are \nparticularly sensitive to potassium.  In animals, rippling of \nmuscle  tissue  and  clonic  spasms  have  been  observed \nfollowing an injection of potassium chloride.  AVMA Report \nat  681.    Potassium  chloride  ultimately  results  in  fatal \nalterations  in  impulse  generation  in  the  heart,  leading  to \ncessation of cardiac activity and death. \n \nBecause  potassium  chloride  causes  agony  to  an \nunanesthetized  patient,  AVMA  standards  provide  that \npotassium chloride may only be administered to a patient \nunder a surgical plane of anesthesia and that the anesthesia be \nadministered  by  someone  trained  and  knowledgeable  in \nanesthetic techniques: \n \nIt is of utmost importance that personnel performing \nthis  technique  are  trained  and  knowledgeable  in \nanesthetic techniques, and are competent in assessing \nanesthetic  depth  appropriate  for  administration  of \n  8    \n\npotassium chloride intravenously.  Administration of \npotassium chloride intravenously requires animals to \nbe in a surgical plane of anesthesia characterized by \nloss of consciousness, loss of reflex muscle response, \nand loss of response to noxious stimuli. \n \nAVMA Report at 680-81. \n \nUse  of  potassium  chloride  on  a  conscious  patient  is \n“unacceptable and absolutely condemned.”  AVMA Report at \n681.    An  execution  conforming  to  veterinary  standards, \ntherefore,  must  provide  that  an  inmate  is  administered  a \nsufficient quantity of anesthetic to remain unconscious at a \nsurgical plane of anesthesia through the potassium chloride \ninjection, and for the duration of the execution. \n \nA.  Sodium  Thiopental’s  Short-Acting  Nature \nPrecludes Or Limits Its Use In Veterinary \nEuthanasia. \nSodium  thiopental  is  considered  an  “ultra  short \nacting” barbiturate anesthetic.  Sims, 754 So.2d at 666, n. 17.  \nIn contrast, most veterinary euthanasias are performed using \nsodium pentobarbital (a stable and longer acting anesthetic), \nwhich is used both to induce anesthesia and to cause death.  \nIndeed, the AVMA standards for euthanasia indicate that the \nideal barbituric acid derivative for use in euthanasia should \nbe  potent,  long  acting,  stable  and  inexpensive.    AVMA \nReport at 680.  Sodium pentobarbital – not sodium thiopental \n– best fits that description.  Id.  Consistent with that mandate, \nabsent separate approval by the state Board of Veterinary \nMedicine, Florida’s animal euthanasia statute only allows for \nthe use of sodium pentobarbital or a sodium pentobarbital \nderivative for euthanasia of dogs and cats.  Title XLVI Fla. \nStat. ch. 828.058(1).   \nAs  observed  with  veterinary  patients,  sodium \n  9    \n\npentobarbital  rapidly  produces  unconsciousness  and  then \ncontinues to depress the areas of the brain responsible for \nrespiratory and cardiovascular control.  With one injection, \nthe patient rapidly progresses from a light to deep level of \nanesthesia and ultimately dies.   \nIf a short acting anesthetic, such as sodium thiopental, \nwere to be used for euthanasia of animals simply to induce \nanesthesia (as it is used in lethal injections), the veterinarian \nwould need to assess the depth of anesthesia and loss of \nconsciousness prior to administering any other drugs (such as \npotassium  chloride)  for  the  purpose  of  producing  death.  \nImportantly,  consciousness  must  be  assessed  by  a \nveterinarian  after  the  anesthetic  is  injected  and  prior  to \ninjection of any other drug.  A veterinarian would not make \nassumptions about consciousness without relying on a direct \nassessment of the patient and the patient’s vital signs. \n \nB.  Florida’s  Lethal  Injection  Protocol  Would \nNot  Allow  a  Veterinarian  to  Adequately \nEnsure That a Patient Was Unconscious to a \nSurgical Plane of Anesthesia. \nExamination  of  publicly  available  information \nregarding Florida’s lethal injection procedures shows that no \nsteps are taken to ensure that a surgical plane of anesthesia – \na prerequisite for administration of potassium chloride under \nveterinary standards – is achieved and maintained.  See, e.g., \nSims, 754 So. 2d at 666 n.17.  A surgical plane of anesthesia \nis described as “loss of consciousness, loss of reflex muscle \nresponse, and loss of response to noxious stimuli.”  AVMA \nReport at 681.  Use of potassium chloride on an animal that is \nnot  in  such  a  state  is  “unacceptable  and  absolutely \ncondemned” by the AVMA.  Id.   \nIn veterinary science, evaluating whether a patient has \nachieved an appropriate plane of anesthesia is both a science \n  10    \n\nand  an  art.    It  is  extremely  difficult  for  an  untrained \nindividual  to  appropriately  assess  a  patient’s  level  of \nunconsciousness,  and  veterinarians  rely  on  skill  and \nexperience to do so.  The observer must perform a variety of \ntests and have the ability to look for and perceive sometimes \nsubtle clues from the patient.  \nTypically,  a  veterinarian  (or  trained  assistant) \nmaintains  constant  contact  with  a  patient  throughout  the \nprocess of administering anesthesia.  In determining whether \nthe patient is sufficiently anesthetized, a veterinarian assesses \nthe  level  of  consciousness  by  direct  evaluation  of  the \npatient’s physiologic parameters (vital signs).  A veterinarian \nevaluates  the  patient’s  muscle  tone  and  the  level  of  the \npatient’s muscle relaxation.  A veterinarian should also locate \nthe patient’s pupils in orbit, and look for the presence or \nabsence of any eye movement.  The patient’s respiratory and \nheart rate must be monitored.  The veterinarian also tests the \npatient’s  reaction  to  stimuli  by  applying  mildly  painful \nstimuli  and  observing  any  movement  by  the  patient.  \nVeterinarians touch the patient to help assess these variables, \nas well as relying on monitors for data such as blood pressure \nand heart rate. \nSuch steps are necessary to ensure that the patient has \nreached the desired surgical plane of anesthesia, and require \nan experienced veterinarian to touch and observe the patient \nat close proximity.  The process of examining the patient \ntakes  several  minutes,  as  a  variety  of  factors  must  be \nconsidered. \nIn contrast, information available regarding Florida’s \nlethal injection protocol indicates that no provision is made \nfor  any  such  examination  of  an  inmate  during  the \nanesthetization process, much less by a physician or medical \nprofessional experienced in administering anesthesia.  There \nis no indication that any person remains in sufficiently close \n  11    \n\nproximity  to  the  inmate  to  perform  any  of  the  above-\ndescribed tests.  Evidence regarding similar lethal injection \nprocedures in other states expressly indicates that observers \nand  individuals  performing  the  lethal  injection  typically \nremain in a separate room, where they cannot even see the \ninmate during the execution.  Such complete disregard for the \neffectiveness of the anesthetic prior to injecting an inmate \nwith  potassium  chloride  falls  far  short  of  the  minimum \nstandards  and  applicable  veterinary  precautions  for  the \nhumane euthanasia of animals. \nFurthermore, anecdotal evidence regarding executions \nperformed  using  the  three-drug  combination  of  sodium \nthiopental,  pancuronium  bromide  and  potassium  chloride \nnearly identical to Florida’s lethal injection procedure shows \nthat in several cases, inmates seemed to retain consciousness \nthroughout the execution.  See, e.g., Beardslee v. Woodford, \n395  F.3d  1064,  1075  (9th  Cir.  2005)(several  California \ninmates seemed to remain conscious despite the purported \ninjection of five grams of sodium thiopental, as opposed to \nthe  two  grams  called  for  in  Florida’s  lethal  injection \nprotocol).    The  internal  survey  performed  by  the  Florida \nCorrections Commission prior to implementing the current \nlethal injection protocol expressly acknowledged that some \nrecipients of the three-drug combination underwent a “violent \nreaction  to  lethal  drugs,”  raising  grave  concerns  that  the \ninmates were not, in fact, fully anesthetized prior to receiving \neither  pancuronium  bromide  or  the  potassium  chloride \ninjections.  Florida Corrections Commission, Supplemental \nReport  –  Methods  of  Execution  Used  by  States  (1997) \n(hereinafter,  “FCC  Report”)  at  10  (available  at \nhttp://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/reports.html).   \nFinally, proper veterinary procedure demands that a \nveterinarian  administering  euthanasia  solution  to  a  patient \nensure that all of the euthanasia solution was delivered to the \npatient’s  vein.    Sodium  thiopental  must  be  properly \n  12    \n\nadministered  intravenously,  which  can  be  extremely \ndifficult—indeed, impossible – for an untrained individual.  \nIf the anesthetic is not properly mixed and injected directly \ninto  the  patient’s  vein,  the  medication  will  leak  into \nsurrounding  tissue,  and  lessen  the  effectiveness  of  the \nintended dosage.   \nThe  FCC  Report  notes  that  “difficulty  locating  a \nviable  vein  to  establish  the  intravenous  connection”  is  a \ncommon problem in lethal injections.  FCC Report at 10.  \nOther  cited  problems  include  the  tightness  of  the  leather \nstraps around the inmate, which may lead to problems in \ncirculation of the lethal injection drugs, and clogging of the \ntubes carrying the drugs because of the mixture of two or \nmore of the solutions, and necessitating the replacement of \nthe  tubes  during  the  execution.    Id.    Finally,  evidence \nobtained  in  autopsies  performed  on  inmates  executed \npursuant to Florida’s lethal injection statute is inconsistent \nwith effective delivery of all drugs to the inmates.  At least \nthree inmates (of 16 executed by lethal injection in Florida) \nsuffered  through  lengthy  executions  marked  by  errors  in \nobtaining correct insertion to a vein, and several puncture \nwounds on the inmates. \nGiven the myriad of potential problems created by the \ncomplex  lethal  injection  procedure,  the  administration  of \ndrugs by inexperienced personnel with inadequate training \nonly increases the risk that the sodium thiopental anesthetic \nwill not be properly delivered to the inmate, and that the \nexecution will not proceed under humane conditions, as the \ninmate  will  remain  inadequately  anesthetized  or  even \nconscious during the administration of potassium chloride.  \nWithout providing for careful monitoring of an inmate’s level \nof consciousness, Florida’s lethal injection protocol falls far \nshort  of  the  precautions  required  in  humane  veterinary \neuthanasia.     \n  13    \n\nIII.  THE USE OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKERS \nIN  THE  FLORIDA  LETHAL  INJECTION \nPROTOCOL  IS  CONTRARY  TO  HUMANE \nVETERINARY  EUTHANASIA  AND  MASKS \nCONSCIOUSNESS. \nThe  use  of  neuromuscular  blockers  in  the  Florida \nlethal injection protocol is unnecessary, contrary to humane \nveterinary euthanasia and adds risk to the procedure because \nthe drug masks consciousness.  Pancuronium bromide is a \nneuromuscular  agent  that  completely  paralyzes  a  patient’s \nvoluntary  muscles.    Veterinarians  do  not  typically  use \npancuronium bromide or any other neuromuscular blocking \nagent when euthanizing animals and the AVMA has severely \nlimited its use.   \nPancuronium  bromide  masks  indicia  of  pain  or \nconsciousness in the patient during the euthanization process, \nand  causes  a  conscious  patient  to  suffer  by  experiencing \nsuffocation. \nA.  Pancuronium Bromide Inhibits The Ability \nTo Assess The Patient’s Consciousness. \nThe muscle paralysis caused by pancuronium bromide \nmasks indicia of consciousness, making it even more difficult \nfor  observers  to  ascertain  whether  the  patient  is  properly \nanesthetized.  As described above, determining whether  a \npatient has achieved a surgical plane of anesthesia involves \ncareful  observation,  including  observation  of  the  patient’s \nmuscle movements and response to stimuli.  Paralyzing the \npatient  makes  it  far  more  difficult  for  a  veterinarian  to \neffectively determine the patient’s level of consciousness.   \nPancuronium  bromide  does  not  contribute  to \nanesthesia or unconsciousness.  It is not an anesthetic, pain \nkiller  or  an  analgesic.    The  use  of  pancuronium  bromide \n  14    \n\ncould create the impression that a patient is unconscious, \ncalm or serene when the patient is actually in extreme pain or \nsuffering. \nB.  Pancuronium Bromide Causes A Conscious \nPatient To Experience Suffocation. \nUse  of  pancuronium  bromide  following  the \nadministration of a short-acting anesthetic such as sodium \nthiopental  increases  the  probability  that  the  patient  will \nendure pain or mental distress prior to death.  Specifically, if \nthe  pancuronium  bromide  takes  effect  before  the  patient \nreaches a surgical plane of anesthesia as a result of sodium \nthiopental, a veterinary patient would be aware of the need to \nbreathe, the inability to do so and the terrifying experience of \nsuffocation.   \nAs a result, Florida’s euthanasia statute provides that \n“any substance which acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent \n. . . may not be used on a dog or cat for any purpose,” except \nwhere  “an  emergency  situation  exists  which  requires  the \nimmediate euthanasia of an injured, diseased, or dangerous \nanimal.”  Title XLVI Fla.

Its \nonly effect is to mask any suffering endured by the patient \nand to interfere with an assessment of consciousness.  Its use \nas contemplated by the Florida lethal injection protocol is \ncontrary to veterinary standards and humane euthanasia of \nanimals.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Veterinary Amici \nrespectfully submit that the protocol for execution by lethal \ninjection, as presently articulated by the State of Florida, fails \nto comport with veterinary standards for humane euthanasia. \n \nMarch 3, 2006     Respectfully submitted, \n \nIra S.

The organization \nfocuses particularly on the role of the medical community in \nadvancing human rights. It has sought to assure that public \n\n2 \npolicies,  including criminal justice policies,  are consistent \nwith knowledge  of medicine and public  health.  In 1997, \nPhysicians for Human Rights shared the Nobel Peace Prize \nas one of the original steering committee members of the \nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines. \nGlobal  Lawyers  and  Physicians  (\"GLP\"),  founded  in \n1996,  is  a  non-profit  nongovernmental  organization  that \nfocuses  on  health  and  human  rights  issues.  GLP  was \nformed  to  reinvigorate the collaboration of the legal and \nmedicaVpublic  health  professions  to  protect  the  human \nrights and dignity of all persons.  GLP works at the local, \nnational, and international levels on issues with a focus on \nhealth  and  human  rights,  patient  rights,  and  human \nexperimentation. \nDr. Lawrence Egbert, formerly professor of anesthesi \nology at University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, \nis now a professor of anesthesiology at The Johns Hopkins \nUniversity.  Dr.  Egbert, the  President of Physicians  for \nSocial Responsibility of Baltimore, has provided anesthe \nsiology services on four Doctors Without Borders missions, \nin Sri Lanka,  Lebanon, and  Kosovo.  He is  a  nationally \nrecognized expert on the administration of lethal injection, \nand has testified in previous lethal injection cases \nDr. Jonathan Groner is a clinical associate professor of \nsurgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine \nand  Public  Health,  the  medical  director  of the  Trauma \nProgram at Columbus Children's Hospital, and a pediatric \nsurgeon with  a  busy  clinical  practice.  He  also  teaches \nmedical students, residents, and allied health professionals \nabout surgery, trauma and injury prevention.  Since 1997, \nDr.  Groner  has  written  numerous  articles  about  lethal \ninjection. \nDr. Andrew Gumbs attended college and medical school \nat Yale  University.  As  a  medical  student,  he  received  2 \nresearch fellowships to perform work on Chagas Disease in \n\n3 \nBrazil. He performed his general surgery residency at the \nYa le-N ew  Haven  Hospital  where  he  was  awarded  the \nResident Teaching award in his Chief year and was named \nthe Best Surgical Resident. He performed a 2 year clinical \nand research fellowship in Pancreatic Surgery at the Uni \nversity of Verona in Italy under the auspices of the Italian \nMinistry  of  Health.  He  is  currently  a  Minimal  Access \nSurgery Fellow and Instructor in Surgery at New York \nPresbyterian Hospital and has authored over 25 published \nmanuscripts and one book chapter.  He is a member of the \nSociety of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons, \nthe  International  Hepato  Pancreato  Biliary  Association, \nand  the  Society of Laparoendoscopic  Surgeons,  and  has \nspoken at multiple national and international meetings. \nAmici, including the members of PHR and GLP, have \nextensive  experience  in  medicine,  particularly  anesthesi \nology, as well as the use of IV tubing, catheters, and the \nadministration and effects of the intravenous drugs used in \nlethal  injection.  As  members  of  the  anesthesiology \ncommunity and the medical community in general, amici \nhave  a  strong  interest  in  the  proper  administration  of \nintravenous drugs in patients, and a unique familiarity with \nand understanding of the scientific issues involved.  Amici \nwrite in the hope that their expertise may be of assistance \nto  the  Court,  particularly  in  understanding  that  an \nassessment of the likelihood of excruciating pain caused by \nlethal  injection  requires  an  intensive,  individualized \nassessment  of  the  protocol,  equipment,  knowledge,  ex \nperience, and skills to be applied in each case. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nAmici  take  no  position  regarding  the  procedural \nquestion  in  this  case.  And  amici  do  not  address  the \nultimate  legal  issue  whether  the  execution  of any  con \ndemned inmate by lethal injection violates the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the United States Consti-\n\n4 \ntution.  However, underlying the procedural issue raised in \nthis matter are medical and technical issues about which \namici  care  very  deeply,  to  which  amici  have  devoted \nsubstantial research, and with respect to which amici have \nsignificant expertise. \nThe combination of chemicals administered by the state \nof Florida to execute condemned inmates-i.e., the sequen \ntial intravenous administration of sodium thiopental, pancu \nronium bromide and potassium chloride-is widely used by \nthe United States jurisdictions that execute condemned in \nmates by lethal injection.  If administered improperly, this \ncombination  of  chemicals  would  cause  an  inmate  to \nsuffocate, while consciously experiencing the blinding pain \nof an injection of potassium chloride and a coronary arrest, \nwhile  onlookers  believe  him  to  be  unconscious  and \ninsensitive to any pain.  Yet all across the country, state \nlethal injection protocols fail to provide execution personnel \nthe adequate training, appropriate procedures, and proper \nequipment  necessary  to  administer  lethal  injection. \nInstead,  current  state  lethal  injection  protocols  are  so \ndeficient  in  guidance  that they  create  a  significant  and \ngratuitous likelihood that some inmates will unnecessarily \nsuffer horrible pain. \nSTATEMENT \nPetitioner Clarence Edward Hill was convicted of mur \nder and sentenced to death by the Florida state courts.  See \nHill v. State, 643 So. 2d 1071 (Fla. 1994).  He subsequently \nfiled  a complaint under 42  U.S.C.  §  1983 alleging that in \nexecuting him by means of the sequential intravenous ad \nministration  of sodium  thiopental,  pancuronium  bromide \nand potassium chloride, the respondents, acting under color \nof Florida law, will cause, or create a foreseeable risk of \ncausing, the unnecessary and wanton  infliction of pain in \nbringing about his death.  This Court granted certiorari in \norder  to  determine  whether  such  a  claim  is  properly \n\n5 \nbrought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or in a petition for a writ of \nhabeas corpus. \nAmici take no position in this action regarding the pro \ncedural question in this case.  And amici do not address the \nultimate  legal  issue  whether  the  execution  of any  con \ndemned inmate by lethal injection violates the Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause of the United States Consti \ntution.  However, underlying the procedural issue raised in \nthis matter are medical and technical issues about which \namici  care  very  deeply,  to  which  amici  have  devoted \nsubstantial research, and with respect to which amici have \nsignificant expertise. \nThirty-eight states, along with the federal government \nand the  United States military, authorize capital punish \nment, and all but one of these jurisdictions authorizes exe \ncution  by  lethal  injection. 1  See  Capital  Punishment \nStatistics, U.S. Dep't. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statis \ntics, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cp.htm (last visited Mar. \n2, 2006).  Well over 80% of all executions carried out in this \ncountry since 1976-inc1uding 98%  of all executions since \nJanuary 1, 2000-have been effected by lethal injection. \nThe combination of chemicals administered by the state \nof Florida to execute condemned inmates-i.e., the sequen \ntial intravenous administration of sodium thiopental, pancu \nronium bromide and potassium chloride-is widely used by \nthe United States jurisdictions that execute condemned in \nmates by lethal injection.  See Abdur'Rahman v. Bredesen, \n181 S.W.3d 292, 307 (Tenn. 2005) (\"the undisputed evidence \nbefore the Chancellor was that only two states do not use \nsome combination\" of these chemicals in lethal injection). \nIf improperly administered, this combination of chemicals \nwill cause inhuman suffering on the part of the inmate prior \n1 Nebraska requires execution by electrocution.  See Neb. Rev. Stat. \n§ 29-2543 (2005). \n\n6 \nto his death.  And the procedures by which lethal injection \nis administered in jurisdictions across the country create a \nsignificant and unnecessarily high likelihood that the three \ndrug  procedure  will  be  administered  in  a  manner  that \ncauses such suffering on the part of at least some inmates \nprior to their death. \nBoth sodium thiopental and pancuronium bromide can \ncause respiratory arrest and be lethal, but the injection of \npotassium  chloride  shortly after the  injection  of sodium \nthiopental and pancuronium bromide normally ensures that \ndeath occurs  by cardiac arrest before  respiratory arrest \noccurs.  Thus, in all lethal injection jurisdictions, potassium \nchloride is the agent intended to bring about the inmate's \ndeath.  Sodium thiopental is administered as an anesthetic, \nand pancuronium bromide is administered for \"cosmetic\" or \n\"aesthetic\" reasons; i.e., to make the prisoner appear se \nrene. \nIn the doses  and concentrations in which it is  admini \nstered in the lethal injection process, potassium chloride \nis-absent adequate anesthesia-indescribably painful.  It \n\"scours the nerve fibers lining [the inmate's] veins,\" Evans \nv. Saar, No. L-06-149, 2006 WL 274476, at *1 (D. Md. Feb. \n1,  2006)  and  interrupts  the  heart's  signaling  function, \ninterfering with  its  rhythmic  contractions  and  causing a \nmassive coronary arrest.  Administering this quantity of \npotassium  chloride  to  a  conscious  individual  would,  in \naddition to precipitating a painful coronary arrest, result in \nan excruciating burning pain, extending from the site of the \ninjection (normally an arm, hand, leg or foot) to the heart, \nand would constitute the most severe form of torture. \nThe administration of pancuronium bromide during the \nlethal injection process greatly increases the likelihood that \nthe inmate will suffer agonizing pain.  Although it makes \nthe inmate incapable of any voluntary movement, and even \nof breathing, pancuronium bromide has no  effect whatso-\n\n7 \never on awareness, cognition or sensation.2  As a result, an \nindividual to whom pancuronium bromide has been admi \nnistered, but who is not properly anesthetized, will endure \nthe terror of conscious paralysis, with no ability to struggle \nor communicate to anyone else that he is conscious and feels \npain.  An inmate undergoing lethal injection to whom pan \ncuronium bromide has been administered, and who is  not \nproperly anesthetized, would suffocate while experiencing \n(consciously) the blinding pain of an injection of potassium \nchloride  and  a  massive  heart  attack,  while  onlookers \nbelieved him to be unconscious and insensitive to any pain. \nAlthough an inmate who is properly anesthetized will not \nconsciously experience the pain and terror associated with \ninjections of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride, \ntheir injection into  the veins  of an individual who  is  not \nsufficiently  anesthetized  would  cause  horrible  suffering. \nTherefore, unless the inmate is brought to an appropriate \nanesthetic depth by the injection of sodium thiopental, and \nunless that depth is  maintained throughout the lethal in \njection process, the inmate will endure savage torment. \nHowever,  achieving  and  maintaining  an  appropriate \nanesthetic  depth is  an extraordinarily complex endeavor, \nwhich  requires  specialized  training,  procedures  and \nequipment.  If adequately trained personnel, appropriate \nprocedures  and  proper  equipment  are  not  employed \nthroughout the lethal injection process, there is a significant \nlikelihood  that tremendous  agony  will  be  inflicted  upon \nsome inmates in the course of any significant number of \nexecutions.  Although different lethal injection jurisdictions \nuse different procedures, and many are loathe to disclose \nthose procedures, see Deborah Denno, When Legislatures \nDelegate Death: The Troubling Paradox Behind State Uses \nPancuronium bromide is used to prevent involuntary movement by \n2 \ncertain surgical patients, who are anesthetized and whose breathing \nand ventilation are accomplished artificially. \n\n8 \nOf Electrocution And Lethal Injection And What It Says \nAbout  Us,  63  Ohio  St.  L.J.  63,  116-17  (2002),  the  lethal \ninjection procedures in use in at least some jurisdictions, by \nfailing to provide for appropriate training, procedures and \nequipment, make it inevitable that some inmates will suffer \ninhuman, and entirely unnecessary, pain. \nARGUMENT \nLethal Injection Procedures In Use In The United States \nCreate  A  Significant  Likelihood  That  Condemned \nInmates Will Not Be Properly Anesthetized During The \nLethal Injection Process. \nSodium thiopental is  a barbiturate used by anesthesio \nlogists to anesthetize patients temporarily, in order to per \nmit sufficient time  to  intubate the  trachea and  institute \nmechanical support of ventilation and respiration.  Once this \nhas  been achieved,  additional  drugs  are administered  to \nmaintain a level of anesthesia deep enough to ensure that \nthe patient feels no pain and is unconscious for the duration \nof a  surgical  procedure.  The  medical  utility  of sodium \nthiopental  derives  from  its  short-acting properties  when \nadministered in smaller doses:  if unanticipated obstacles \nhinder  or  prevent  successful  intubation,  patients  will \nquickly  regain consciousness  and will  resume  ventilation \nand respiration on their own. \nIf the dose of sodium thiopental normally administered \nin lethal injection is, in fact, successfully delivered to the in \nmate's circulatory system, it is unlikely that the inmate will \nretain or regain consciousness.  However, if that dose is not \nsuccessfully  delivered,  the  inmate  may  retain  or  regain \nconsciousness  prior to  death, and experience the horrific \npain of injections of pancuronium bromide and potassium \nchloride. \nThe intravenous administration of any anesthetic, includ \ning sodium thiopental, is  a complex task, involving many \nsteps and many opportunities for problems to thwart the \n\n9 \ndelivery of the intended dose.  It requires substantial train \ning and proficiency, but lethal injection jurisdictions in the \nUnited  States  often  fail  to  specify  the  training  and \nproficiency  required  of the  personnel  assigned  to  admi \nnister sodium thiopental, or assign the task to  personnel \nwith no training or expertise.  In addition, the lethal injec \ntion procedures used in those jurisdictions create a further \nlikelihood  that a  condemned  inmate will  not  receive  the \nnecessary dose of sodium thiopental, and as a result, will \nnot be properly anesthetized prior to receiving injections of \npancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. \nExecution logs  and  eyewitness  accounts  of executions \nsuggest  that  the  likelihood  of failure  inherent  in  lethal \ninjection protocols is  neither theoretical nor remote.  For \nexample,  execution  records  in  California  reveal  that, \nalthough sodium thiopental doses  in that jurisdiction are \ncalculated to  render the inmate unconscious and to cease \nrespiration, six inmates executed from  1999-2006  did  not \nstop breathing until after or at the time of the pancuronium \nbromide injection.  See Morales v. Hickman, No. 06-219 JF, \n2006 WL 335427, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14,2006). \nAlthough even ideal procedures cannot eliminate entirely \nthe mis-administration of anesthesia, standard procedures \nhave been developed over time in order to minimize those \nrisks.  By deviating from those standard procedures, often \nsignificantly and without justification, lethal injection pro \ntocols  currently in use make it inevitable that, over any \nlarge  number  of  executions,  some  inmates  will  suffer \nexcruciating pain.  Thus, the instances in which that occurs \nare  not  \"unforeseeable  accidents,\"  but  the  predictable \nresult  of  poorly-designed  procedures  implemented  by \nunqualified personnel. \n\n10 \nA.  Preparation and Dosage \nSodium thiopental has a short shelf life in liquid form.  It \nis distributed in powdered form to increase its shelf life, and \nmust be mixed into a liquid solution before use.  As a result, \nexecution  personnel  must  first  prepare  the  sodium \nthiopental  for  intravenous  delivery.  This  preparation \nrequires the application of pharmaceutical knowledge and \nfamiliarity with applicable terminology and abbreviations. \nWithout detailed  and  specific  instructions  stating exactly \nhow to formulate the sodium thiopental, there is a needless \nincrease  in  the  likelihood  that  an  inadequately  trained \nexecutioner will mistakenly prepare the wrong dose. \nMoreover,  the  effect  of  an  intravenous  injection  of \nsodium thiopental depends upon the interplay of a complex \nset  of  factors,  including,  for  example,  the  rate  of \nadministration of the  drugs,  the  rate  of delivery of any \nintervening flush solutions and the relative timing of the \ndelivery  of the  drugs.  Where  sodium  thiopental  is  not \nprepared and administered by qualified individuals, who are \nable to observe the inmate and determine the effectiveness \nof sodium thiopental, in order to ensure that it brings about \na  deep,  lengthy anesthetized  state,  and  that the  inmate \nremains in that state throughout the execution, the inmate \nmay lose consciousness for only a brief period, leaving him \nsensible  to  the  horrific  pain  resulting  from  the \nadministration  of  potassium  chloride,  but  unable  to \ncommunicate  that pain to  those  administering the  lethal \ninjection because of the paralyzing effect of pancuronium \nbromide. \nB.  Administration \nSodium thiopental's principal use is  in the induction of \nanesthesia.  Once this has been achieved, additional drugs \nare administered to maintain a \"surgical depth\" or \"surgical \nplane\" of anesthesia (i.e., a level of anesthesia deep enough \nto  ensure  that  a  surgical  patient  feels  no  pain  and  is \n\n11 \nunconscious  for  the  duration of the  surgical  procedure). \nThe medical utility of sodium thiopental derives from  its \nshort-acting properties when administered in small doses: \nif  unanticipated  obstacles  hinder  or  prevent  successful \nintubation  (securing  the  airway  with  a  breathing tube), \npatients will quickly regain consciousness and will resume \nventilation and respiration on their own. \nHowever,  these  benefits  of sodium  thiopental  in  the \noperating room  are  not only  unnecessary,  but engender \nserious risks, in the execution chamber.  Other anesthetics \nare available, the effects of which are far more prolonged \nthan sodium thiopental, and their use would  minimize or \neliminate the risk that an anesthetized inmate would regain \nconsciousness during the lethal injection process. \nBut if sodium thiopental is to be used in lethal injection, \nand  if it is  not administered  in  a  large  enough  dose  to \nensure continued and sustained unconsciousness during the \nadministration  of  pancuronium  bromide  and  potassium \nchloride,  it should  be  administered  continuously  to  the \ninmate.  See  David  Kravets,  \"California altering lethal \ninjection  protocol,\"  Associated  Press,  Mar.  3,  2006 \n(reporting  that  California  prison  officials  are  changing \nlethal  injection  protocol  to  provide  for  continuous \nadministration of anesthetic).  However, the lethal injection \nprotocols in use in at least some lethal injection jurisdictions \nfail  to  provide  for  the  continuous  intravenous \nadministration of sodium thiopental.  For example, while an \nOklahoma statute requires that \"[t]he punishment of death \nmust be inflicted by continuous, intravenous administration \nof a  lethal  quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate,\" \nOkla. Stat. tit. 22, §1014 (2003), the Florida protocol states \nthat only  \"[t]he  first  two  syringes\" will  contain  sodium \nthiopental.  Sims v.  State, 754  So. 2d 657, 665  n.17 (Fla. \n2000).  The failure to administer a continuous infusion of \nsodium thiopental may create a significant, but completely \navoidable  and  therefore  unnecessary,  risk  that  the \n\n12 \ncondemned inmate will regain consciousness after receiving \nsodium  thiopental,  and  consciously  experience  muscular \nparalysis, without loss of consciousness or sensation, during \nthe  excruciating  pain  of  both  suffocation  and  the \nintravenous injection of potassium chloride. \nC.  IV Equipment \nPrior to execution, the condemned inmate is secured to a \ngurney or table with restraints to the ankles, wrists, and \nchest.  If-as is  often  the  case  in  lethal  injection-the \npersonnel administering the drugs are not at the recipient's \n\"bedside,\" but are instead in a different room, see Morales \nv. Hickman, No. 06-219-JF, (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21,2006) (order \ngranting  defendant's  motion  to  proceed  with  execution \nunder alternative procedures as condition to order denying \npreliminary injunction) (noting that \"having a person in the \nexecution  chamber  is  contrary to  departmental  policy\"); \nAbdur'Rahman,  181  S.W.3d  at  301  (\"[tJhe  executioner \nremains  in  a  room  adjacent  to  the  death  chamber\"); \nSupplemental  Report:  Methods  of  Execution  Used  by \nStates,  Florida Corrections Commission,3 (June 20, 1997), \nat  8-9,  available  at  http://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/ \nmethods/emstates.html (\"Florida Report\") (finding that in \nLouisiana  and  Missouri,  the  executioner  is  in  a  room \nseparate from the inmate), intravenous tubes lead from the \ninmate in the execution chamber, through a wall or under a \ncurtain,  and  into  an  adjacent  room,  where  personnel \nadminister the execution.  Multiple IV extension sets, and \nadditional components and connections, may be required to \nreach from the prisoner to the adjacent room. \nThe  Florida  Corrections  Commission  was  established  by  the \n3 \nFlorida Legislature to provide oversight to  Florida's correctional \nsystem  and  provide  policy  and  budget  recommendations  to  the \nFlorida  Governor  and  Legislature.  See  Florida  Corrections \nCommission Welcome Page, http://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc (last visited \nMar. 2, 2006). \n\n13 \nAn  \"IV  setup\"  consists  of  multiple  components \nincluding not only the lines, but also  stopcocks, injection \nports, etc.-that are assembled by hand prior to use.  Any \nof the connections between the IV components may loosen \nand leak.  See Brian Witte, \"Triple murderer in Maryland \nexecuted after Supreme Court rejects last-ditch appeals,\" \nAssociated  Press,  June  18,  2004  (Maryland  officials \nacknowledged that IV line used to deliver lethal injection to \nTyrone Gilliam in 1998 leaked).  And the use of additional \nIV tubing and components increases the likelihood of leaks \nand kinks.  Therefore, in clinical practice, it is important to \nmaintain visual surveillance of the entirety of the IV setup \nso that any leaks or kinks can be detected.  The relative \npositions of the inmate and the personnel administering the \nlethal injection not only increase the likelihood of leaks, by \nrequiring additional IV tubing and components, but may \nalso  preclude  such  surveillance,  making  it  difficult  or \nimpossible to detect leaks.  This problem may be exacer \nbated where a sheet or other covering is placed over any \nportion of the IV setup, including any portion physically \nattached to the inmate.  See Sara Rimer, \"In the Busiest \nDeath  Chamber,  Duty  Carries  Its  Own  Burdens,\"  N.Y. \nTimes, Dec. 17,2000 (describing Texas inmate about to be \nexecuted as strapped to gurney under a sheet). \nIn addition, an IV setup may include a \"stopcock,\" which \nis a device used to provide access for the administration of \nsolutions, and to regulate their directional flow to a patient's \nvascular system.  A valve on the stopcock can be opened \nand closed to permit or restrict flow.  Many stopcocks are \ndesigned in such a manner that it is not readily apparent \nwhether a valve is open or closed, and the error of retro \ngrade injection (in which a closed valve causes an injected \nsolution to \"back up\" in the IV system, diluting the drug \nbeing injected and causing it to take a very long time to \nreach the vascular system) is  well known in practice.  A \nretrograde injection can also occur where an injection port \n\n14 \nis used without a stopcock, because many individuals (and \nparticularly  those  who  lack  appropriate  training)  are \nunaware that in that case, the IV tubing must be pinched or \nkinked upstream from the injection site. \nWhere a leak or retrograde injection occurs, the inmate \nmay  receive  a  dose  of sodium  thiopental  insufficient  to \nrender him unconscious, or to prevent him from regaining \nconsciousness, before the injection of pancuronium bromide \nand potassium chloride.  However, the inmate may never \ntheless still receive a dose of pancuronium bromide suffi \ncient to  paralyze  him,  and  a  dose  of potassium  chloride \nsufficient to cause unendurable pain. \nD.  Injection \nConsistent with clinical practice, the chemicals admini \nstered  during lethal  injection  are  typically  administered \nthrough catheters, small needles with hollow tubes inserted \ninto  the  inmate's  vein.  If the  catheter is  not  properly \ninserted  in the  inmate's  vein,  or if it moves  after being \ninserted, sodium thiopental will not enter the vein, but will \nenter the tissue surrounding it, and will not be delivered to \nthe inmate's central nervous system, and will not render \nhim unconscious.  This condition, known as infiltration, can \nalso occur if the wall of the vein is perforated or weakened \nduring insertion of the  catheter,  or if the  chemicals  are \ninjected with excessive pressure. \nInfiltration occurs with regularity in the clinical setting, \nand  requires  continuous  surveillance  of  the  IV  site, \npreferably by the individual performing the injection, so as \nto permit correlation between visual observation and tactile \nfeedback from the syringe plunger.  Where, as may be the \ncase  in  the  lethal  injection  setting,  the  individual \nadministering the injection is not located in close proximity \nto  the  inmate,  or  where  the  injection  site  is  covered, \ninfiltration will  go  undetected  and uncorrected, in which \ncase the inmate might not be sufficiently anesthetized by \n\n15 \nthe injection of sodium thiopental to ensure that he is not \nconscious  when  pancuronium  bromide  and  potassium \nchloride are injected. \nMoreover,  absorption  of the  chemicals  being  admini \nstered  can  be  hindered  if catheters  are  inserted  in  the \nwrong  direction-i.e.,  directing  flow  away  from  the \ninmate's heart.  See Denno, supra, 63 Ohio St. L.J. at 110. \nFor example,  the  1990  execution  of Charles  Walker  in \nIllinois was prolonged when execution personnel inserted \nthe intravenous needle pointing towards Walker's fingers, \ninstead of his  heart.  \"Niles  Group  Questions  Execution \nProcedure,\" United Press International, Nov. 8, 1992. \nE.  Other Problems \nLethal  injection  procedures  in  use  in  various \njurisdictions create a variety of other opportunities for the \nfailure  to  achieve  and maintain the  necessary anesthetic \ndepth.  For example, lethal injection protocols may fail to \nspecify the timing of the injections to be given the inmate, \nand since sodium thiopental is  a  short-acting barbiturate \nwhen administered in small doses, it may cease to be effec \ntive if there is too long a delay between its administration \nand that of pancuronium bromide or potassium chloride. \nAs  currently devised,  lethal injection protocols  fail  to \naddress  the  essential  step  of assessing anesthetic  depth \nfollowing  the  administration  of  sodium  thiopental.  A \nphysical  or tactile  examination  is  particularly  important \nbecause,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  inmate  will  not \nexperience the pain of the injection of pancuronium bromide \nand potassium chloride, he must be in a surgical plane of \nanesthesia  characterized  not  merely  by  loss  of \nconsciousness, but by \"loss of reflex muscle response and \nloss of response to noxious stimuli.\"  See 2000 Report of the \nPanel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation,  218  Journal  of  the  American  Veterinary \nMedical Association 669, at 681 (Mar. 1, 2001), available at \n\n16 \nhttp://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/euthanasia.pdf  (discussing \nstandards  for  euthanasia  of animals).  The  danger that \nobvious signs that an appropriate level of anesthetic depth \nhas not been achieved may be missed is particularly great \nwhere, as in most, if not all, lethal injection jurisdictions, the \nperson  administering  the  lethal  chemicals  is  physically \nseparate from the inmate. \nF.  Training and Qualification \nThe opportunities for failure to  deliver an appropriate \ndose of anesthetic described above make manifest the need \nfor  particularized  determinations  of  whether  execution \npersonnel  possess  adequate  training  and  proficiency  to \nadminister  lethal  injections  in  order  to  prevent  what \notherwise would  be  unbearable  suffering.  The  need  for \nsuch assessments is especially acute in view of the fact that \nlethal  injection  protocols  in  use  in  the  United  States \ntypically fail to specify the training and proficiency required \nof such personnel, see Abdur'Rahman, 181 S.W.3d at 301 \n(finding that the warden prepares the syringes, but with no \nfinding  as  to  the warden's  ability or training to  do  so); \nDenno, supra, 63 Ohio St. L.J. at 121 (noting that protocols \nof only fourteen states mention \"training,\" \"competency,\" \n\"preparation\" or \"practice,\" and that those that do  fail to \nindicate  what  type  of  training  is  required);  see  also \nAdministrative  Directive,  Procedure  for  Execution, \nArkansas  Department  of  Correction,  May  23,  1996 \n(\"Arkansas  Protocol\")  (stating  only  that  \"orientation,  if \nneeded ... will  be ... provided  by  the  Director  [of  the \nDepartment of Correction],\" but providing no standard for \nor description of training);  Administrative Regulation 300-\n14,  Colorado  Department  of  Correction,  June  15,  2004 \n(\"Colorado  Protocol\")  (requiring only  that the  executive \ndirector of the Department of Correction will \"ensure\" the \nstaff is properly trained, but providing no standard for or \ndescription of training required);  Florida Report, at 8, 10 \n(finding  that  \"there  are  no  written  procedures\"  in \n\n17 \nLouisiana, and that in Oklahoma, execution personnel \"are \nnot required to be medically trained\") and lethal injection \njurisdictions  generally  refuse  to  identify  the  personnel \ninvolved  in  performing  the  executions.  See  Arkansas \nProtocol;  Colorado  Protocol;  see  also  Florida  Report \n(finding executioner's  identity is  kept secret in  Georgia, \nOklahoma and Virginia). \nAs noted above, amici do  not suggest that the partici \npation of an anesthesiologist or other physician is necessary \nin  lethal  injections.4  However,  the  individuals  who \nadminister lethal injections must have more adequate and \nappropriate  training  related  to  the  drugs  they  will \nadminister and to the assessment of anesthetic depth than \ncalled  for  under  the  protocols  currently  in  use.  The \npredictable result of the lack of such training will be that \nsome inmates will be inadequately sedated, and will suffer \nhorrible pain during the execution process. \nConclusion \nAs  noted, amici take no  position with respect to the \nquestion whether Petitioner Hill's claim is properly brought \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or in a petition for a writ of habeas \ncorpus.  N or do  amici take  any position  herein on the \nquestions  whether  any  particular  jurisdiction's  lethal \ninjection procedure  is  unreliable,  or inflicts  unnecessary \npain, or whether lethal injection is inhumane and/or viola \ntive of the Eighth Amendment per se.  As the above discus \nsion demonstrates,  however,  the  compounds  used  in the \nIn  fact,  amici  note  that  physicians  are  prohibited  from \n4 \nparticipating  in  legally  authorized  executions,  including  lethal \ninjection.

Amici respectfully suggest that the question \nwhether the particular lethal injection procedure used in \nany jurisdiction causes that risk to  rise to  the level of a \nconstitutional  violation  requires  the  development  of  an \nadequate factual record, and cannot properly be addressed \nwithout a thorough study of the procedure in question. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA PULLIAM  PAUL F.

Mr. Hill  alleged,  in  summary, that  the\nparticular  succession and amountso f three  chemicals used in\nthe  Florida  protocol  \"will  cause  unnecessary pain  in  the\nexecution of...  [his]  sentence  of death.\"  Complaint, ¶18.\nWithout permitting  any factual  development or  examining\nthe merits of the claims, the district  court denied Mr. Hill’s\ncomplaint for  lack  of jurisdiction,  stating  that  it  was the\n\"functional equivalent\" of a successive habeas petition  under\n28 U.S.C. section  2244 and that  Mr. Hill  should have first\nsought permission from the  Eleventh Circuit  to file  such a\npetition.  Hill  v.  Crosby, __ F.  Supp. __.,  2006 WL1 67585\nat *2 (N.D. Fla. Jan. 21, 2006).\nOn January  23,  2006,  Mr. Hill  appealed  the  district\ncourt’s decision to the United States Court of Appealsf or  the\nEleventh Circuit.  The circuit  court  affirmed,  agreeing with\nthe district  court that  Mr. Hill’s  section 1983 action was the\n\"functional  equivalent\"  of a successive habeas petition  and\nholding  that  28 U.S.C.  section  2244 does  not  permit\nchallenges to a lethal  injection  protocol to be brought in a\nsuccessive habeas corpus petition.  Hill  v.  Crosby, __ F.3rd\n__, 2006 WL1 63607 (llth  Cir.  Jan.  24, 2006).\nOn January  25,  2006, this  Court granted  Mr. Hill’s\npetition  for  certiorari.  Hill  v.  Crosby, ~ U.S. __, 126 S.\nCt.  1189 (2006).  The petition  presents  the  following  two\nquestions:\n1.  Whether a complaint  brought  under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 by a death-sentenced state  prisoner,  whos eeks\nto stay his execution in order to pursue a challenge to\nthe chemicals utilized  for carrying out the execution,\nis properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254?\n2. Whether, under this  Court’s decision  in Nelson, a\nchallenge to a particular  protocol the State plans to\n\n4\nuse  during  the  execution  process  constitutes  a\ncognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983?\nSUMMARY OF  ARGUMENT\nMr. Hill’s  case  presents  the  question  of  whether the\nEleventh  Circuit  correctly  dismissed  his  complaint\nchallenging Florida’s  protocol  for  lethal  injection  without\npermitting any factual  development bearing on the merits of\nthe  claim  he pleaded.  Amicus Curiae urges  this  Court,\nparticularly  in  addressing  Question 2 of  the  questions\npresented for  review, to allow Mr. Hill  to develop his claim\nin  a manner that  accommodatest he  need for  discovery  and\nthe makingo f an adequate factual  record in order to support\ninformed Eighth Amendmenatd judication  of a challenge to  a\nparticular lethal injection protocol.\nIn this  regard, the California case of Moralesv .  Hickman,\ncurrently pending in the United States District  Court for  the\nNorthern District  of California,  is  instructive.  There, the\ndistrict  court concludedt hat  it  properly had jurisdiction  to\nreview whether there  was an unconstitutional  likelihood  that\nMr. Morales would experience unnecessary and excruciating\npain  if  executed  under the  California  procedures. 2 The\ndistrict  court further  determined that,  because the State of\nCalifornia solely possessed information critical  to resolving\nMr. Morales’ claim, limited discovery was warranted prior  to\n2 Although there  are some differences  between the  lethal\ninjection  protocols of California and Florida,  both utilize  a\nmechanicaalp paratus (rather than a syringe) to inject three drugs\nto performt he execution.T  he three drugs are sodiumth iopental, a\nsedative; pancuroniumb romide, a neuromusculabr locking agent;\nand potassiumc hloride, whichi s used to induce cardiac arrest.\nThe crux of Mr. Morales’c hallenge to the California procedurei s\nthat  some componento r  the interaction  of componentso f the\nprotocolw  ill result in his not beings ufficiently anesthetizedb y the\nfirst  chemicalw henth e seconda nd third chemicalsa re injected.\n\nsummary adjudication  of  the  matter.  Based  on  the\ninformation discovered, the district  court concludedt hat Mr.\nMorales has  demonstrated \"substantial  questions\"  that  he\nwould suffer  excessive  pain if  executed under the existing\nprocedures.  With the State’s  input  and modification  of its\nexecution protocol, the district  court then fashioned a limited\nremedyt hat,  if  followed, would have permitted Mr. Morales’\nexecution.  The State  ultimately  was unable to implementi ts\nmodified protocol or otherwise minimizet he unconstitutional\nrisk of an excruciating execution.\nAs the  Morales case demonstrates,  challenges  to  lethal\ninjection  protocols  are  extremely complex, fact-intensive\nlitigations  that require adequate factual  developmenbt efore a\nproper determination can be madea s  to whether a particular\nprotocol  passes  constitutional  muster.  Amicus Curiae\ntherefore  urges this  Court to  allow Mr. Hill  to  pursue his\nchallenge to Florida’s lethal  injection  protocol in the lower\nfederal  courts  so  that  he may develop  a proper  record\nregarding  the  specifics  of  the  protocol  comparable to  the\nrecord  that  has  been  developed,  and  will  be  further\ndeveloped, in  Morales. Amicus Curiae suggests  this  course\nbecause the quality  of the record is  of paramounti mportance\nfor informeda djudication of a constitutional question like the\none presented in Hill.  In testing  lethal  injection  procedures\nagainst  the cruel  and unusual punishments guarantee of  the\nEighth  Amendment, the  federal  courts  \"must  review\nindependently both the legal issues and those factual  matters\nwith which they  are  commingled.\" Oyamav .

Hickman provides  a strong  example\nof  why this  Court  should afford  Mr. Hill  the  opportunity  to\ndiscover  and present  evidence  challenging  Florida’s  lethal\ninjection  procedures.  Mr. Morales  has  developed  a  record\nshowing  that  the  use  of  California’s  existing  execution\nprotocol  created  an undue likelihood  that  he would suffer\nintense  pain  if  executed  by lethal  injection.  Mr. Morales’\nargument was twofold:  First,  due to  the  failure  to  properly\nsedate  the  prisoner, 3 there  was a substantial  probability  that\nhe  would  be  conscious  and  experience  excruciating  and\nunnecessary  pain  when  the  remaining  two  drugs  were\nadministered. 4 Second,  there  were  recurrent,  serious\nproblems with the  personnel  and apparatus  used to  administer\nlethal  injections)  Although  there  are  some differences\nbetween California’s  lethal  injection  procedure and Florida’s\nprotocol, 6 both  states  use  the  same three  chemicals  during\nexecutions  and similar  methods of  delivering  the chemicals.\n3 See Part II,  at pages 12-16, infra.\n4 As the Ninth Circuit  noted: \"There is  no dispute that  in the\nabsence of  a properly  administered  anesthetic,  Morales would\nexperience  the  sensation  of  suffocation  as  a result  of  the\npancuronium bromide and excruciating  pain  from the potassium\nchloride  activating  nerve endings in Morales’ veins.\"  Morales v.\nHickman, 2006 WL3 91604 at  *2.\n5 See Parts III  and IV at pages 16-19, infra.\n6 See Sims v. Florida, 754 So.2d 657, 666 n. 17 (Fla.  2000).\n\nOn January 13, 2006, Mr. Morales brought an action  in\nthe district  court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983 seeking\ninjunctive  relief  to  prevent  the  State  of  California  from\nexecuting  him by means of  lethal  injection  pending the\nresolution of his action.  Mr. Moralesa lleged that  the State’s\nadministration  of Procedure No. 770,7 the lethal  injection\nprotocol  of  California’s  Department of  Corrections  and\nRehabilitation,  constituted  cruel  and unusual punishmenti n\nviolation  of the  Eighth and Fourteenth  Amendmentbs ecause\nit  created a substantial  likelihood that he wouldb e conscious\nand in  agonizing  pain  for  the  duration  of  the  execution\nprocess.  Mr. Morales specifically  alleged  that  the  use of\npancuronium bromide and potassium chloride  in  executing\nhim would cause him to  suffer  excruciating  pain because he\nwould not be properly sedated.  Mr. Morales also alleged that\nCalifornia’s  apparatus  for  delivering  the  chemicals  was\nseverely  flawed and created the  danger that  a proper dosage\nof the sedative sodiumt hiopental would not be delivered,s In\naddition,  Mr. Morales alleged  that  San Quentin’s staff  was\nnot  properly  trained  to  insert  intravenous  tubes,  which\nincreases the risk of inadequate delivery of the sedative.\n7 Although the State  has not madec lear  howP  rocedure 770\nwas developed, it  has concededt hat  no medical personnel were\ninvolved in its  developmenat nd that there has been no medical\napprovalo f the procedure.\n8 California’s  Procedure 770 requires  multiple  sets  of\nintravenous tubing and extensions because the chemicals are\nadministeredt o the prisoner froma  separate rooml ocated behind\nthe gurneyo n whicht he prisoner is strapped. It  is estimatedt hat\napproximatelfyif ty feet of intravenoustu bingi s used to deliver the\ntoxic chemicals to the prisoner. These tubes are connectedw  ith\nvarious \"diaphragms\"o r adapters. The risk of the chemicals not\nbeingp roperlyd eliveredt o the prisoner is greatly increasedb y the\nuse of such lengthy amountso f tubing,  because the tubing can\ncrimp, preventing the chemicalsf rom reaching the prisoner, and\nthe multiplec onnectionisn creaset he risk of leakage.\n\n8\nOn the  same date,  Mr. Morales also  filed  a motion for\ndiscovery,  requesting  numerous documents.  The district\ncourt later  granted a portion of his request and provided Mr.\nMorales with the execution logs and handwritten notes of the\nthree  most recent  California  executions, 9 an unredacted\nversion of Procedure 770, and all  existing electrocardiograms\n(\"EKGs\")o f executed prisoners.\nMr. Morales filed  a Motion for  a TemporaryR  estraining\nOrder on January 17, 2006, whicht he district  court construed\nas a motion for  a preliminary injunction.  The district  court\nheld the first  hearing on Mr. Morales’ motion on January 26,\n2006. The main focus of the hearing was to discuss the three\nmost recent  executions,  as  well  as  whether  the  use  of\npancuronium  bromide  was necessary  in  the  execution\nprotocol  given  that  it  would prevent  any observer  from\ndetecting  whether the  prisoner  was properly  sedated.  The\ncourt  ordered additional  briefing  regarding the  three  most\nrecent executions, with a timetable that,  while expeditious,\nwould allow  Mr. Morales’ expert  to  review  the  recently\nobtained execution logs and handwritten notes.\nAt the subsequent hearing,  held on February 9, 2006, the\ndistrict  court noted that there were significant  problemsw  ith\nthe  three  most recent  executions.  It  was specifically\nconcerned that,  in  the  cases  of Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams\nand Clarence  Ray Allen,  the  prisoners  may not  have been\nproperly sedated,l°  The district  court also noted that  their\n9 The three  most recent  executions  that  California  had\nconductedw  ere those of DonaldB  eardslee on January 19, 2005;\nStanley \"Tookie\" Williams on Decembe1r 3, 2005; and Clarence\nRayA  llen on January1 7, 2006.\nl0 The district  court’s findings at this hearing werep remised\nupon the discovery afforded to Mr. Morales, three declarations\nfrom Dr. MarkH  eath, a Professor of Clinical Anesthesiologya t\nColumbiaU  niversity Medical Center,  and numerouse yewitness\naccounts of the previous executions. As described more fully\n\nbreathing  persisted  for  much longer  than  the time the  State’s\nexpert  suggested  would  be  expected. ~ In  addition,  the\ndistrict  court  determined that  the  EKGsp rovided by the State\nand  used  to  monitor  the  prisoners’  breathing  were\nscientifically  invalid  in that  they did not indicate  the rate  of\nbreathing  or  the  time  between breaths.  The district  court\nfound  a third  declaration  provided  by Dr.  Mark Heath,  Mr.\nMorales’s anesthesiology  expert,  particularly  persuasive,  and,\nas  a  result,  requested  additional  supplemental  briefing  to\naddress  the  feasibility  of  proceeding  with  Mr. Morales’\nexecution  either  using  only sodium thiopental  or  utilizing  an\nindependent  means to  ensure  that  he would be unconscious\nbefore  pancuronium  bromide  and  potassium  chloride  were\ninjected/2\nbelow, the recent  executions demonstrate that  the State  continued\nto experience difficulties  administering executions after  the same\ndistrict  court had rejected  a challenge  to lethal  injection  the\nprevious year.  In particular,  the execution logs and handwritten\nnotes  taken by prison  officials  during  the  executions  of  Mr.\nWilliams and Mr. Allen demonstrate a significant  likelihood  that\nboth of these prisoners experienced excruciating pain during their\nexecutions.\n~l  The State’s  expert opined that  a properly sedated prisoner\nreceiving  five  grams of  sodium thiopental  would stop breathing\nwithin one minute.\n12 The State  respondedt o the district  court’s  order by arguing\nthat  it  would be \"feasible\"  to  execute  Mr. Morales by using\nsodiumt hiopental  alone, but that  it  might unnecessarily delay the\nexecution as  it  could take up to  forty-five  minutes to produce\ndeath.  The State  argued that  prior  executions  had taken  11.3\nminutes, on average,  to complete. As to the  second option,  the\nState  responded  that  it  would have the  Warden stand  in  the\nchambert o assess whether the prisoner  was unconscious, rejecting\nthe court’s  suggestion that  persons other than those  employedb y\nthe Departmento f Corrections be present in the chamberw  ith the\nprisoner.\n\n10\nOn February 14, 2006, the district  court  issued an order\naddressing  \"the  narrow question  of  whether the  evidence\nbefore  the  Court  demonstrates  that  Defendants’\nadministration  of  California’s  lethal-injection  protocol\ncreates an unduer isk that Plaintiff  will suffer  excessive pain\nwhen he is  executed.\"  Morales v.  Hickman,  F.  Supp. 2d\n__, 2006 WL3 35427 at  * 6 (N.D. Cal.  Feb. 14, 2006).  The\ncourt  found  that  Mr. Morales  had \"raised  substantial\nquestions in this regard.\" Id.  Specifically, it  noted that\nevidence from Defendants’  own execution  logs  that\nthe  inmates’  breathing  may not  have  ceased  as\nexpected in at  least  six out of thirteen  executions by\nlethal  injection  in  California  raises  at  least  some\ndoubt  as  to  whether  the  protocol  actually  is\nfunctioning as intended, and because of the paralytic\neffect  of  pancuronium bromide,  evidence  that  an\ninmate was conscious at  some point  after  that  drug\nwas injected  would be imperceptible  to anyone other\nthan  a  person  with  training  and experience  in\nanesthesia.\nId.  at *6. The district  court went on to hold that California’s\nProcedure 770 had to  be altered  to  ensure that  Mr. Morales\nwould not  be conscious during  his  execution.  It  gave the\nState  two options:  either  employ two anesthesiologists  to\nmonitor consciousness, or use only the prescribed five  grams\nof sodium thiopental  and eliminate  the other two drugs from\nthe  execution.  The district  court,  however, refused to stay\nMr. Morales’ execution date of February 21, 2006.\nThe  State  chose  the  option  of  having  two\nanesthesiologists  present during the execution.  On February\n16,  2006,  the  district  court  issued  a compliance order\ndetailing  the procedure to be followed, most notably ordering\nthat the anesthesiologists \"take all  medically necessary steps\nto ensure that  [Mr. Morales] is  and remains unconscious.\"\n\n11\nMr. Morales  appealed  to  the  United  States  Court  of\nAppeals for  the Ninth Circuit,  which affirmed the judgment\nbelow.  Morales v.  Hickman,  F.3d  ,2006  WL3 91604\n(9th Cir.  Feb. 19, 2006). The court agreed with the district\ncourt that there were troubling questions raised by the record,\nbut  it  concluded  that  the  lower  court’s  remedy would\nalleviate the risk of unnecessaryp ain.\nAs the  execution  date  approached,  however,  the\nanesthesiologists  retained  by the State learned -  apparently\nbelatedly  -  what they  would be expected to  do during  the\nprocedure,  and they refused to  participate. 13 On the eve of\nthe  execution,  the State  changed course and decided that  it\nwould execute Mr. Morales by the  use of  sodium thiopental\nalone.  The district  court,  at  a heating held on February 21,\n2006, expressed concern and some skepticism  as to  how the\nState  could have misinterpreted  the  court’s  prior  order\nrequiting  the  anesthesiologists  to  both  monitor\nunconsciousness and \"take  all  medically necessary steps\"  to\nensure  that  Mr. Morales would remain unconscious  during\nthe  administration  of all  three  chemicals. As a result,  the\ndistrict  court subsequently entered a very specific  compliance\norder requiring  that  the  personnel administering the  sodium\nthiopental  be licensed  and properly  trained,  and directly\ninject  the  sedative  into  Mr. Morales instead  of  using the\nextended lengths  of tubing called  for  in Procedure 770. The\nState  declined  to  conduct  the  execution  under  these\nconditions, stating that it  did not want to have any individual\npresent  in the  execution chamberd uring the execution.  As a\nresult,  the execution did not take place before the execution\nwarrant expired.  Subsequently, the district  court ordered an\nevidentiary heating to begin on May2 , 2006.\n13 Stacy Finz, BobE  gelko, & KevinF agan, Killer’s  execution\nrescheduled, delay comesb efore doctors walk out,\" new lethal\ninjection  set  for 7:30 p.m.,  S.F.

Execution logs kept by San\nQuentin State  Prison for  prior  executions and obtained by\nMr. Morales, partly  through this  court-ordered  discovery,\nwere particularly  revealing  in demonstrating problems with\nprior executions, and were heavily relied  upon by the district\ncourt.  They provided  a  basis  for  Mr. Morales’  expert\nconsultant, Dr. MarkH  eath, an anesthesiologist  familiar  with\nlethal  injection protocols throughoutt he country, to evaluate\nthe actual operation of the California protocol and advise the\ncourt  about it  in  a series  of four  progressively  informed\ndeclarations.\nConsequently, the  district  court  concluded that,  at  a\nminimums, ix  of California’s  thirteen  executions by lethal\ninjection  had significant  problems related  to  the  risk  of\nimproper anesthesia  administration.  Procedure 770 specifies\nthe  use of  five  grams of sodium thiopental  for  the  stated\npurpose  of  anesthesia.  Both the  State  and Mr. Morales\nagreed that  this  amount of sodium thiopental,  if  properly\nadministered,  would be sufficient  not  only to  render  the\nprisoner  unconscious, but to  stop his breathing  within one\nminute and result  in death  within a few minutes. However,\nthe  record developed to date  shows that  prisoners  executed\nunder the protocol have not reacted to the sodiumt hiopental\nin this expectedf ashion.\nFor  example,  witness  accounts  of  the  execution  of\nStephen WayneA  nderson suggest  that  he was not properly\n\n13\nanesthetized  when he died.  The January 29, 2002 execution\nlog for  Mr. Anderson’s execution,  which the State  recently\nproduced to  Mr. Morales in  discovery,  reveals  that  Mr.\nAnderson continued breathing  until  five  minutes after  the\nthiopental  was administered.  This persistent  respiratory\nactivity  is  not consistent  with the  expected effect  of five\ngramso f thiopental,  whichs hould stop all  visible respiratory\nactivity  within a minute of its  delivery.  In addition,  the\nexecution took over thirty  minutes, and during that  time Mr.\nAnderson’sc hest  and stomach heaved more than thirty  times.\nIrregular  heaving of  the  chest  is  not consistent  with the\ndepression  of the  central  nervous system caused by sodium\npentothal. ~4 Rather, chest  heaving is  indicative  of labored\nrespiratory  activity,  whichi n turn strongly suggests that Mr.\nAnderson was conscious,  and indeed may have been laboring\nagainst the paralyzing effect  of the pancuroniumb romide.\nThe execution  log  of  Manuel Babbit’s  1999 execution\nalso  indicates  that  he was not  fully  sedated  during  the\nprocess.  A minute  after  the  pancuronium  bromide  was\nadministered,  Mr. Babbit had shallow respirations  and brief\nspasms in his  upper abdomen,w  hich is  evidence that  he was\nreacting  to  the  effects  of  the  pancuronium bromide.  In\naddition,  Mr. Babbit’s heart  rate  remained constant until  the\npotassium chloride  was administered;  whereas, if  the  full\ndose of sodiump entothal  had been properly administered and\ndistributed,  Mr. Babbit’s  heart  rate  would have changed\nsignificantly.  His distress  was evident to witnesses of the\nexecution,  one of  whoms tated  that  about  three  or  four\nminutes after  Mr. Babbit closed his eyes and took a couple of\ndeep breaths,  he had a sudden and extreme convulsion which\nlasted  a few seconds.  This witness opined that  Mr. Babbit\nappeareda bout to break all  the restraints  whent his  occurred.\n14 According to Dr. Heath, the typical  reaction  to sodium\npentothal is yawning,d rawingo ne or two deep breaths, or visibly\nexhalings o that the cheeksp uff out.\n\n14\nFurthermore,  a review of  Mr. Babbit’s  execution  log\nshows that  he maintained a steady heart  rate  of  between 95\nand 96 beats per minute a full  seven minutes after  the sodium\nthiopental  was administered.  If  the  full  five-gram dose of\nsodium thiopental  was properly  administered,  there  would\nhave been significant  hemodynamicco nsequences, including\na change of heart rate,  during this  time period. The log also\nindicates  that  Mr. Babbit had spasmodic movementso f  the\nupper chest after  the pancuroniumb romide was administered,\nsimilar  to  what was noted  during  the  Stephen  Anderson\nexecution - again raising  the concern that Mr. Babbit did not\nreceive the full  five grams of sodiumt hiopental and thus was\nconscious  during  the  administration  of  the  pancuronium\nbromide.\nThe execution  logs  of  William Bonin’s 1996 execution\nalso reflect  irregularities  that mayh ave caused him to die in\nexcruciating  pain.  Mr. Bonin was given  a second dose of\npancuroniumb romide for  reasons  that  remain unclear,  even\nthough the initial  dose would paralyze a person for  several\nhours.  The redundant dose raises  questions  about whether\nBonin received  the  initial  doses of  sodium pentothal  and\npancuronium bromide; whether the  injection  team believed\nthat  he was still  conscious; and, more broadly, whether such\nan irregularity  is  indicative  of  the  lack  of  training  or\njudgment of  injection  personnel.  These accounts of  earlier\nCalifornia  executions, according to the Ninth Circuit,  were\n\"extremely troubling,\"  because they indicate  \"that  there  were\nproblemsa ssociated with the administration of the chemicals\nthat  may have resulted  in  the  prisoners  being conscious\nduring portions  of the  executions.\"  Beardslee v.  Woodford,\n395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th  Cir.  2005). \nEvidence developed in the Morales litigation  relating  to\nmore recent  executions  buttresses  this  conclusion.  The\nhandwritten records of Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams’ execution\nsuggest that  the  entire  dose of sodium thiopental  may not\nhave reached Mr. Williams, though none of this  information\n\n15\nwas recorded in his execution log.  The State was not able to\nexplain  why the  execution  log  did  not  contain  the\ninformation  present  in  the  handwritten  notes  which were\ntaken  during  the  execution.  The notes  indicate  that  Mr.\nWilliams did not stop breathing until  12:34 a.m.,  upon the\ninjection  of the potassium chloride,  twelve minutes after  the\nthiopental was injected.  Thus, the thiopental did not have the\neffect  on Mr. Williams’ brain  and respiratory  activity  that\nwould be expected, with a high degree of medical certainty,\nfrom the delivery into the circulatory systemo f the full  five-\ngramd ose of thiopental.\nThe execution log of  Clarence Ray Allen states  that  he\ncontinued breathing for nine minutes after  the delivery of the\nthiopental.  All evidence  demonstrates  that  five  grams of\nthiopental,  if  successfully  delivered  into  the circulatory\nsystem,  would ablate  cerebral  electrical  and respiratory\nactivity.\nThe March 15, 2000 execution  log of Darrell  Keith Rich\nstates  that Mr. Rich’s respirations  ceased at  12:08 a.m., with\nthe administration of the pancuronium,b ut that  Mr. Rich had\n\"chest  movements\"l asting  from 12:09 to 12:10 a.m..  These\nchest  movements, beginning after  Mr. Rich had ostensibly\nstopped breathing (and while he was still  alive,  as shownb y\nhis  heart  rate  of 110 beats  per minute),  and three  minutes\nafter  the  administration  of  the  thiopental,  are  again\ninconsistent  with proper administration  of  the thiopental.\nThe chest  movements are  consistent,  however,  with  an\nattempt to fight  against the accruing paralytic  effect  of the\npancuronium. According to Dr. Heath, if  the  five-gram dose\nof  thiopental  had reached  Mr. Rich and had the  expected\neffect,  he would not  have been able  to  fight  against  the\npancuronium by attempting  to  breathe,  nor  would he even\nhave been aware of  the  effect  of the  pancuronium. Indeed,\nbecause the sodiumt hiopental  dose,  successfully  delivered,\nwould have arrested  all  cerebral  activity,  including  all\nrespiratory  drive,  there  should have been no effort  on Mr.\n\n16\nRich’s part  to  attempt to breathe  during the  onset of  the\npancuronium.\nIII.\nFACTUAL DEVELOPMENT WAS CRITICAL  TO  MR.\nMORALES’  DEMONSTRATION  THAT  PERSONNEL\nAT  SAN QUENTIN ARE NOT PROPERLY TRAINED\nTO  INSERT  INTRAVENOUS LINES.\nThere has also been a demonstrated problem of incorrect\nintravenous placementi n at least  three California executions.\nMost recently,  during  the  execution  of  Stanley  \"Tookie\"\nWilliams, the injection team took twelve minutest o insert  the\nintravenous  lines.  The first  line  was placed quickly  but\nspurted blood, and the staff  struggled for  eleven minutes to\ninsert  the  second line,  having  so much difficulty  that\nWilliams asked whether they were \"doing that  right.\"  Kevin\nFagan,  The  Execution  Of  Stanley  Tookie  Williams\nEyewitness.\"  Prisoner  Did Not Die Meekly, Quietly,  S.F.\nCHRON.,D  ec. 14,  2005,  at  A12. The difficulty  of  the\nchallenge presented to the intravenous team is  evidenced by\nthe  commentth at  \"[b]y  12:10 a.m.,  the  medical tech’s  lips\nwere tight  and white and sweat was pooling on her forehead\nas  she probed Williams’ arm.\" Id.  Moreover, the  execution\nlog of Williams’ execution showst hat  one of the intravenous\nlines failed.\nSimilarly,  the  execution  log  of  Donald Beardslee’s\nexecution  indicates  that  the  second intravenous  line  was\ninserted with \"difficulty,\"  and the time entries indicate that it\ntook twelve  minutes to  insert  the  second line,  which is\nconsistent with encountering problemsi n inserting  the line.\nWhen it  proceeds  smoothly,  placement  of  a  peripheral\nintravenous should, in  Dr. Heath’s experience,  take  on the\norder  of two minutes or  less.  In  the  execution of  William\nBonin, it  took the staff  assigned anywhereb etween eighteen\nand twenty-seven minutes to fashion the  intravenous lines.\n\n17\nThis is  an unusually long period of  time for  an experienced\nand properly trained professional.\nIn  the  execution  of  Stephen Anderson on January  29,\n2002,  one of  the  persons  who attempted  to  secure  an\nintravenous was unable to  do so without causing significant\nbleeding and the need to remove his gloves.  This experience\nindicates  that  the process is  a difficult  one and that  it  is\nnecessary  that  those  doing it  are  properly  trained  and\nexperienced.\nIV.\nFACTUAL  DEVELOPMENT WAS CRITICAL  TO\nMR.  MORALES’  DEMONSTRATION THAT  THE\nEXECUTION  TEAM DEVIATED  FROM\nPROTOCOL BY  ADMINISTERING  MULTIPLE\nDOSES  OF  CHEMICALS AND THAT THESE\nIRREGULARITIES  WERE NOT REPORTED IN\nEXECUTION  RECORDS.\nThe administration  of a second dose of pancuronium( the\nneuromuscularb locking agent),  as indicated  in the log of Mr.\nBonin’s execution  on February 23,  1996, was a source  of\nconcern to the district  court hearing Mr. Morales’ case.  The\ncourt also  was concerned wheni t  learned that  a second dose\nof potassium chloride  (which bumst hrough the veins to  the\nheart,  where it  produces  intense  muscle  cramping  and\neventually  cardiac  arrest),  was administered  to  three\np1r5isoners,  including Clarence Ray Allen.\n15 A declaration providedb y Dr. Jack St. Clair of San Quentin\nState Prison indicates that a secondd ose of potassiumc hloride was\ninjected into Mr. Allen, resulting in a fiat  line and pronouncement\nof  death.  The execution  logs  provided  to  Mr. Morales in\ndiscovery,  however, made no mention of  a second dose of\npotassiumc hloride in Mr. Allen’s case or in any other execution.\n(The district  court noted that executionl ogs had been altered by\nthe State without any indication as to whom  adet he alteration.\nMorales v.  Hickman,_ _ F.  Supp. 2d __, 2006 WL3 35427 at  *5\n\n18\nThesei rregularities  led the district  court to observet hat\nevidence  in  the  present  record  raises  additional\nconcerns as to the manner in which the drugs used in\nthe  lethal-injection  protocol  are administered.  For\nexample, it  is  unclear  why some inmates--including\nClarence  Ray Allen,  who had a  long  history  of\ncoronary artery  disease  and suffered  a heart  attack\nless  than five  months before he was executed,...  --\nhave required  second doses of  potassium chloride  to\nstop promptlyt he beating of their  hearts.\nMorales  v.  Hickman,  F.  Supp.  2d.,  2006WL335427\nat  *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2006).\nCONCLUSION\nThe record developed in the  Morales case was sufficient\nto enable the district  court to  determine that  California’s\nexecution protocol was riddled  with problems that  threatened\nto  produce needless,  agonizing pain unless the protocol  was\nsignificantly  modified.  Mr.  Morales  could  not  have\ndeveloped such a record without court-ordered discovery and\nhearings  through which he was able  to  obtain  and present\nreliable  evidence  about  the  actual  functioning  of  the\nCalifornia  protocol.  That evidence revealed,  amongo ther\nn. 12.)  Immediately following  the  Allen execution,  on January 17,\n2006, Steven  Ornoski,  Acting  Warden of  San Quentin State  Prison,\nstated  that  the  injection  team was forced  to  administer  a second\ndose  of  potassium  chloride  to  Mr. Allen.  Warden Ornoski  also\nrevealed  at  this  time that  the injection  team had used a second dose\nof  potassium  chloride  in  two previous  executions.  See  Kevin\nFagan,  Reporter’s  Eyewitness  Account of  Allen’s  Execution,  S.F.\nCHRON., Jan.  17,  2006,  at  http://  www.sfgate.com/cgi-\nbin/article.cgi?f=c/a/2006/01  /  17/MNG37GOHD715.DTL&hw=fag\nan&sn=003&sc=679.\n\n19\nthings,  a wide chasm between the painless  way in which the\nprotocol  was theoretically  expected  to  operate  and the\ntorturous wayi t  operated in fact.\nThe Eighth  Amendmenti ssues  raised  by Mr. Hill’s\nsection  1983 complaint cannot and should not be addressed\nwithout  an adequate  factual  record.

He has  filed  such a  challenge  in  Virginia  and in  the\ncourse  of  pursuing  his  lawsuit,  he has obtained  substantial\ndiscovery  regarding  Virginia’s  lethal  injection  procedure,\nwhich is  similar  in key respects  to  the  procedure used by all\nother  states  that  employ lethal  injection,  including  Florida.\nThe information  learnedby  Amicus regarding  Virginia  is  not\nreadily  available  to  the  public  and would not  otherwise  be\nknown by  the  Court  without  the  submission  of  an  amicus\nbrief  of  this  kind.  Amicus, therefore,  submits  this  amicus\nbrief  to  inform the  Court about serious  problems with state\nlethal  injection  protocols  and the  need for  Section  1983 to\nenable  death-sentenced  inmates  to  redress  such problems.\nSUMMARYO  F ARGUMENT\nVirginia,  like  other states,  has chosen a lethal  injection\nprocedure  that  raises  grave constitutional  concerns.  Amicus\nhas learned  via  discovery  that  Virginia  entrusts  the  admini-\nstration  of  its  three-drug  chemical  combination  to  prison\nemployees who lack  any training  in  administering  anesthe-\nsia.  The executioners--led  by a  high  school  graduate  with\nno medical  training  whatsoever--have  no idea  how to  de-\ntermine  whether an inmate  has  achieved  a sufficiently  deep\nlevel  of  sedation  that  he is  adequately  shielded  from the\nagonizing  pain  caused  by the  lethal  chemicals.  Even if  the\nexecutioners  had  been taught  how to  monitor  the  level  of\nsedation,  their  training  would be useless  because  they  are\nphysically  separated  from the  inmate by a curtain  during  the\n1 Noc ounself or a party authoredt his brief in wholeo r in part, and\nno persono r entity other than counselt o Amicums adea  monetaryc ontri-\nbution to the preparationo r submissiono f this brief.  Letters fromt he\nparties consentintgo  the filing of this brief are on file witht he Clerk.\n\nentire  procedure.  Andt he  inmate cannot express conscious-\nness or pain because he has been administered,  for  cosmetic\nreasons,  a paralyzing drug that  neither  aids his anesthesia\nnor hastens his death.\nThe state’s  protocol itself  reveals either  a lack of con-\ncern about the infliction  of extreme pain or ignorance of how\neach chemical operates.  For example, if  the  prisoner  re-\nmains alive ten minutes after  the drugs are applied, the pro-\ntocol directs  the executioner to readminister the painful kill-\ning drugs--but not the anesthesia. If  the inmate is still  alive\nafter  ten minutes, however, it  is  probably because the  exe-\ncutioners  failed  to properly administer the  drugs--and that\nthe anesthesia  either  wore off  or  never took hold. Yet Vir-\nginia will not apply additional anesthesia.\nVirginia  adheres  to  its  unsound method of  conducting\nlethal  injection  despite evidence of problemsi n other states\nthat  use similar  methodsa nd despite  the  ready availability\nof alternative  methods. Virginia could readily use different,\nless  painful  drugs,  or  it  could employ personnel  who are\ntrained in ensuring that  the person is  properly anesthetized\nand therefore  does not experience pain.  Without meaningful\nexplanation, the state  rejects  both options.\nAbsent a cause  of  action  under Section  1983, Amicus\nwould not have been able  to  expose the  astonishing  inade-\nquacies  inherent  in  the  design and implementation of  Vir-\nginia’s  protocol.  The state  has fought tenaciously to shield\nits  procedures from public disclosure  and judicial  review.\nOnly Amicus’sl awsuit has forced Virginia to disclose its  pro-\ncedures--over  the  Commonwealth’sv ehement and repeated\nobjections before both the district  judge and the magistrate\njudge.  Even after  disclosing  its  procedures in  discovery,\nVirginia  unsuccessfully  tried  to  prevent  Amicusf rom pre-\nsenting  information  about those procedures to  this  Court.\nThis penchant for  secrecy underscores the need for  courts to\nadjudicate Section 1983 challenges to specific lethal  injection\nprotocols in order to ensure that lethal  injection  is  in fact\ncarried out in a constitutional  manner.\n\n3\nARGUMENT\nI. SECTIO1N9 83 IS A VrrALT OOLT OE  NSURTEH  AT\nINJECTIOISN  CONDUCTINg DA  CONffI’ITt~ONMALA NNER\nAmicush as filed  his suit  to challenge serious yet wholly\navoidable problemsw  ith Virginia’s lethal  injection  protocol.\nHis suit  questions not whether he mayb e executed, nor even\nwhen, but  rather  how. The tight  veil  of  secrecy  in  which\nVirginia  and other  states  cloak their  execution procedures\nprevents  death-sentenced inmates from learning  the  details\nabout how the  state  intends  to kill  them. In  pursuing his\nSection 1983 claim,  Amicush as learned  new and disturbing\nfacts  about Virginia’s  lethal  injection  procedure, which he\ndiscusses in depth below. See infra  pp. 8-15. Amicusa ccord-\ningly believes that Section 1983i s critical  to ensuring that if\nhe is  to  be executed,  his  execution does not unnecessarily\nand unconstitutionally  risk causing him excruciating pain.\nAmicus’s execution  is  unscheduled.  He currently  has\npending two separate habeas petitions:  a petition  on remand\nfrom this  Court for  reconsideration  in  light  of  Banks v.\nDretke, 540 U.S. 668 (2004),2 and an authorized  successive\npetition  raising  a claim of mental retardation  in which the\nF3ourth Circuit  has ordered an evidentiary hearing.\n2 See Walkerv . True, 126 S. Ct. 1028( 2006).\n3 See Walker v. True, 399 F.3d 315 (4th Cir. 2005). Amicusi s  aware\nof pending lawsuits in at least  four other states--Maryland, North Caro-\nlina,  Oklahoma,a nd Texas--that are being pursued while collateral  at-\ntacks remain outstanding.  In Oklahoma,t wo inmates whose federal  ha-\nbeas petitions  are still  pending have filed  § 1983 suits.  See Andersonv .\nJones, No. CIV-05-825-F(W  .D. Okla. July 20, 2005) (§ 1983 suit  filed \ntwo inmates); AIwlerson v.  Mullin, No. 04-6397 (10th Cir.  May3 1, 2005)\n(habeas petition);  Taylor v.  Gibson, No. 6:01-CV-00252-JHP-KE(EW.D  .\nOkla. Nov. 29, 2001) (same). In Maryland,a n inmate is pursuing a § 1983\nclaim while his state  collateral  attack  remains pending. See Evans v.\nSaar, No. l:06-cv-00149-BEL( D. Md.) (§ 1983 suit);  Evans v.  State,  No.\n107, 2006 WL2 69980( Md. Feb. 6, 2006) (state  collateral  attack  remains\npending). The same is  true for inmates in Texas and North Carolina. See\nRaby v. Livi~ujston,  No. H-05-765( S.D. Tex. Nov. 16, 2005) (denying \ntion to dismiss § 1983 claim and discussing procedural posture); Page v.\nBeck, No. 5:04-ct-00004-BO(E  .D.N.C.A  ug. 5, 2004) (same).\n\n4\nIn light  of this  Court’s decision in Nelson v.  Campbell,\n541 U.S. 637 (2004),  and in light  of his concerns about the\ngrave yet  wholly unnecessary risk  of severe pain imposedb y\nVirginia’s  lethal  injection  protocol,  Amicusf iled  a Section\n1983 complaint in the Eastern District  of Virginia on August\n10, 2005. The district  court denied Virginia’s motiont o dis-\nmiss and held  that  Amicus stated  a claim  under  Section\n1983.4 The district  court subsequently denied Virginia’s  mo-\ntion  to exclude from the challenge all  consideration  of  the\nselection,  training and qualifications  of personnel involved in\nadministering lethal  injection)\nFollowing the  denial  of  Virginia’s  motion to  dismiss,\nAmicush as conducted extensive  discovery and has learned a\nconsiderable  amount about the  grave inadequacies  of  Vir-\nginia’s  lethal  injection  process.

These concerns deserve  full  review by federal\ncourts.\n1. Virginia’s Lethal Injection  Protocol Requires\nPrison Employees Without Adequate Training\nto  Administer DangerousD  rugs Via a Danger-\nous Procedure\na. Virginia  has chosen  a three-drug  com-\nbination  that  may inflict  extreme  and\nunnecessary  agony\nVirginia--like  Florida,  and like  every other state  that\nconducts lethal  injection--uses  a three-drug  chemical com-\nbination that  consists  of an anesthetic,  a muscle paralyzer,\nand a painful  drug that  kills  by stopping the heart.  In Vir-\nginia,  the  drugs are  sodium thiopental,  pancuronium bro-\nmide, and potassium chloride,  respectively.\nSodiumt hiopental  is  an ultra-short-acting  anesthetic\nthat is customarily used in surgery to induce anesthesia for  a\nbrief  period of time.  The drug is  packagedi n  powderedf orm\nand must be properly mixed with water in  the right  concen-\ntration  in order to have the intended effect.  If  sodiumt hio-\npental  is  not properly  delivered  into  the  inmate’s blood-\nstream,  then he may never becomea dequately  anesthetized.\nAlternatively, even if  the inmate is initially  anesthetized, his\nanesthesia mayw  ear off  prior  to,  or during, the application\nof the  subsequent drugs--the  last  of which is,  as discussed\nbelow, extraordinarily painful.\nPancuronium  bromide  is  a  neuromuscular  blocking\nagent that  acts  by paralyzing the muscles--yet has no effect\non awareness, cognition,  or sensation.  It  is  used in surgery\nby trained  anesthesiologists  wheni t  is  imperative that  the\npatient  not moved uring the surgery--such  as,  for  example,\nduring delicate  eye surgery,  in which the  slightest  move-\nment could  prove catastrophic.  Whenp ancuronium bromide\nis  injected  in the quantity mandatedb y Virginia’s  protocol,\nan inmate  is  unable  to  make any voluntary  movements--\n\n8\nmuchl ess  talk  or cry out in pain. If  he is  conscious and in\nexcruciating agony, he will have no way of expressing it.  He\nw° ill be trapped in a chemicalt omb.\nPotassium chloride is  an electrolyte  that  whena dminis-\ntered rapidly and in a high dose causes cardiac arrest.  Injec-\ntion  of concentrated potassium activates  sensory nerve fi-\nbers,  causing severe  pain as  the  drug travels  through the\nvenous system. There is  universal  medical agreement that,\nwithout adequate anesthesia,  an injection  of  a potassium\nchloride overdose causes excruciating  pain prior  to causing\nc~a°rdiac arrest.\nb. Virginia’s  choice  of  execution protocol\nand executioners  needlessly  increases\nthe  danger that  the  inmate will  suffer\nunbearable  pain\nIf  an inmate is  properly anesthetized for  the entire  le-\nthal  injection  process,  then--by definitionqhe  will  feel  no\npain,  except for  the trivial  amounto f pain associated with\nthe initial  insertion of the needle. But Virginia, for reasons\nof its  ownc hoosing, has failed  to take steps that  would en-\nsure  that  an inmate  is  properly  anesthetized.  The Com-\nmonwealthe nlists  executioners whol ack training  in assess-\ning anesthesia  and deploys them in a way that  makes it  par-\nticularly  difficult  to ascertain whethera n inmate is  properly\nanesthetized.\nVirginia assigns execution responsibilities  to prison em-\nployees who have other  jobs  and who work on the  execution\ntneam as  a sideline  without receiving  extra  compensation,\n9 See Expert Report of Dr.  Mark J.S.  Heath in Walker v.  Johnson, at\n6 (Jan. 23, 2006).\nio See id.  at  5-6.  Even Virginia’s  only expert  witness  agrees  with\nAmicus on this  point.

NumerouAs spects of  Virginia’s  Lethal Injec-\ntion  Protocol  Raise  Serious  Concerns About\nWhetherV  irginia Is  Taking AdequateS teps To\nEnsure That Inmates Do Not Suffer Excruciat-\ning Pain\nAmicus’sS ection 1983 suit  does not allege that lethal  in-\njection itself  is  unconstitutional, but he does allege that the\nway that  Virginia is  administering lethal  injection  violates\nthe Constitution.  The facts  that  Amicush as learned via dis-\ncovery only confirm his view.\nFirst,  as  discussed above, the use of pancuroniumb ro-\nmide prevents  inmates from expressing  themselves if  they\nare  in fact  in  great  pain because the anesthetic  either  was\nnot properly applied or subsequently wore off.\nSecond, the  anesthetic  is  applied  by persons who lack\nrelevant  training.  Administering anesthesia  is  a difficult\ntask requiring specific  training in assessing a person’s state\nof  consciousness and ability  to  perceive pain.  Yet the per-\nsons involved in administering anesthesia in Virginia execu-\ntions  lack any such training,  muchl ess  adequate training.  In\nparticular,  the  only person who can see the  inmate during\nthe  administration  of  the  drugs--the  team leader--has  no\ntraining  in assessing anesthetic  depth; indeed he has no for-\nmal education beyonda  high school degree.\nThird, even if  the team leader did have training  in anes-\nthesia,  he would be unable to accurately  gauge whether the\ninmate is  sufficiently  anesthetized.  Anesthetic depth is usu-\nally  determined by talking  to a patient  and watching as con-\nsciousness is  lost  and the patient  no longer responds to ver-\n29 Id. at 110-111.\n3o Virginia’s  execution records,  which documentf or each prisoner\nthe time that  each drug was administered (or  readministered),  demon-\nstrate  that additional anesthesia was never applied.\n\n12\nbal  commands, touching,  and the  application  of  what would\notherwise  (if  the  patient  were unanesthetized)  be painful\nstimuli.  These steps  can be performed only if  the  tester  is\nwithin  literal  arm’s reach of  the  patient. 31 Because the  team\nleader  and other  executioners  are  distanced  from the  inmate\nand separated  from him by a  curtain,  they  cannot  conduct\nthe  necessary  tests  to  determine  whether  he  is  properly\nanesthetized.\nFourth,  although  the  Virginia  execution  team is  not\nchecking  to  determine  whether the  inmate  is  properly  anes-\nthetized,  they  appear  to  believe  that  such  checking  is  not\nnecessary  because,  at  least  in  some cases,  they  can hear  the\npatient  snoring.  Yet the  use  of  snoring  as  a  proxy for  an\nadequate  depth  of  anesthesia  is  medically  unacceptable.  A\nperson who is  snoring  is  only lightly  anesthetized  at  best  and\nmay still  be able  to  experience  pain.  Furthermore,  a lightly\nanesthetized  person  can subsequently  wake up after  the  ad-\nministration  of  pancuronium bromide--yet  be unable  to  ex-\npress  himself,  or  move at  all,  due to  the  paralysis  caused by\nt3h2at  drug.\nFifth,  Virginia’s  protocol  provides  that  if  the inmate is\nnot  dead within  ten  minutes  of  the  three  drugs,  then  the\nprison  employees  will  readminister  pancuronium  bromide\nand potassium  chloride--but  that  they  will  not  administer\nany additional  anesthetic. 33 This further  increases  the prob-\nability  that  the  inmate’s  original  dose of  anesthesia,  if  not\n31 See ExpertR  eport of Dr. Stuart M. Lowsoinn  Walkerv . Johnson,\nat 5-6 (Jan.2 3, 2006).\n32 See Expert Report of Dr. MarkJ .S. Heathi n Walkerv .

At no point does the protocol\nallow for the readministrationo f additional anesthetic. NameWd itness1 \nDep.T r. 122-123.\n\n13\nproperly administered,  mayw  ear off  before,  or  during,  the\npainful administration of potassiumc hloride. This is particu-\nlarly  worrisomeb ecause a delay of ten minutes following the\nadministration  of  potassium chloride  would raise  serious\nquestions about whether the executioners had failed  to cor-\nrectly  administer  the drugs--thereby  increasing  the chance\nthat  the  inmate is  not properly anesthetized  and makingt he\nadministration  of an additional  dose of anesthetic  all  the\nmore necessary.34 Indeed, the very fact  that  Virginia’s  pro-\ntocol contemplates the possibility  that  the inmate mays till\nbe alive  ten  minutes after  the  administration  of  potassium\nchloride  indicates  that  Virginia  prison officials  are aware\nthat  the  administered  drugs will  not always reach  the  in-\nmate as expected and yet they are unwilling to take steps to\nensure that  the inmate remains properly anesthetized.\nSixth, despite the clear guidelines of Virginia’s protocol,\nthe  executioners  have repeatedly  deviated  from it.  Rather\nthan waiting ten minutesa fter  the application of the first  set\nof the  three  drugs,  and then applying pancuroniumb romide\nand potassium chloride,  prison  employees on several  occa-\nsions have waited one to three  minutes and then applied only\npotassium chloride.  This inexplicable  deviation  from proto-\ncol raises  questions as to the ability  of Virginia’s execution-\ners to follow the directions they are given, and raises further\nquestions about whether they are  able  to apply the  danger-\nous drugs with which they  are  entrusted  without  exposing\ninmates to excruciating pain.\nSeventh, Virginia’s  protocol  fails  to provide adequate\nguidelines for  the real  possibility  that  the prison employees\nmayb e unable to obtain peripheral  intravenous access,  i.e.,\nvia an arm or a leg,  and thus will  need to inject  chemicals\ninto a central  vein,  usually the femoral vein,  located in the\ngroin. Central veins, in contrast to peripheral veins, are lo-\ncated deep under skin and tissues  and are adjacent to critical\n34 See Expert Report of Dr. Mark J.S.  Heath in Walker v. Johnson,\nat 13 (Jan. 23, 2006).\n\n14\nstructures.  Inserting  a catheter  into  such a vein is  a difficult\nprocedure  that  must be  performed  by  an individual  with\nadequate  proficiency  and training.  Conducting such  a  pro-\ncedure in the  absence of  such training  risks  severe  and pain-\nful  complications,  such as severe blood loss,  collection  of air\nbetween the  lung  and inner  chest  wall  leading  to  death  by\nsuffocation,  perforation  of  the  bladder,  and multiple  other\npainful  complications. 35 Given that  in  2004, Virginia  did  in\nfact  need to resort  to  a central  vein  in  order  to  execute  an\ninmate,36 the lack of discussion  in  Virginia’s  protocol  of how\nto  perform the central  line  creates  unacceptable risks.\nEighth,  Virginia  does  not  keep adequate  records  that\nmight allow prison  officials  to  determine  whether any prob-\nlems exist  with  its  protocol.  Amicus does not  suggest  that\nVirginia  is  especially  deficient  compared to  other  states  in\nthis  regard--he  merely  notes  that  in  states  that  do keep\nsuch records,  such  as  California,  the  records  have revealed\nthe  possible  existence  of  serious  problems.  For example, in\nCalifornia,  logs kept by prison  officials  suggest that  inmates\ncontinue  to  breathe  beyond a point  that  might be expected  if\nthe  sodium thiopental  had been correctly  applied.  See infra\np. 15.\nIn  sum, Virginia  uses  inadequately  trained  prison  em-\nployees  to  administer  a complex and dangerous  procedure.\nTo perform  this  procedure  correctly,  the  prison  employees\nmust,  among other  things,  mix the  anesthetic  solution  to  the\ndesignated  concentration,  check  tubes,  connectors,  and\nvalves  to  ensure  that  the  drugs are not  leaking,  monitor the\ncatheter  to  ensure that  it  is  securely  sited  within  the  vein,\nand adequately  flush  the  intravenous  lines  with saline  solu-\ntion  to  avoid the  chemicals  from mixing,  precipitating,  and\n35 See Expert  Report  of  Dr.  Mark J.S.  Heath in Walker v.  Johnson,\nat 6-7 (Jan. 23, 2006).\n36 Secret Witness 4 Dep. Tr. 69-70.\n\n15\nfailing  to  reach  the  inmate at  the  proper time and in the\np~r7oper dosages.\nFor these  reasons,  a person who is  administering anes-\nthesia  cannot merely take  on faith  that  the  commantdo   de-\nliver  anesthesia has automatically transported  the recipient\ninto a condition whereh e can feel  no pain. This is especially\ntrue  in  situations  where--as here--the  procedure calls  for\nthe administration  of a paralytic  agent such as pancuronium\nbromide. If  the inmate tries  to express that  he is  still  awake\nor in pain after  the administration  of the  pancuroniumb ro-\nmide,i t  will be too late.\nIf  Virginia wishes to use these unnecessarily risky pro-\ncedures, then it  must take steps to ensure that  the inmate is\nfree  from excruciating  pain.  But as discussed  above, Vir-\nginia  does not even bother to  monitor the  anesthetization\nprocess while it  is  taking place to determine whether or not\nany problems are occurring.  Yet data  from other  states  that\nuse  protocols  very similar  to  Virginia  suggest  that--as\nmight be expected  when using  untrained  personnel  to  ad-\nminister  dangerous drugs--problems do indeed occur.\nIn California,  for  instance,  which uses the  same three\ndrugs as  Virginia  and Florida  (and which uses  two-and-a-\nhalf times as mucha nesthetic as Virginia),  a federal district\ncourt  recently  found that  anomalies in past  executions were\nso severe that  it  barred California  from conducting an up-\ncoming execution as scheduled unless it  either  changed its\ndrugs or  employedp ersonnel with adequate training  in anes-\nthesia.  See Morales v.  Hickman, Nos. C 06-219 JF & C 06-\n926 JF RS, 2006 WL3 35427, at  *5-8 (N.D.  Cal.  Feb.  14,\n2006).  In  particular,  the  court  cited  evidence  from the\nstate’s  execution logs that  indicated  that breathing did not\nstop as  expected within one minute of administration  of so-\ndium thiopental,  but rather  lasted  muchl onger.  See id.  at\n*5-6;  Brief  of  AmicusC  uriae  Habeas Corpus Resource Cen-\n37 See Expert Report of Dr. Mark J.S.  Heath in Walker v. Johnson,\nat 8-10( Jan. 23, 2006).\n\n16\nter  12-16.  Other  states  that  use  the  same three-drug  combi-\nnation  have  experienced  significant  problems--including\nleaking  intravenous  lines,  solidifying  chemicals  that  stop\nflowing,  catheters  inserted  so  that  the  needle  points  in  the\nwrong direction,  difficulties  locating  veins,  and  injections\nthat  cause  veins  to  collapse. 38  These  problems  suggest\nstrongly  that  the  untrained  personnel  who perform  lethal\ninjection  are  not  capable  of  doing  so  in  a  way that  assures\nthat  an  inmate  is  properly  anesthetized.\nB.

HILL, PETITIONER\nv.\nJAMES R. MCDONOUGH, INTERIM SECRETARY,\nFLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.\n(CAPITAL CASE)\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nThis case concerns the manner by which a prisoner sen-\ntenced to death may challenge the method to be used in carry-\ning out his execution.  Federal law authorizes capital punish-\nment for a variety of criminal offenses, and provides that fed-\neral death sentences shall be “implement[ed]  *  *  *  in the\nmanner prescribed by the law of the State in which the sen-\ntence is imposed,” or, if the sentencing State does not autho-\nrize capital punishment, in the manner prescribed by a State\ndesignated by the sentencing court.  18 U.S.C. 3596(a).  Le-\nthal injection has been adopted as the sole or primary method\nof execution in 37 of the 38 States that currently authorize\n(1)\n\n2\ncapital punishment.  See Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d\n1064, 1072 & n.8 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1096 (2005).\nThe Court’s decision in this case will likely resolve the\nclosely related question whether a federal prisoner sentenced\nto death must bring a method-of-execution claim in a motion\nto vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C.\n2255 (the analogue to a petition for habeas corpus by a state\nprisoner under 28 U.S.C. 2254).  Several federal prisoners\nwho have been sentenced to death by lethal injection are cur-\nrently pursuing  a method-of-execution claim in an action\nagainst federal prison officials for injunctive and declaratory\nrelief.  See Roane v. Gonzales, Civ. No. 05-2337 (D.D.C.).  As\na result of the Court’s grant of certiorari in this case, their\nexecutions have been stayed.  In addition, to the extent that\nstate prisoners bring claims seeking to invalidate the method\nof execution used in a particular State without identifying a\npermissible alternative, the federal government has an inter-\nest in the ultimate resolution of those claims, insofar as it may\ndelay or effectively block federal executions to be imple-\nmented  in  accordance  with  that  State’s  procedure.    The\nUnited States therefore has a substantial interest in this case.\nSTATEMENT\n1. On October 19, 1982, petitioner and an accomplice,\nCliff Jackson, stole a car and pistol in Mobile, Alabama, and\ndrove to Pensacola, Florida, where they robbed a savings and\nloan at gunpoint.  Officers arrived at the scene while the rob-\nbery  was  still  in  progress.    Petitioner  fled  the  building\nthrough a back door; Jackson fled through the front and was\napprehended.  While two of the officers were handcuffing\nJackson, petitioner snuck up behind the officers and shot\nthem in cold blood, killing one and wounding the other.  Hill\nv. State, 477 So. 2d 553, 554 (Fla. 1985).\n\n3\n2. In 1983, petitioner was convicted in Florida state court\nof first-degree murder and various other offenses, and sen-\ntenced  to  death.    At  the  time  petitioner  was  sentenced,\nFlorida law provided that electrocution was the method of\nexecution.  See Fla. Stat. Ann. § 922.105 (West 1999).  On di-\nrect appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner’s\nconvictions, but reversed his sentence on the ground that the\ntrial court had erred during the jury-selection process.  Hill\nv. State, 477 So. 2d 553 (1985).  On remand, petitioner was\nagain sentenced to death.  The Florida Supreme Court af-\nfirmed petitioner’s sentence, Hill v. State, 515 So. 2d 176\n(1987), and this Court denied review, 485 U.S. 993 (1988).\nPetitioner then filed both a motion for post-conviction\nrelief in state court and a petition for habeas corpus, pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. 2254, in federal court.  The trial court denied peti-\ntioner’s motion for post-conviction relief, and the Florida Su-\npreme Court affirmed.  Hill v. Dugger, 556 So. 2d 1385 (1990).\nThe federal district court partially granted petitioner’s habeas\npetition on the ground that the state courts had failed to con-\nduct a proper harmless-error inquiry after one of the submit-\nted aggravating factors had been invalidated.  The Florida\nSupreme Court subsequently reopened petitioner’s appeal\nand held that any error was harmless.  Hill v. State, 643 So.\n2d 1071 (1994).  This Court denied review.  516 U.S. 872\n(1995).  Petitioner then filed an amended habeas petition,\nwhich the district court denied.  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, Hill v. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999), and this\nCourt again denied review, 528 U.S. 1087 (2000).\nIn 2000, the state legislature changed the presumptive\nmethod of execution in Florida from electrocution to lethal\ninjection.  See Fla. Stat. Ann. § 922.105(1) (West 2005) (pro-\nviding that “a death sentence shall be executed by lethal in-\njection, unless the person sentenced to death affirmatively\nelects to be executed by electrocution” within a specified pe-\n\n4\nriod).  Petitioner did not elect to be executed by electrocution.\nIn 2003, petitioner filed a second motion for post-conviction\nrelief in state court, in which he did not challenge the consti-\ntutionality of Florida’s new method of execution.  The trial\ncourt denied the motion, and the Florida Supreme Court af-\nfirmed, Hill v. State, 904 So. 2d 430 (2005) (Table).\n3. On November 29, 2005, the Governor of Florida signed\na death warrant, and petitioner’s execution was scheduled for\nJanuary 24, 2006.  On December 15, 2005, petitioner filed a\nthird motion for post-conviction relief in state court, contend-\ning for the first time, inter alia, that execution by lethal injec-\ntion, as administered by the State of Florida, constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  The\ntrial court denied the motion on grounds of procedural de-\nfault.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Hill v. State, No.\n06-2, 2006 WL 91302 (Jan. 17, 2006).  The Florida Supreme\nCourt noted that it had rejected a similar claim in Sims v.\nState, 754 So. 2d 657, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1183 (2000), and\nit rejected petitioner’s argument that he was entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing based on an article recently published in\na British medical journal, The Lancet, on the ground that the\narticle “is inconclusive” and “does not sufficiently call into\nquestion our holding in Sims.”  Hill, 2006 WL 91302, at *2.1\nThis Court denied review.  126 S. Ct. 1441 (2006).\n4. On January 20, 2006, four days before his execution\ndate, petitioner filed an action in federal district court against\nvarious state officials pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983.  J.A. 16-23.\nIn his complaint, petitioner again contended that execution by\nlethal injection, as administered by the State of Florida, con-\n1 To the extent that the Florida Supreme Court rejected petitioner’s claim\non the merits, rather than on the ground that it was procedurally defaulted, the\nFlorida Supreme Court’s decision could have preclusive effect in any subse-\nquent action under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  See Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist., 465\nU.S. 75, 80-85 (1984); Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 96-105 (1980).\n\n5\nstitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  J.A. 21.  Specifically,\npetitioner contended that Florida’s use of a succession of\nthree chemicals—sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide,\nand potassium chloride—“creat[ed] a foreseeable risk of the\ngratuitous and unnecessary infliction of pain on a person be-\ning executed.”  J.A. 18.2  Again citing the Lancet article, peti-\ntioner alleged that, in a number of executions using the same\nsequence of chemicals, prisoners received an insufficient dose\nof sodium pentothal and thus suffered pain from the subse-\nquent chemicals.  J.A. 20.  Petitioner sought a preliminary\ninjunction to allow consideration of his claim, and a perma-\nnent injunction “barring defendants from executing [him] in\nthe manner they currently intend.”  J.A. 22.\n5. On January 21, 2006, the district court dismissed peti-\ntioner’s complaint.  J.A. 11-15.  The court reasoned that peti-\ntioner’s Section 1983 action was “the functional equivalent of\na successive habeas corpus petition,” and petitioner thus could\nnot proceed without first obtaining leave to file from the court\nof appeals under 28 U.S.C. 2244.  J.A. 12.  The court rejected\npetitioner’s contention that the Lancet article constituted\n“newly discovered evidence” on the ground that, “[w]hile the\nLancet article may be new,  *  *  *  the factual basis of [peti-\ntioner’s] claim has certainly been raised and disposed of in\nnumerous cases, both in Florida and in other states.”  J.A. 14-\n15.  The court thus determined that “[petitioner] has made no\nshowing that he could not have discovered these underlying\npredicates through the exercise of due diligence.”  J.A. 14.\n6. On January 24, 2006, the court of appeals affirmed.\nJ.A. 9-10.  The court reasoned that “[i]t is clear to us that the\ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction to consider [petitioner’s]\n2 Lethal injection by means of a succession of three chemicals—sodium\npentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride—is the predominant\nmethod of execution in the United States today and is used by at least 27\nStates.  See Beardslee, 395 F.3d at 1072.\n\n6\nclaim because it is the functional equivalent of a successive\nhabeas petition and he failed to obtain leave of this court to\nfile it.”  J.A. 10.  The court added that any application for\nleave to file a second or successive habeas petition would be\ndenied in any event, on the ground that it would not meet the\nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(2).  J.A. 10.3\n7. Later that day, Justice Kennedy granted a temporary\nstay.  The Court granted certiorari on the following day and\nentered a stay pending decision on the merits.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nA. Petitioner’s challenge to execution by lethal injection,\nas administered by the State of Florida, is cognizable only in\na petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2254, and not in\nan action under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  This Court has repeatedly\naffirmed the principle that certain types of claims by prison-\ners fall within the exclusive scope of the habeas statute.  Spe-\ncifically, this Court has distinguished between challenges to\nthe conditions of a prisoner’s confinement, which can proceed\nin an action under Section 1983, and challenges to the fact of\na prisoner’s confinement or duration of his sentence, which\ncan proceed only in a habeas petition.  Where a prisoner chal-\nlenges a particular method of execution but identifies an alter-\nnative, permissible method of execution, that claim is akin to\na conditions-of-confinement claim, and therefore is cognizable\nin a Section 1983 action.  But where a prisoner contends that\nexecution  per  se  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual  punish-\nment—i.e., that the particular method of execution being con-\ntemplated by the State and any other method of execution\nwould be unconstitutional—that claim amounts to a challenge\nto the prisoner’s sentence because it effectively seeks a reduc-\n3 Petitioner also filed an application for leave to file a second or successive\nhabeas petition, in which he raised other claims.  The court of appeals denied\nthat application in a separate order.  437 F.3d 1080 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n7\ntion in the sentence from death to life imprisonment, and\ntherefore is cognizable only in a habeas petition.\nThe claim at issue in this case more closely resembles the\nlatter type of claim, and therefore is cognizable only in ha-\nbeas.  Petitioner has challenged the method of execution used\nby Florida to deliver lethal injection, but has pointedly de-\nclined to identify any permissible alternative method.  Where\na prisoner challenges his method of execution but fails to\nidentify any permissible alternative, it is reasonable to con-\nstrue that claim as a challenge to his execution per se.  More-\nover, such a claim (if successful) is likely to delay, and poten-\ntially delay substantially, the prisoner’s execution.  If such a\nclaim could proceed in a Section 1983 action, then prisoners\ncould use Section 1983 as a means to delay executions simply\nby waiting until the eve of execution to file suit, as petitioner\ndid here.  Moreover, if such claims were cognizable under\nSection 1983, a prisoner could circumvent any restrictions on\nhis ability to contend in a habeas petition that execution per\nse constitutes cruel and unusual punishment through the sim-\nple expedient of challenging particular methods of execution\nseriatim.  The better view, therefore, is that petitioner’s\nclaim—which seeks relief different only in degree from an\noutright injunction against his execution—is cognizable only\nin a petition for habeas corpus.\nB. If petitioner can pursue his claim only in a habeas peti-\ntion, his action is plainly barred as both successive and un-\ntimely.    Petitioner’s  contention  that  his  action  should  be\ntreated as a “first” habeas petition, rather than a “second or\nsuccessive” one, is not fairly included in the questions pre-\nsented and was not passed on below, and therefore is not\nproperly before this Court.  In any event, it lacks merit.  If\npetitioner’s Section 1983 action were treated as a habeas peti-\ntion, it would unambiguously be barred as a second or succes-\nsive habeas petition that does not come within the stringent\n\n8\nstatutory exceptions for such petitions established by the\nAntiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996\n(AEDPA).  Moreover, even if petitioner’s claim were not\nbarred outright as a second or successive habeas petition, it\nwould be out of time in any event.  AEDPA establishes a one-\nyear statute of limitations for habeas claims.  Petitioner did\nnot file this action until more than six years after Florida\nadopted lethal injection as its preferred method of execution.\nC. Even if prisoners could pursue method-of-execution\nclaims in Section 1983 actions, petitioner’s action is improper.\nThis Court has made clear that, in considering whether a pris-\noner is entitled to injunctive relief in a Section 1983 action, a\ncourt can consider whether the prisoner has engaged in ma-\nnipulation or undue delay.  Such factors would point to deny-\ning relief here, where petitioner waited until just days before\nhis scheduled execution before filing this Section 1983 action.\nMoreover, petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative rem-\nedies before doing so, which provides an independent basis for\nsustaining the lower courts’ dismissal of this action.  Where a\nprisoner challenges the method of execution, it is particularly\nimportant that the State be provided an opportunity to ad-\ndress that claim, and to consider potential alternatives, before\nan action may be brought in federal court.\nIndeed, the litigation incentives surrounding last-minute\ncapital filings led Congress to enact a variety of carefully fo-\ncused requirements for the filing of habeas petitions in that\nsetting.  As the challenge here amounts to an effort to fore-\nstall the sentence, it should be construed as a habeas petition.\nBut even if this Court construes it to be a valid Section 1983\naction, the Court should look to Congress’s treatment of ha-\nbeas petitions and import analogous limitations on last-minute\nfilings, like this one, raising claims that could have been filed\nearlier.  Likewise, this Court should vigorously enforce the\nlimits imposed on civil-rights actions under the PLRA.\n\n9\nARGUMENT\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY HELD THAT PETI-\nTIONER’S  ELEVENTH-HOUR  CHALLENGE  TO  THE\nMETHOD OF HIS EXECUTION WAS FORECLOSED\nPetitioner contends that execution by lethal injection, as\nadministered by the State of Florida, constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment.  That claim, like a more categorical claim\nthat execution per se constitutes cruel and unusual punish-\nment, is cognizable only in a petition for habeas corpus under\n28 U.S.C. 2254, and not in an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983.\nRegardless of how petitioner’s claim is characterized, more-\nover, it is clear that this last-ditch action cannot proceed.  The\ncourt of appeals’ decision should therefore be affirmed.\nA. Petitioner’s Claim Must Be Brought In A Petition For\nHabeas Corpus\nPetitioner contends (Br. 17-29) that his method-of-execu-\ntion claim was cognizable in an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983.\nThat contention lacks merit.\n1. “Federal law opens two main avenues to relief on com-\nplaints related to imprisonment:  a petition for habeas corpus,\n28 U.S.C. § 2254, and a complaint under  *  *  *  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983.”  Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004) (per\ncuriam).  Although Section 1983 by its terms provides a broad\nremedy for the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or im-\nmunities secured by the Constitution and laws,” this Court\nhas held that certain types of claims are cognizable only under\nthe habeas statute.  Specifically, “[c]hallenges to the validity\nof any confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are\nthe province of habeas corpus.”  Id. at 750. \nIn Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973), three state\nprisoners brought an action for injunctive relief under Section\n1983,  seeking  restoration  of  good-time  credits  that  they\n\n10\nclaimed had been unconstitutionally revoked.  The Court held\nthat the prisoners could proceed with their claims only in a\npetition for habeas corpus, not in a Section 1983 action.  Id. at\n500.  The Court reasoned that the habeas statute was “explic-\nitly and historically designed to provide the means for a state\nprisoner to attack the validity of his confinement” and that,\nwhere a prisoner’s claim “goes directly to the constitutionality\nof his physical confinement itself and seeks either immediate\nrelease from that confinement or the shortening of its dura-\ntion,” “[s]uch a challenge is just as close to the core of habeas\ncorpus as an attack on the prisoner’s conviction.”  Id. at 489.\nBy contrast, this Court has “repeatedly permitted prison-\ners to bring § 1983 actions challenging the conditions of their\nconfinement.”  Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 84 (2005)\n(emphasis added); see, e.g., Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S.\n249, 251 (1971) (per curiam) (conditions in maximum security);\nCooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 546 (1964) (per curiam) (access\nto religious publications).  Such a claim falls outside “the\nheart of habeas corpus” because it does not “challeng[e] the\nfact or duration of [a prisoner’s] physical confinement itself,”\nnor does it “seek[] immediate release or a speedier release\nfrom that confinement.”  Preiser, 411 U.S. at 498.\nIn addition, this Court has recognized that a prisoner’s\nclaim may be cognizable in a Section 1983 action if it seeks\n“relief unavailable in habeas, notably damages,” except where\nit “impl[ies] the invalidity either of an underlying conviction\nor of a particular ground for denying release short of serving\nthe maximum term of confinement.”  Muhammad, 540 U.S. at\n751.  With respect to such “hybrid” claims (id. at 750), the\nCourt has held that a prisoner must first challenge his convic-\ntion or sentence by other means, such as a petition for habeas\ncorpus.  See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994).  The\nexception for so-called “hybrid” actions, however, is a narrow\none.  “[W]hen a state prisoner seeks damages in a § 1983 suit,\n\n11\nthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor\nof the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his\nconviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dis-\nmissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the convic-\ntion or sentence has already been invalidated.”  Heck, 512\nU.S. at 487 (emphasis added).  The Court has reasoned that a\nbroader exception would “cut off potentially valid damages\nactions” that “could otherwise have gone forward had the\nplaintiff not been convicted.”  Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S.\n637, 647 (2004).  Although these cases typically involve claims\nfor damages, see id. at 646 (characterizing exception as appli-\ncable to “civil rights damages actions”), this Court has indi-\ncated that the same rule would apply where a prisoner seeks\ndeclaratory relief as an adjunct to his claim for damages, see\nEdwards  v.  Balisok,  520  U.S.  641,  648  (1997);  Wolff  v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 554-555 (1974); prospective injunc-\ntive relief, see Edwards, 520 U.S. at 648; Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n555; or injunctive relief that differs in kind from an injunction\nordering the prisoner’s release or shortening his confinement,\nsee Wilkinson, 544 U.S. at 82.\n2. In Nelson v. Campbell, supra, this Court considered\nhow to categorize a claim seeking injunctive relief enjoining\nAlabama’s use of a so-called “cut-down” procedure in connec-\ntion with an execution by lethal injection.  Because the pris-\noner’s veins had been severely compromised by years of drug\nabuse, the State informed the prisoner shortly before his exe-\ncution that it would make an incision in his arm or leg in order\nto gain venous access.  541 U.S. at 640-642.  The prisoner\nbrought a Section 1983 action, alleging that the use of the cut-\ndown procedure constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe Court held that the prisoner could pursue his claim in\na Section 1983 action.  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644-647.  In so\nholding, the Court emphasized two essential features of the\nprisoner’s claim.  First, the Court noted that the State had\n\n12\nconceded that a prisoner who had not been sentenced to death\ncould bring a similar claim if the State had sought to use the\ncut-down procedure to gain venous access for purposes of\nproviding medical treatment—and that such a claim would be\nanalogous to a conventional conditions-of-confinement claim\nand therefore cognizable in a Section 1983 action.  See id. at\n644.  The Court concluded that there was “no reason on the\nface of the complaint to treat [the instant prisoner’s] claim\ndifferently solely because he has been condemned to die.”  Id.\nat 645.  For that reason, the Court explained that it was un-\nnecessary  to  resolve  the  question  of  how  to  categorize\nmethod-of-execution claims generally.  See id. at 644.\nSecond, the Court observed that the prisoner “ha[d] al-\nleged alternatives that, if they had been used, would have\nallowed the State to proceed with the execution as scheduled”:\nspecifically, that the State could instead have gained venous\naccess by means of a percutaneous central line.  Nelson, 541\nU.S. at 646.  The Court accordingly concluded that “the grava-\nmen of [the prisoner’s] entire claim is that the use of the cut-\ndown would be gratuitous.”  Id. at 645.  The Court suggested\nthat the outcome might be different “[i]f as a legal matter the\ncut-down were a statutorily mandated part of the lethal injec-\ntion protocol, or if as a factual matter [the prisoner] were\nunable or unwilling to concede acceptable alternatives for\ngaining venous access.”  Ibid.\n3. a. The foregoing decisions—and, in particular, this\nCourt’s decision in Nelson—provide the appropriate frame-\nwork for categorizing method-of-execution claims.\nOn the one hand, where a prisoner challenges a particular\nmethod of execution but identifies an alternative, authorized\nmethod of execution, that claim closely resembles the claim at\nissue in Nelson, and therefore could be brought in a Section\n1983 action.  Although such a claim by definition could be\nbrought only in connection with an impending execution, that\n\n13\nclaim necessarily does not “call into question the ‘fact’ or ‘valid-\nity’ of the sentence itself,” because it is clear that, “by simply\naltering its method of execution, the State can go forward\nwith the sentence.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644.  Such a claim is\n“properly viewed as [a] challenge[] to the conditions of a con-\ndemned  inmate’s  death  sentence,”  ibid.,  and,  like  a\nconditions-of-confinement claim brought by any other pris-\noner, is cognizable in a Section 1983 action.4\nOn the other hand, where a prisoner contends that execu-\ntion per se constitutes cruel and unusual punishment—i.e.,\nthat the particular method of execution being contemplated\nby the State and any other method of execution would be\nunconstitutional—that claim can only be brought in a habeas\npetition.  Such a claim would be tantamount to a challenge to\nthe prisoner’s death sentence itself, because “imposition of\nthe death penalty presupposes a means of carrying it out.”\nNelson, 541 U.S. at 644.  Although this Court has never ex-\nplicitly addressed the issue, lower courts have held that chal-\nlenges to a prisoner’s death sentence, like challenges to the\nduration of a non-death sentence, are cognizable only in ha-\nbeas.  See, e.g., Gilreath v. State Bd. of Pardons & Paroles,\n273 F.3d 932, 933 (11th Cir. 2001); Moody v. Rodriguez, 164\nF.3d 893, 893-894 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam); Buchanan v.\nGilmore, 139 F.3d 982, 983-984 (4th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).\n4 In Nelson, this Court suggested that the analysis might be different where\na prisoner was challenging the State’s method of execution as established by\nstatute—for example, if petitioner was here challenging the constitutionality\nof execution by lethal injection simpliciter, rather than execution by lethal\ninjection as administered by the State of Florida.  541 U.S. at 644.  The Court\nreasoned that, where “[a] finding of unconstitutionality would require statutory\namendment or variance,” such a result would “impos[e] significant costs on the\nState and the administration of its penal system.”  Ibid.  The same result would\nfollow from a challenge to the lone authorized method of execution, even if it\npointed to a specific unauthorized alternative.  Here, the statute at issue does\nnot specify the precise means by which a lethal injection will be administered.\n\n14\nb. The claim at issue in this case more closely resembles\nthe latter type of claim, and therefore can be brought only in\na habeas petition.  Although petitioner in his complaint sought\nto enjoin respondents only from “executing [him] in the man-\nner they currently intend,” J.A. 22, petitioner nowhere specif-\nically identified an alternative method by which he could per-\nmissibly be executed.5  Nor has petitioner done so before this\nCourt, instead stating only (with consistent ambiguity) that he\n“could still be executed by a different procedure, including a\ndifferent means of lethal injection chosen by the [State].”\nPet. Br. 21; see id. at 12 (suggesting that “[petitioner] could\nbe executed by a different means of lethal injection chosen by\nthe [State]”); id. at 17 (stating that “[petitioner] concedes that\nother methods of lethal injection the [State] could choose to\nuse would be constitutional”); id. at 22 (contending that “the\n[State] could readily adopt any one of a number of different\napproaches to lethal injection that would end [petitioner’s] life\nwithout a foreseeable likelihood of excruciating pain”).  Ex-\ncept in the abstract, therefore, petitioner remains “unable or\n5 In his complaint, petitioner alleged that, in a number of executions in\nvarious States using the same sequence of chemicals that Florida uses,\nprisoners received an insufficient dose of sodium pentothal, with the result that\nthey were not properly sedated and thus suffered pain from the administration\nof the subsequent chemicals.  J.A. 20.  Petitioner’s complaint therefore might\nbe read to imply that, if the dose of sodium pentothal used by Florida were to\nbe increased, his execution could constitutionally proceed.  Petitioner, however,\nhas pointedly stopped short of explicitly embracing that alternative method (or\nsaying by how much, in his view, the dosage of sodium pentothal should be\nincreased), and he still does not embrace it before this Court—even though he\ncites a decision from another court that effectively adopted it (together with\nother modifications).  See Pet. Br. 22 (citing Morales v. Hickman, No. 06-219,\n2006 WL 335427, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006)).  As discussed in the text above, specifica-\ntion of a lawful alternative means of executing the death sentence not only\nmakes the claim cognizable under Section 1983, but also prevents manipulation\nof the judicial process.\n\n15\nunwilling to concede acceptable alternatives” that “would\nhave allowed the State to proceed with the execution as sched-\nuled.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 645, 646.  Indeed, the statements\nmade in petitioner’s brief about other methods of execution\nare sufficiently vague that petitioner presumably could at-\ntempt to challenge the validity of any alternative method of\nexecution that the State subsequently adopted.\nWhere a prisoner challenges his method of execution but\nfails to identify a permissible alternative, a finding of uncon-\nstitutionality will “impos[e] significant costs on the State and\nthe administration of its penal system.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at\n644.  At a minimum, the State will be required to devise an\nalternative method of execution, which will then potentially be\nsubject to further challenge.  See In re Sapp, 118 F.3d 460,\n463 (6th Cir.) (noting that a method-of-execution claim that\ndoes not identify a permissible alternative “is not equivalent\nto a simple ‘conditions of confinement’ action, such as a claim\nthat a prisoner’s cell is too cold, though the prisoner doesn’t\nobject to being imprisoned in a warmer cell”), cert. denied,\n521 U.S. 1130 (1997).  While it is possible that the State will\neventually be able to carry out the prisoner’s death sentence,\nthis Court has repeatedly recognized that “a State retains a\nsignificant interest in meting out a sentence of death in a\ntimely fashion.”  Ibid.; see Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S.\n538, 556 (1998) (noting that a State has a “powerful and legiti-\nmate interest” in carrying out an execution once first federal\nhabeas proceedings have been completed) (citation omitted).\nAlthough a State’s ability to carry out an execution may be\ntemporarily delayed even where a prisoner identifies a suit-\nable alternative method of execution (while the prisoner’s\nclaim is adjudicated and any alternative method is imple-\nmented), it is far more likely to be delayed, and delayed sub-\nstantially, where there is no guarantee that the State will be\nable to execute the prisoner even after an alternative method\n\n16\nhas been devised.  Requiring the prisoner to identify a spe-\ncific alternative also allows the State and the reviewing court\nto assess the legality and validity of that alternative.  When\nthe alternative is unlawful or impractical, the challenge will\nproduce precisely the kind of costs identified in Nelson.\nIndeed, if a prisoner were able to bring a challenge to a\nparticular method of execution in a Section 1983 action with-\nout identifying a permissible alternative, a prisoner could\n“seek[] sub silentio to preclude imposition of the death pen-\nalty” (Pet. Br. 22) simply by challenging individual methods\nof execution seriatim.  A prisoner who wished to argue that\nexecution per se constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\ncould circumvent any restrictions on his ability to bring that\nclaim in a habeas petition through the “simple expedient of\nputting a different label on [his] pleadings” (Preiser, 411 U.S.\nat 490):  namely, by presenting his claim in a Section 1983\naction as a narrower challenge to the particular method of\nexecution being used by the State, with the knowledge that he\ncould subsequently challenge any other method adopted by\nthe State if his initial claim were successful.  As previously\ndiscussed, the complaint in this case appears to be artfully\ndrafted to leave open the option of pursuing that strategy.  A\nrule that prisoners could pursue method-of-execution claims\nlike petitioner’s in Section 1983 actions would thus effectively\npermit claims challenging the constitutionality of capital pun-\nishment per se in Section 1983 actions as well.6\n4. Relying on the test employed by this Court to catego-\nrize so-called “hybrid” cases—i.e., cases in which the prisoner\nseeks “relief unavailable in habeas,” Muhammad, 540 U.S. at\n6 Although petitioner abstractly contends (Br. 22) that “[h]is is not a\nchallenge objecting merely to the pain inherent in death,” he does not disavow\nany intention to challenge any alternative method of execution adopted by\nFlorida.  That is unsurprising, given that petitioner fails to identify any\nalternative method of execution that he believes would be permissible.\n\n17\n751—petitioner contends (Br. 20) that his claim should be\ncognizable in a Section 1983 action because the claim would\n“not necessarily imply the invalidity of [his] conviction or the\nState’s ability ultimately to carry out the death sentence.”\nThat contention is unsound for two principal reasons.\na. First, this case is not properly classified as a “hybrid”\ncase at all.  Petitioner does not seek damages, and the relief\nthat he does seek—a permanent injunction “barring defen-\ndants from executing [him] in the manner they currently in-\ntend,” J.A. 22—differs only in degree, not in kind, from the\nrelief usually awarded by habeas courts (an order directing a\nprisoner’s immediate release from custody or invalidating or\nmodifying a prisoner’s sentence).  Cf. 28 U.S.C. 2243 (provid-\ning that a court considering a habeas petition may “dispose of\nthe  matter  as  law  and  justice  require”);  see  generally\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. at 85-86 (Scalia, J., concurring) (discuss-\ning forms of relief authorized by habeas statute).  This case is\ntherefore distinguishable in a critical respect from Wilkinson,\nin which the prisoners sought injunctions that would at most\nentitle  them  to  a  new  hearing  (or  further  administrative\nreview)—not injunctions that would directly (or indirectly)\noperate on their convictions or sentences.  See id. at 81, 82.\nPetitioner contends (Br. 17, 19) that, in Nelson, this Court\nheld that the claim at issue was cognizable in a Section 1983\naction because relief on that claim would not necessarily pre-\nvent the State from carrying out its execution.  That is incor-\nrect.  In Nelson, the Court did not classify the prisoner’s\nclaim as a “hybrid” claim—nor could it have, since the pris-\noner was seeking an injunction preventing the State from\nusing the cut-down procedure.  541 U.S. at 648.  Instead, the\nCourt held only that, because the prisoner had “alleged alter-\nnatives that  *  *  *  would have allowed the State to proceed\nwith the execution as scheduled” (and because the prisoner\ncould have brought a similar claim if the State had sought to\n\n18\nuse the cut-down procedure for non-execution-related pur-\nposes), the prisoner’s claim was properly brought as a Section\n1983 action under Preiser and its progeny.  Id. at 643-646.\nOnly after the Court reached that conclusion did the Court\nstate that “our holding here is consistent with our approach\nto civil rights damages actions,” on the ground that “[the pris-\noner’s] challenge to the cut-down procedure would [not] nec-\nessarily prevent Alabama from carrying out its execution.”\nId. at 646-647 (first emphasis added).  Far from characteriz-\ning the claim at issue as a “hybrid” claim, therefore, the Court\nin Nelson merely looked by analogy to its earlier cases involv-\ning such claims, and concluded that the outcome would be the\nsame even under the test applicable to those claims.\nMoreover, Nelson itself confirms that the test applicable\nto “hybrid” claims is not relevant here.  In Nelson, the Court\nreasoned that the “necessarily implies” test was deliberately\nnarrow because “[t]o hold otherwise would have cut off poten-\ntially valid damages actions” that “could otherwise have gone\nforward had the plaintiff not been convicted.”  541 U.S. at 647.\nThat rationale, however, is wholly inapposite where, as here,\nthe claim at issue would not have existed but for the fact that\nthe prisoner had been sentenced to death.  In such a situation,\nthe “hybrid” cases are not directly on point, and the appropri-\nate inquiry is instead simply whether the claim at issue more\nclosely resembles a challenge to a prisoner’s conditions of\nconfinement or a challenge to the fact of confinement (or the\nduration of sentence).\nb. Second, even assuming that this case were properly\nclassified as a “hybrid” case, the “necessarily implies” test is\nsatisfied here.  Petitioner suggests (Br. 20) that the relevant\nquestion is whether his claim would necessarily affect “the\nState’s ability ultimately to carry out the death sentence”\n(emphasis added).  In Nelson, however, the Court stated only\nthat, in the capital context, the appropriate question was\n\n19\nwhether a prisoner’s claim “would necessarily prevent [the\nState] from carrying out its execution.”  541 U.S. at 647.  A\nclaim such as petitioner’s—which identifies no permissible\nalternative methods of execution—does necessarily prevent\nthe State from carrying out its execution in the relevant\nsense:  it necessarily prevents the State from carrying out its\nexecution in a timely manner and in the manner of the State’s\nown choosing.  At a minimum, such a claim creates a sufficient\nlikelihood that an execution will be substantially delayed that,\nparticularly given the State’s interest in “meting out a sen-\ntence of death in a timely fashion” (id. at 644), it should be\ncognizable only in habeas.\nB. Petitioner’s Claim Cannot Proceed In Habeas Corpus\nIn the alternative, petitioner contends (Br. 29-37) that,\neven assuming that his method-of-execution claim is cogniza-\nble only in a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2254,\nthis action should be allowed to proceed because his Section\n1983 complaint may be recharacterized as a “first” petition.\nThat contention is unavailing.\n1. As a preliminary matter, petitioner’s contention that\nhis complaint should be treated as a “first” habeas petition,\nrather than a “second or successive” one, is not fairly included\nin the questions presented.  See Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a).  Both of\nthose questions focus on whether petitioner’s claim is cogniza-\nble in a Section 1983 action—not on whether, if it is not and\nthe  complaint  as  recharacterized  as  a  habeas  petition,  it\nshould be treated as a “first” or “second” one.  See Pet. i.  The\nbody of the certiorari petition supports that interpretation:\nfar from suggesting that his complaint would constitute a\n“first” habeas petition if it were recharacterized, petitioner\nconceded that a recharacterized complaint would “amount[]\nto a successive habeas petition,” and seemingly also conceded\nthat such a petition would be barred.  Pet. 14.\n\n20\nMoreover, although the district court concluded that peti-\ntioner’s Section 1983 action was “the functional equivalent of\na successive habeas corpus petition,” J.A. 12, petitioner does\nnot appear to have challenged that conclusion on appeal, and\ninstead argued only that his claim was cognizable in a Section\n1983 action in the first place.  See J.A. 36-47.  It is therefore\nunsurprising that the court of appeals not only agreed with\nthe district court that petitioner’s claim was not cognizable in\na Section 1983 action, but also agreed that petitioner’s action,\nif recharacterized, would constitute an impermissible “sec-\nond” habeas petition.  J.A. 10.  Because petitioner failed to\nargue below that his recharacterized action should be treated\nas a “first” habeas petition, and failed to present that issue in\nthe petition, the issue is not properly before this Court.  See,\ne.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.S. 103, 109\n(2001) (per curiam); Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 205\n(2001).\n2. In any event, there is no merit to petitioner’s conten-\ntion that this action should be treated as a “first” habeas.\na. In the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), “Congress established a gatekeeping mech-\nanism for the consideration of second or successive habeas\ncorpus  applications  in  the  federal  courts.”    Stewart  v.\nMartinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641 (1998) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citation omitted).  AEDPA specifically pro-\nvides that “[a] claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not pre-\nsented in a prior application shall be dismissed” unless (1) the\nclaim relies on a new rule of constitutional law meeting cer-\ntain requirements or (2) “the factual predicate for the claim\ncould not have been discovered previously through the exer-\ncise of due diligence” and the facts underlying the claim\nwould sufficiently establish that the applicant was not guilty\nof the underlying offense.  28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(2); see 28 U.S.C.\n\n21\n2255 para. 8 (imposing similar limitations on second or succes-\nsive motions under 28 U.S.C. 2255).7\nUnder the plain language of that provision, petitioner’s\nrecharacterized action is unambiguously barred.  That action\nwould constitute a “second” habeas petition, because peti-\ntioner filed a previous habeas petition in 1990, soon after his\nconviction and sentence became final.  See Hill, 175 F.3d at\n919 n.4 (listing claims advanced in first habeas petition).  And\nany “second” habeas petition would not qualify for either ex-\nception to the bar on such petitions.  Although it is true that\nthe “factual predicate” of petitioner’s claim (i.e., that Florida\nwas employing the challenged method of execution) could not\nhave been discovered “until after his federal habeas proceed-\nings were final” (Pet. Br. 13), petitioner does not contend that\nhe could satisfy the conjunctive actual-innocence requirement\nof Section 2244(b)(2)—and, indeed, appears to have conceded\nin his petition that he could not.  See Pet. 14.  Accordingly, the\nlower courts correctly held that petitioner’s recharacterized\naction could not proceed as a habeas petition.\nb. Petitioner contends (Br. 33-35) that, before AEDPA,\nhis recharacterized action could be maintained under the\nabuse-of-the-writ  doctrine, and that the abuse-of-the-writ\ndoctrine “provides the relevant context here.”  That is incor-\nrect.  Before AEDPA, a new claim could validly be presented\nin a successive habeas petition either if the petitioner could\nshow cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim in\nhis earlier petition (e.g., by showing that “the factual or legal\nbasis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel”) or\n7 Before proceeding with a second or successive petition, a petitioner must\napply for leave to file in the court of appeals, making “a prima facie showing”\nthat he satisfies the requirements of either exception.  28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3); see\n28 U.S.C. 2255 para. 8.  Although petitioner sought leave in the court of appeals\nto file a second petition containing other claims, see J.A. 9, he did not seek leave\nto present his method-of-execution claim.\n\n22\nif the petitioner could show that a fundamental miscarriage of\njustice would result from a failure to consider the claim (e.g.,\nby showing that the alleged violation “probably has caused\nthe conviction of one innocent of the crime”).  McCleskey v.\nZant, 499 U.S. 467, 493-494 (1991).\nIn AEDPA, however, Congress overrode that common-law\nstandard  and  unambiguously  required  that  “a  successive\nclaim satisfy both of [the] conditions” discussed in McCleskey.\nRichard H. Fallon, Jr., et al., Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal\nCourts and the Federal System 1386 (5th ed. 2003) (emphasis\nadded).  In Section 2244(b)(2), Congress used the word “and,”\nrather than “or,” to specify the requirements for bringing a\nsuccessive action.  Congress’s tightening of the conditions\nunder  which  prisoners,  including  prisoners  sentenced  to\ndeath, could file second or successive habeas petitions is en-\ntirely consistent with its overarching objective, in enacting\nAEDPA, of “reduc[ing] delays in the execution of state and\nfederal  criminal  sentences,  particularly  in  capital  cases.”\nWoodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003).  A rule that “a\npetition is not second or successive simply because it does not\nviolate the old abuse of the writ doctrine,” therefore, “would\nrun counter to congressional intent.”  Sustache-Rivera v.\nUnited States, 221 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532\nU.S. 924 (2001); see Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996)\n(noting that “judgments about the proper scope of the writ\nare  normally  for  Congress  to  make”)  (internal  quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).\nc. Petitioner further contends (Br. 30) that, in Stewart v.\nMartinez-Villareal, supra, and Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S.\n473 (2000), this Court “rejected the view that § 2244(b) applies\nto all claims brought in a numerically ‘second’ (or subse-\nquent) petition.”  But neither of those cases supports the con-\nsiderably broader proposition advanced by petitioner:  viz.,\nthat a numerically second petition may be treated as a “first”\n\n23\npetition simply because the factual predicate for the underly-\ning claim did not exist at the time of the earlier petition.\nIn Stewart, a prisoner filed a habeas petition contending\nthat he was incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain-\nwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986).  The district court dismissed the\nFord claim, reasoning that it was premature because the pris-\noner’s execution was not imminent.  Several years later, after\nthe State obtained an execution warrant, the prisoner moved\nto reopen his Ford claim.  The district court refused, on the\nground that the motion constituted the equivalent of a second\nor successive habeas petition.  The court of appeals reversed,\nholding that the restrictions on second or successive habeas\npetitions in Section 2244(b) were inapplicable to Ford claims.\nThis Court affirmed, but on a far narrower ground.  The\nCourt reasoned that the prisoner’s filing did not constitute a\nsecond or successive habeas petition, but instead constituted\nmerely a motion to reopen his first petition.  523 U.S. at 643.\nThe Court concluded that AEDPA did not bar the prisoner\nfrom filing such a motion, explaining that the prisoner “was\nentitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his\nearlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal ha-\nbeas relief.”  Ibid.  The Court therefore expressly left open\nthe supplemental question (belatedly) presented by petitioner\nto this Court:  namely, whether a numerically second petition\ncould be treated as a “first” petition where a prisoner’s claim\nwas not “ripe” at the time of the prisoner’s numerically first\npetition (and the prisoner failed to include the claim in the\nearlier petition).  Id. at 645 n.*.\nIn Slack, a prisoner filed a habeas petition containing both\nexhausted and non-exhausted claims.  The district court dis-\nmissed the petition for failure to exhaust.  After the prisoner\nexhausted his remedies in state court, he filed a new petition\nin federal court.  The district court dismissed the petition on\nthe ground that it was second or successive, and the court of\n\n24\nappeals denied a certificate of probable cause.  This Court\nreversed, but again on a narrow ground.  The Court reasoned\nthat, where an initial mixed petition had been dismissed for\nfailure to exhaust, “[i]t is  *  *  *  more appropriate to treat\nthe initial mixed petition as though it had not been filed.”  529\nU.S. at 487-488.  The Court therefore concluded that “[a] peti-\ntion filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed  *  *  *  is\nto be treated as any other first petition and is not a second or\nsuccessive petition.”  Id. at 487 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).  The Court again did not address the ques-\ntion whether a numerically second petition could be treated as\na “first” petition where a prisoner’s claim was not “ripe” at\nthe time of the prisoner’s first petition.\n3. In any event, if petitioner’s action could be treated as\na “first” petition, it is plainly untimely.\na. Method-of-execution claims are different from incom-\npetency claims and are not categorically “unripe” at the mo-\nment a defendant is sentenced to death.  A claim that a pris-\noner is incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain-\nwright, supra, arguably becomes “ripe” only when the pris-\noner’s execution is imminent, insofar as the claim depends on\nthe prisoner’s competency at (or shortly before) the moment\nof execution.  But see Richardson v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 257,\n258 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 942 (2001); Scott v.\nMitchell, 250 F.3d 1011, 1013 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 533 U.S.\n912 (2001).  A claim that the State’s method of execution is\nunconstitutional, however, ordinarily can be brought on direct\nappeal and, if it is rejected, in a prisoner’s first federal habeas\npetition.  For example, if, at the time a prisoner was sen-\ntenced, state law provided that lethal injection was the pri-\nmary method of execution and it was known that the State\nused a particular method of lethal injection, then the prisoner\ncould readily challenge that method in his direct appeal and\nin his first federal habeas petition.  Even if this Court were to\n\n25\nrecognize an exception to the restrictions on second or succes-\nsive habeas petitions for petitions containing “unripe” claims,\ntherefore, method-of-execution claims should fall outside the\nexception where the method of execution being challenged\nwas already in place at the time the prisoner was sentenced.\nIn this case, petitioner could not have brought his particu-\nlar method-of-execution claim on direct appeal or in his 1990\nfederal habeas petition because Florida law at the time pro-\nvided that electrocution, not lethal injection, was the State’s\nmethod of execution.  Petitioner’s particular claim arose, or\n“ripened,” on January 14, 2000, when Florida adopted lethal\ninjection  as  its  preferred  method  of  execution.    See\nRutherford v. Crosby, 438 F.3d 1087, 1092 (11th Cir. 2006)\n(noting that “[t]here has been no suggestion that the lethal\ninjection  chemicals  or  procedures  used  by  Florida  have\nchanged in the last six years”).  AEDPA, however, provides\nthat “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an applica-\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursu-\nant to the judgment of a State court.”  28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1);\nsee 28 U.S.C. 2255 para. 6.  Assuming that the limitations\nperiod could run from the date on which a previously “unripe”\nclaim became “ripe,” the limitations period on petitioner’s\nclaim would have expired on January 14, 2001, one year after\nFlorida’s adoption of lethal injection as its preferred method\nof execution—and more than five years before petitioner filed\nthe instant action.8\n8 AEDPA also provides that “[t]he time during which a properly filed\napplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any\nperiod of limitation under this subsection.”  28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(2).  Petitioner,\nhowever, did not raise his method-of-execution claim in a motion for post-\nconviction relief in state court until December 15, 2005—several years after the\none-year limitations period had run.\n\n26\nTo be sure, AEDPA provides that the limitations period\nruns from the latest of several dates, including “the date on\nwhich the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented\ncould have been discovered through the exercise of due dili-\ngence.”  28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(D); see 28 U.S.C. 2255 para. 6.\nPetitioner notes (Br. 5-6) that, although Florida adopted le-\nthal injection as its method of execution by statute in 2000, it\ndid not specify in that statute exactly how lethal injection\nshould be implemented.  By no later than February 14, 2000,\nhowever, it became known that Florida intended to use the\nsuccession of three chemicals that petitioner now challenges,\nwhen the Florida Supreme Court rejected a similar challenge\nto the constitutionality of Florida’s method of execution (and,\nin so doing, discussed at some length testimony from Florida\nDepartment of Corrections officials providing “specific details\nabout the chemicals to be administered”).  Sims, 754 So. 2d at\n665 & n.17.  At least by that date, therefore, the “factual pred-\nicate” of petitioner’s claims not only “could have been discov-\nered,” but had been publicly disclosed.  Petitioner, however,\ninstead waited almost five years and brought this challenge\njust days before his scheduled execution.9\nEven  assuming,  therefore,  both  that  petitioner’s\nrecharacterized action could be treated as a “first” habeas\npetition and that the limitations period on that petition began\n9 Petitioner notes (Br. 31) that the Florida Department of Corrections had\ndiscretion to determine exactly how his execution would be carried out.  For\npurposes of determining when petitioner’s claim would become “ripe,” however,\nthere is no basis for presuming that the Florida Department of Corrections\nwould deviate from the method disclosed in Sims.  See J.A. 21 n.3 (noting, in\ncomplaint, that “[petitioner] can only assume that the Florida Department of\nCorrections has not changed [its] chemical process since the Sims opinion”).\nSimilarly, a prisoner’s claim more generally challenging execution by lethal\ninjection would not be “unripe” simply because Florida might amend its statute\nat some point before the prisoner’s execution occurred.  There was no reason\nfor petitioner to delay his challenge to the method in place.\n\n27\nto run from the date that the basic protocol of Florida’s\nmethod of execution became known in 2000, petitioner’s action\nis patently untimely and thus barred under AEDPA.10\nC. Even If Petitioner’s Claim Is Cognizable In A Section\n1983 Action, Petitioner Is Not Entitled To Relief\nFinally, even if petitioner’s method-of-execution claim is\nproperly cognizable under Section 1983, petitioner cannot\nproceed with this action for two independent reasons.\n1. As this Court noted in Nelson, “the mere fact that an\ninmate states a cognizable § 1983 claim does not warrant the\nentry of a stay as a matter of right.”  541 U.S. at 649.  In\nGomez v. United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California, 503 U.S. 653 (1992) (per curiam), this\nCourt considered a prisoner’s claim, brought in an eleventh-\nhour Section 1983 action, that execution by gas chamber con-\nstituted cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court noted that\nthe prisoner had filed four prior habeas petitions and that he\nhad “made no convincing showing of cause for his failure to\n10 Petitioner alleges (Br. 8-9, 31) that Florida refused to disclose whether it\nwould use the same succession of chemicals in his own execution.  See J.A. 21\nn.3 (alleging, in complaint, that, “[w]hile [petitioner] requested updated\ninformation from the defendants, such request was refused”).  Even taking\npetitioner’s allegation as true, however, it appears that petitioner waited until\nDecember 8, 2005, to seek confirmation from Florida concerning the proce-\ndures to be used in his execution—long after it became publicly known that\nFlorida was using the succession of chemicals that petitioner now challenges.\nIn the lower courts, but not in his brief before this Court, petitioner relied on\nan article published in The Lancet in support of his contention that his action\nwas timely.  That article, however, at most constitutes evidence supporting\npetitioner’s claim; it does not provide the “factual predicate” for that claim.\nSee, e.g., Jurado v. Burt, 337 F.3d 638, 644 (6th Cir. 2003); Flanagan v.\nJohnson, 154 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1998).  Indeed, other prisoners had\nbrought similar claims well before publication of the Lancet article.  See, e.g.,\nLaGrand v. Lewis, 883 F. Supp. 469, 470 (D. Ariz. 1995), aff’d, 133 F.3d 1253\n(9th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 971 (1998).\n\n28\nraise [the method-of-execution] claim in his prior petitions.”\nId. at 653.  The Court, however, ultimately did not decide\nwhether the prisoner should have brought his claim in a Sec-\ntion 1983 action or a habeas petition.  Instead, the Court\nnoted that the prisoner was “seek[ing] an equitable remedy”\nand that “[e]quity must take into consideration the State’s\nstrong interest in proceeding with its judgment and [the pris-\noner’s] obvious attempt at manipulation.”  Id. at 654.  The\nCourt observed that “[t]his claim could have been brought\nmore than a decade ago” and that “[t]here is no good reason\nfor this abusive delay, which has been compounded by last-\nminute attempts to manipulate the judicial process.”  Ibid.\nOn that basis, the Court vacated the court of appeals’ stay of\nthe prisoner’s execution.  Ibid.  Gomez thus stands for the\nproposition that “there is a strong equitable presumption\nagainst the grant of a stay where a claim could have been\nbrought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits\nwithout requiring entry of a stay.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 650.\nConsistent with Gomez, courts of appeals have frequently\ndenied equitable relief on eleventh-hour method-of-execution\nclaims.  See, e.g., Rutherford, 438 F.3d at 1089-1093; White v.\nJohnson, 429 F.3d 572, 573-574 (5th Cir. 2005); Sapp, 118 F.3d\nat 462-464.  There is no justification for a different result\nhere.  For essentially the same reasons that petitioner’s ac-\ntion would be untimely even if it were recharacterized as a\n“first” habeas petition, petitioner would not be entitled to\nequitable relief even if his action were properly brought under\nSection 1983.  Because petitioner could have brought his\nmethod-of-execution claim at any point after Florida adopted\nlethal injection as its preferred method of execution and it\nbecame known that Florida intended to use the succession of\nthree chemicals that petitioner now challenges, this case is\ndirectly analogous to Gomez.  Moreover, petitioner was con-\nvicted of his capital offense more than 22 years ago, and long\n\n29\nago completed his direct appeal and first rounds of state and\nfederal collateral review.  Because petitioner’s action consti-\ntutes nothing more than a “last-minute attempt[] to manipu-\nlate the judicial process” (Gomez, 503 U.S. at 654), the lower\ncourts correctly denied petitioner equitable relief.11\n2. In addition, as this Court also noted in Nelson (541\nU.S. at 650), the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA)\nprohibits an inmate from bringing a Section 1983 action con-\ncerning prison conditions until “such administrative remedies\nas are available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. 1997e(a).  Peti-\ntioner concededly has not sought to exhaust any administra-\ntive remedies available within the Florida prison system.\nInstead, petitioner contended in his complaint only that it was\nnot necessary for him to exhaust his administrative remedies\nbecause “the lethal injection procedure at issue is a prospec-\ntive violation of his constitutional rights, not ripe for adminis-\ntrative remedy.”  J.A. 17.  As discussed above, however, it is\nclear that petitioner’s claim was “ripe” by no later than 2000,\nwhen petitioner knew, or should have known, that Florida was\nusing the succession of three chemicals that he now chal-\nlenges.  Petitioner’s failure to exhaust his administrative rem-\nedies therefore constitutes yet another basis to uphold the\nlower courts’ dismissal of this action.\nThe PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is particularly im-\nportant in this context.  Where a prisoner challenges a partic-\nular method of execution and identifies an alternative, per-\nmissible method of execution (and so brings the claim within\nSection 1983), the exhaustion requirement affords the State\n11 The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, enacted after this Court’s\ndecision in Gomez, similarly specifies that, in deciding whether to issue\npreliminary or permanent injunctive relief in a Section 1983 action concerning\nprison conditions, “[t]he court shall give substantial weight to any adverse\nimpact on  *  *  *  the operation of a criminal justice system caused by [any\ninjunction].”  18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(1), 3626(a)(2).\n\n30\nan opportunity to consider whether the proposed alternative\nmethod would in fact be permissible.  Moreover, if the identi-\nfied alternative is feasible, federal-court involvement may be\nunnecessary.  For example, if petitioner identified a higher\ndose of sodium pentothal that in his view would be sufficient,\nthe State may have been able to accommodate that request.\nHere, of course, petitioner did not identify any alternative\nmethod of execution.  The exhaustion requirement still would\nhave permitted the State an opportunity to consider peti-\ntioner’s claim.  But more fundamentally, as discussed above,\na prisoner’s challenge to the method of execution employed by\nthe State which does not identify any permissible, alternative\nmethod of execution is properly characterized as a challenge\nto  his  execution  per  se.    That  kind  of  challenge  may  be\nbrought only in habeas.\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted.\nPAUL D.

For the reasons set forth below,\nthe Court finds the motion should be denied.\nHill does not specify whether his motion for reconsideration is brought\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 or 60.  The major distinction\nbetween the two is that Rule 59 “applies to motions for reconsideration of matters\nencompassed in a decision on the merits of the dispute, and not matters\ncollateral to the merits.”  Lucas v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 729 F.2d 1300, 1301\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 47     Filed 09/11/2006     Page 2 of 3(cid:10)\nPage 2 of 3\n(11th Cir. 1984).  Because Hill argues that this Court has “misapprehended and\nmistaken several issues of law and fact” (doc. 43-1 at 2), he is attacking “matters\nencompassed in a decision on the merits of the dispute”; thus, his motion for\nreconsideration will be treated as one arising under Rule 59(e).\n“The only grounds for granting a [Rule 59(e)] motion are newly-discovered\nevidence or manifest errors of law or fact.”  In re Kellogg, 197 F.3d 1116, 1119\n(11th Cir. 1999).  This rule “may not be used to relitigate a claim.”  Fry v.\nHillsborough County Sch. Bd., 2006 WL 2034967 at *7 (11th Cir. Jul. 20,\n2006)(citing Mincey v. Head, 206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000)).  \nHill’s emotionally-laden arguments raise no new evidence, instead making\ncomplaints under headings such as the following: “Truncated Consideration by\nThis Court Did Not Provide Mr. Hill Due Process in Litigating His § 1983 Claim.”1 \nHill insinuates that this Court’s timeliness in rendering an order indicates\ninsufficient deliberation on the issues presented.  However, Hill filed his original\nmotion for preliminary injunction in January of 2006.  This Court has kept current\nsince that time (and before) with opinions issued by our nation’s courts on the\nquestion of Eighth Amendment concerns in the context of lethal injection.  The\nCourt has thoroughly examined relevant opinions, both state and federal, and\n1  The only point raised by Hill that bears mention is his insistence that he could not have\nbrought his § 1983 action until his death warrant was signed, because it was only then that he\ncould determine the specific means by which the State would carry out his execution.  This point\nnecessarily assumes that the State arbitrarily and capriciously (or secretly) changes its chemical\ncocktail on a regular basis.  Even assuming that Hill was not previously aware of Florida’s\nprocedures for lethal injection, the 1999 Sims case detailed the procedure from beginning to end,\nthus providing Hill with the information necessary to bring his case at that time.  His decision to\nwait until four days before his execution to file his motion does not entitle him either to a stay or to\na reconsideration of this Court’s previous rulings.\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 47     Filed 09/11/2006     Page 3 of 3(cid:10)\nPage 3 of 3\napplied them in a consistent manner to the facts presented in this case.  All\nparties should rest assured that this Court has given careful and searching\nconsideration to these weighty matters in rendering its decisions.\nHill has simply not made any showing of manifest error of law or fact in the\nCourt’s order; rather, it appears that Hill is engaging in dilatory tactics to delay a\ndeath sentence that was imposed for a second time in 1986—two decades ago. \nAs the United States Supreme Court stated in Hill v. McDonough, “The federal\ncourts can and should protect States from dilatory or speculative suits.”  Hill, 126\nS.Ct. at 2104.  Based on the foregoing, it is\nORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration\n(doc. 43) and motion for stay (attachment 1 to doc. 44) are hereby denied.\nDONE AND ORDERED this eleventh day of September, 2006.\n   s/ Stephan P.

Mr. Hill’s execution is presently scheduled\nfor September 20, 2006 at 6:00 p.m.\nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAppellant, Clarence Hill, was convicted of first degree\nmurder in 1983.  On appeal, his conviction was affirmed, but his\nsentence was vacated.  Following a second sentencing proceeding,\nMr. Hill was again sentenced to death, and the Florida Supreme\nCourt affirmed. Hill v. State, 515 So.2d 176 (Fla. 1987), cert.\ndenied, Hill v. State, 108 S.Ct. 1302 (1988).\n-1-\n\nOn November 9, 1989, the Governor of Florida signed a death\nwarrant scheduling Mr. Hill’s execution for January 25, 1990.   \nMr. Hill filed an expedited postconviction motion, which was\ndenied on January 18, 1990.  On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court\ndenied relief. Hill v. State, 556 So. 2d 1385 (Fla. 1990).\nMr. Hill subsequently filed a Motion to Stay Execution and a\nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Florida on January 27, 1990. \nAfter granting a stay of execution, on August 31, 1992, the \ndistrict court granted relief to Mr. Hill on a sentencing issue.\nOn remand, the Florida Supreme Court again denied relief.\nHill v. State, 643 So. 2d 1071 (Fla. 1995).  Mr. Hill’s\nsubsequent state and federal applications, including his federal\nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, were unsuccessful. See Hill\nv. Moore, 175 F.3d 915 (11th Cir. 1999), Hill v. State, 528 U.S.\n1087 (2000), Hill v. State, 2006 Fla. LEXIS 8 (January 17, 2006).\nOn Friday, January 20, 2006, Mr. Hill brought an action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Florida, Tallahassee Division.  Mr. Hill\nalleged violations of his right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution.  On Saturday, January 21, 2006, the\ndistrict court dismissed Mr. Hill’s complaint for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for lack of jurisdiction.  Thereafter, on\n-2-\n\nMonday, January 23, 2006, Mr. Hill filed a Notice of Appeal and\nby separate pleading an application for stay of execution.  On\nJanuary 24, 2006, this Court denied his application for stay.\nThis Court went on to hold that Mr. Hill’s action was a\nsuccessive petition for a writ of habeas corpus and that any\napplication for leave to file a successive petition would be\ndenied under § 2244(b)(2).  Hill v. Crosby, 437 F.3rd 1084, 2006\nU.S. App. LEXIS 1674 (11th Cir. Fla., 2006).\nMr. Hill then filed a petition for certiorari review and an\napplication for stay by separate pleading in the Supreme Court of\nthe United States.  At 7:00 p.m., January 24, 2006, Justice\nKennedy issued a stay until the full court could consider Mr.\nHill’s pleadings.  The following day, January 25, 2006, the full\ncourt granted Mr. Hill a stay and granted certiorari.  The stay\nwas to remain in effect until the Supreme Court of the United\nStates rendered a decision in the case.  Hill v. Crosby, 126\nS.Ct. 1189, 163 L.Ed.2d 1144, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 1074 (January 25,\n2006).  Subsequently, the Court rendered a 9-0 decision that\nreversed and remanded the cause back to this Court for\nproceedings consistent with the opinion.  Hill v. McDonough, 126\nS.Ct 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 4674 (June 12, 2006).\nThe Supreme Court held that Mr. Hill’s claim under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 was essentially comparable to that brought in Nelson v.\nCampbell, 541 U.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004), \n-3-\n\nand that Mr. Hill should be allowed to proceed under § 1983.  See\nHill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44, 2006 U.S. LEXIS\n4674 (June 12, 2006).  The Supreme Court’s decision became final\non July 14, 2006.\nA panel of this Court received the case on remand on July\n18, 2006.  On August 17, 2006, the State of Florida arbitrarily\nscheduled Mr. Hill’s execution date for September 20, 2006. \nThereafter, Mr. Hill filed in this Court his Motion for Immediate\nRemand of This Cause to the District Court, via overnight mail on\nAugust 23, 2006.  This Court then remanded this cause on August\n29, 2006 to the District Court, with the mandate being received\non August 30, 2006.\nUndersigned counsel’s office was contacted by telephone by\nthe district court on August 31, 2006.  At the time of the call,\nundersigned counsel was out of town conducting attorney visits\nwith clients on Florida’s Death Row, including Mr. Hill.\nUndersigned counsel then arrived back at his office at\napproximately 5:00 p.m.  At this time, undersigned learned\nthrough his assistant of the district court’s directive that all\npleadings in this matter were to be filed by the parties prior to\n12:00 p.m., September 1, 2006.  Undersigned counsel, a sole\npractitioner, then had less than twenty-four hours to comply with\nthe district court’s order. Subsequently, Mr. Hill filed a motion\nto file an amended complaint, an amended complaint, a motion for\n-4-\n\nexpedited discovery, propounded interrogatories, requested\nadmissions, requested production, moved for a temporary\ninjunction staying Mr. Hill’s execution.  On that very same date,\nSeptember 1, 2006, the district court entered its Order\nDismissing Complaint.  On September 11, 2006, the district court\nissued an Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for\nStay. \nII. BASIS FOR STAY OF EXECUTION\nIn Hill, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the requirements\nfor a stay of execution stated in Nelson and Gomez v. United\nStates Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.S. 653, 654,\n122 S.Ct. 1652, 118 L.Ed.2d 293 (1992) (per curiam) should be\nfollowed.  Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct 2096, *2104, 165 L.Ed.2d\n44, **54, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 4674, ***21 (2006).  In the past, this\nCourt has determined whether a stay of execution should be\ngranted by utilizing a four-part test that generally comports\nwith Gomez: \nwhether the movant has made a showing of likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits and of irreparable injury if the\nstay is not granted, whether the stay would\nsubstantially harm other parties, and whether granting\nthe stay would serve the public interest. \n \nBundy v. Wainwright, 808 F. 2d 1410, 1421 (11th Cir. 1987).  \nMr. Hill has met the standards attendant to the granting of\na stay of his execution.  The Supreme Court of the United States\nconsidered these same factors when granting Mr. Hill a stay to\n-5-\n\nconsider the case which eventually led to its reversing this\nCourt’s decision and remanding it back for consideration\nconsistent with its opinion.  Each of the Gomez criteria are\nsatisfied in this case.\nA. IRREPARABLE INJURY\nIf the requested stay is not issued, Mr. Hill will be\nexecuted at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, September 20, 2006.  This\nexecution will carry an unacceptably high risk of being conducted\nin a torturous manner in violation of Mr. Hill’s Eighth Amendment\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  This\nconstitutes irreparable injury.  See, e.q., Evans v. Bennett, 440\nU.S. 1301, 1306 (1979) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice, granting a\nstay of execution and noting the “obviously irreversible nature\nof the death penalty”); O’Bryan v. Estelle, 691 F.2d 706, 708\n(5th Cir. 1982) (the “irreversible nature of the death penalty”\nconstitutes irreparable injury and weighs heavily in favor of\ngranting a stay); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir.\n1996) (holding that continued pain and suffering resulting from\ndeliberate medical indifference is irreparable harm). \nAdditionally, the State’s violation of Mr. Hill’s Eighth\nAmendment rights alone validates a presumption of irreparable\nharm.  See Associated General Contractor’s of California, Inc. v.\nCoalition for Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1412 (9th Cir.\n1991) (an alleged constitutional infringement will often alone\n-6-\n\nconstitute irreparable harm).\nB. HARM TO OTHER PARTIES\nThere will be no harm to other parties if a stay of\nexecution is granted.  Mr. Hill will remain in custody at Florida\nState Prison, where he has been held since his conviction and,\nmost recently, since the stay of execution was entered by the\nSupreme Court of the United States on January 25, 2006.  A\nrelatively brief continuation of the status quo will cause\nabsolutely no harm to other parties.  See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Ct.\nFor Northern Dist. Of Cal., 966 F.2d 460, 462 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(Noonan, J., dissenting from grant of writ of mandate) (“The\nstate will get its man in the end.  In contrast, if persons are\nput to death in a manner that is determined to be cruel, they\nsuffer injury that can never be undone, and the Constitution\nsuffers an injury that can never be repaired.”)\nC. PUBLIC INTEREST\nAlthough there are competing public interests, ultimately\none factor favors the issuance of the temporary relief sought. \nCertainly, the public has an interest in the execution of Mr.\nHill pursuant to the judgment of the Florida Courts.  More\nimportantly, however, it has an interest in determining that Mr.\nHill’s execution will be carried out consistent the with\nrequirements of the Eighth Amendment.  Additionally, the State\nhas an interest in not subjecting Mr. Hill to the excruciating\n-7-\n\nand torturous pain likely involved in the lethal injection\nprocess Florida intends upon utilizing.  See Sims v. State, 754\nSo.2d 657 (Fla. 2000).  It is therefore paramount that Mr. Hill’s\nweighty constitutional claims be resolved on the merits.  \nBy arbitrarily setting an execution date while this case was\nawaiting remand, the State has attempted to manipulate the\nprocess and kill Mr. Hill before its unconstitutional method of\nexecution is reviewed on the merits.  The temporary delay in\ncarrying out the execution, which will be necessitated by review\nand consideration of the merits of Mr. Hill’s case, is a small\nprice to pay to assure fairness in this critical aspect of\ncarrying out Mr. Hill’s sentence.\nThe State of Florida created the current supposed time bind\nby setting an execution date rather than simply moving to remand\nthis cause to the district court for a full and fair hearing. \nSee Appendix A & B.  In letters exchanged between the Office of\nthe Governor and the Attorney General, the letter written by\nAttorney General Crist states in reference to this cause, “The\ncase has been remanded to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\non the complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, however no\nfurther action has occurred.”  Appendix B at 2.  This letter was\npenned a mere thirty-four days after this Court received the\nremand from the Supreme Court of the United States.  Mr. Hill was\nanticipating that this Court would remand his cause to the\n-8-\n\ndistrict court and was simply waiting for notification of such\nremand.  Mr. Hill was shocked that the Governor of Florida would\nset an execution date without this cause being fully litigated,\nespecially in light of the problems being exposed in the lethal\ninjection process in cases around the country, and the likelihood\nhe will experience a torturous death under Florida’s current\nlethal injection procedure.  See infra.\nThe State of Florida has rescheduled Mr. Hill’s execution in\norder to obtain a strategic advantage in his § 1983 suit.  Its\nactions will deprive Mr. Hill of his right to pursue his claims,\nthereby achieving its ultimate goal – to prevent Florida’s lethal\ninjection procedure from being subjected to any meaningful\nscrutiny.  The equities have now certainly been reversed from\nwhen this cause was entertained by the district court in January. \nInstead of Mr. Hill filing his lawsuit when his execution was\nimminent, the State of Florida now has scheduled his execution\nafter his lawsuit was allowed to go forward in an apparent\nattempt to preclude judicial resolution. \nThe analysis under Gomez changed when the original execution\ndate was stayed on January 25, 2006.  In contrast to when the\nSupreme Court of the United States voted unanimously to stay this\ncause and grant certiorari, after the remand in January of 2006\nMr. Hill was not initially operating under an imminent execution\ndate.  Thirty-four days after the remand, the Governor of Florida\n-9-\n\nset an execution date to “get things going in the courts,” rather\nthan filing a motion for remand. This action presents a different\nset of equities than what this Court considered when originally\ndenying Mr. Hill’s request to stay his execution.  The State of\nFlorida’s action, not Mr. Hill’s, abrogated Mr. Hill’s ability to\nadequately develop a factual record as requested in this cause. \nThe State’s actions should not unduly prejudice Mr. Hill by\npreventing him from pursuing his constitutional claim to the\nfullest extent of the law.  \nPer Governor Bush’s orders, the State of Florida did not\nproceed with any further death warrants while Mr. Hill’s case was \npending. The State’s “strong interest in enforcing its criminal\njudgments . . .” (See Hill v. McDonough at 2104) was voluntarily\nand volitionally decided to be of less importance than the issues\nsurrounding lethal injection.  However, by now resetting Mr.\nHill’s execution date, while continuing to hold all other\nwarrants in abeyance, the intent of the State of Florida is\nobvious – kill Mr. Hill, and prevent a reasoned review of the\ntorturous lethal injection process currently in place.  \nThe State of Florida’s conduct has only served to delay and\nobstruct the proper resolution of Mr. Hill’s claims.  By setting\nan execution date for Mr. Hill, Florida has short-circuited the\nnormal course of litigation – a course of litigation which was\nanticipated by the United States Supreme Court when it stayed Mr.\n-10-\n\nHill’s execution and remanded this case.  The State’s action\nbelies its publicly stated intent of awaiting a judicial\nresolution of this matter, and evinces its true intent of not\nallowing a judicial review of its lethal injection procedure. \nIt should be noted that two Supreme Court justices\nrecognized that the State has a responsibility to ensure that its\nexecution method comports with the Constitution.  As Justice\nKennedy stated in oral argument in Hill v. McDonough, “This --\nthis is a death case. . . . Doesn't the State have some minimal\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment to do the necessary\nresearch to assure that this is the most humane method possible? \nDoesn't the State have a minimal obligation on its own to do\nthat?\" Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165\nL.Ed.2d 44 (2006), Oral Argument transcript at 29.\nSimilarly, Justice Souter queried the assistant solicitor\ngeneral on what he believed to be the State’s duty to\ninvestigate:\n[T]he Lancet article has been out there for a while,\nand it certainly is enough to suggest. . .that there is\nsomething problematic about the manner in which Florida\nproposes to do this.  And yet, we have not heard a word\nthat Florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an\nalternative or, for that matter, to – to disprove what\nthe Lancet article suggests. Id. at 48.\nBy ordering Mr. Hill to be executed on September 20, 2006, the\nState of Florida is willfully disregarding the very real\npossibility that Mr. Hill will be executed cruelly, painfully,\n-11-\n\nand unconstitutionally.  The State’s blatant attempt to avoid\naddressing this serious constitutional and civil rights issue\nsignificantly lessens the equitable weight that would generally\nbe afforded a State when an execution date is imminent.  This\nCourt should re-weigh the equities accordingly, and find that\nequitable process mandates reversing and remanding this cause for\nan evidentiary hearing.1\nD. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MR. HILL WILL PREVAIL ON THE MERITS\nThe likelihood that Mr. Hill will prevail on the merits of\nhis claims is demonstrated by recent developments in litigation\nsurrounding lethal injection.  See, e.g., Taylor v. Crawford,\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42949, 22 (June 26, 2006).  Additionally,\nthere is now empirical, scientific evidence establishing that the\nchemical process for lethal injection (utilized in accordance\nwith the Florida Department of Correction’s protocol) creates a\nforeseeable risk of the gratuitous and unnecessary infliction of\npain on a person being executed.  See Koniaris L.G., Zimmers\nT.A., Lubarski D.A., Sheldon J.P., Inadequate anaesthesia in\nlethal injection for execution, Vol 365, THE LANCET 1412-14\n(April 16, 2005).  \n1Judicial resolution is necessary.  One of two outcomes will\nresult:  Either the State of Florida’s execution procedure will\nwithstand constitutional scrutiny and remain in place; or, more\nlikely, it will crumble under constitutional scrutiny and be\nmodified to prevent the State of Florida from torturously\nexecuting the condemned. \n-12-\n\n1. Empirical, scientific evidence now shows that the\nlethal injection procedure used by the Florida\nDepartment of Corrections creates an unnecessary,\nunconstitutional, and foreseeable risk of pain\nduring an execution.\nThe likelihood that Mr. Hill will prevail on the merits of\nhis claims is demonstrated by empirical, scientific evidence\nestablishing that the chemical process for lethal injection\nutilized in accordance with the Florida Department of\nCorrection’s (hereinafter “DOC”) protocol, creates a foreseeable\nrisk of the gratuitous and unnecessary infliction of pain on a\nperson being executed. \nA recent study published in the world-renowned medical\njournal THE LANCET by Dr. David A. Lubarsky (whose declaration\nwas attached to Mr. Hill’s Complaint) and three co-authors\ndetailed the results of their research on the effects of\nchemicals in lethal injections.  See Koniaris L.G., Zimmers T.A.,\nLubarski D.A., Sheldon J.P., Inadequate anaesthesia in lethal\ninjection for execution, Vol 365, THE LANCET 1412-14 (April 16,\n2005).  This study confirmed, through the analysis of empirical\nafter-the-fact data, that the scientific critique of the use of\nsodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride\ncreates a foreseeable risk of the gratuitous and unnecessary\ninfliction of pain on a person being executed.2  The authors\n2 Dr. Lubarski has noted that each of the opinions set forth in\nthe LANCET study reflects his opinion to a reasonable degree of\n-13-\n\nfound that in toxicology reports in the cases they studied, post-\nmortem concentrations of thiopental in the blood were lower than\nthat required for surgery in 43 of 49 executed inmates (88%). \nMoreover, 21 of the 49 executed inmates (43%) had concentrations\nconsistent with awareness, as the inmates had an inadequate\namount of sodium pentothal in their bloodstream to provide\nanesthesia. (Complaint, Att. B).  In other words, in close to\nhalf of the cases, the prisoner felt the suffering of suffocation\nfrom pancuronium bromide, and the burning through the veins\nfollowed by a heart attack caused by the potassium chloride. As\nnoted in Mr. Hill’s Complaint, the chemical process utilized in\nexecutions in Florida is identical to that identified in the\nstudy.\nAs explained in the declaration of Dr. Lubarsky, sodium\npentothal is an ultra-short acting substance which produces\nshallow anesthesia. (Complaint, Att. A).  Health-care\nprofessionals use it as an initial anesthetic in preparation for\nsurgery while they set up a breathing tube in the patient and use\ndifferent drugs to bring the patient to a “surgical plane” of\nanesthesia that will last through the operation and will block\nthe stimuli of surgery which would otherwise cause pain.  Sodium\npentothal is intended to be defeasible by stimuli associated with\nerrors in setting up the breathing tube and initiating the\nscientific certainty. (Complaint, Att. A).\n-14-\n\nlong-run, deep anesthesia; the patient is supposed to be able to\nwake up and signal the staff that something is wrong.\nThe second chemical used in lethal injections in Florida is\npancuronium bromide, sometimes referred to simply as pancuronium.\nIt is not an anesthetic.  It is a paralytic agent, which stops\n the breathing.  Its purpose is merely cosmetic, as it masks the\neffects of the application of the lethal chemical, potassium\nchloride, to the condemned.  It is,quite simply, unnecessary to\nbring about the death of a person being executed by lethal\ninjection. (Complaint, Att. A).  Pancuronium has two\ncontradictory effects:  First, it causes the person to whom it is\napplied to suffer suffocation when the lungs stop moving; and\nsecond, it prevents the person from manifesting this suffering,\nor any other sensation, by facial expression, hand movement, or\nspeech. (Complaint, Att. A). \nThe third chemical, potassium chloride, is the substance\nthat causes the death of the prisoner by cardiac arrest.  It\nburns intensely as it courses through the veins toward the heart,\ncausing massive muscle cramping and excruciating pain along the\nway.  (Complaint, Att. A).  When the potassium chloride reaches\nthe heart, it causes a heart attack.  If the anesthesia has worn\noff by that time, the condemned feels all of this pain, as well\nas the pain of a heart attack.  However, in this case, Mr. Hill\nwill be unable to communicate his pain because the pancuronium\n-15-\n\nwill have paralyzed his entire body so that he cannot express\nhimself, verbally or otherwise. (Complaint, Att. A).\nDoctors and physicians who entered Mr. Hill’s case as Amici\nCuriae before the Supreme Court of the United States concluded as\nfollows:\nThe combination of chemicals administered by the state\nof Florida to executing condemned inmates -- i.e., the\nsequential  intravenous  administration  of  sodium\nthiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride --\nis widely used by the United States jurisdictions that\nexecute  condemned  inmates  by  lethal  injection.  See\nAbdur’Rahman  v.  Bredesen,  181  S.W.3d  292,  307  (Tenn.\n2005) (“the undisputed evidence before the Chancellor was\nthat only two states do not use some combination” of\nthese  chemicals  in  lethal  injection).  If  improperly\nadministered, this combination of chemicals will cause\ninhuman suffering on the part of the inmate prior to his\ndeath.  And the procedures by which lethal injection is\nadministered in jurisdictions across the country create\na significant likelihood that the three-drug procedure\nwill  be  administered  in  a  manner  that  causes  such\nsuffering on the part of at least some inmates prior to\ntheir death.  \nBoth  sodium  thiopental  and  pancuronium  bromide  can\ncause respiratory arrest and be lethal, but the injection\nof  potassium  chloride  shortly  after  the  injection  of\nsodium  thiopental  and  pancuronium  bromide  normally\nensures  that  death  occurs  by  cardiac  arrest  before\nrespiratory arrest occurs.  Thus, in all lethal injection\njurisdictions,  potassium chloride is the agent intended\nto bring about the inmate’s death.  Sodium thiopental is\nadministered as an anesthetic, and pancuronium bromide is\nadministered for “cosmetic” or “aesthetic” reasons; i.e.,\nto make the prisoner appear serene.\n  \nIn  the  doses  and  concentrations  in  which  it  is\nadministered in the lethal injection process, potassium\nchloride is - absent adequate anesthesia – indescribably\n-16-\n\npainful.    It  “scours  the  nerve  fibers  lining  [the\ninmate’s] veins,” Evans v. Saar, 2006 WL 274476 (D. Md.\nFebruary 1, 2006), and interrupts the heart’s signaling\nfunction, interfering with its rhythmic contractions and\ncausing a massive coronary arrest.   Administering this\nquantity of potassium chloride to a conscious individual\nwould, in addition to precipitating a painful coronary\narrest, result in an excruciating burning pain, extending\nfrom the site of the injection (normally an arm, hand,\nleg or foot) to the heart, and would constitute the most\nsevere form of torture.\n \nThe administration of pancuronium bromide during the\nlethal injection process greatly increases the likelihood\nthat the inmate will suffer agonizing pain.  Although it\nmakes the inmate incapable of any voluntary movement, and\neven  of  breathing,  pancuronium  bromide  has  no  effect\nwhatsoever on awareness, cognition or sensation.  As a\nresult, an individual to whom pancuronium bromide has\nbeen administered, but who is not properly anesthetized,\nwill endure the terror of conscious paralysis, with no\nability to struggle or communicate to anyone else that he\nis conscious and feels pain.  An inmate undergoing lethal\ninjection  to  whom  pancuronium  bromide  has  been\nadministered, and who is not properly anesthetized, would\nsuffocate while experiencing (consciously) the blinding\npain of an injection of potassium chloride and a massive\nheart  attack,  while  onlookers  believed  him  to  be\nunconscious and insensitive to any pain.\nAlthough an inmate who is properly anesthetized will\nnot consciously experience the pain and terror associated\nwith  injections  of  pancuronium  bromide  and  potassium\nchloride, their injection into the veins of an individual\nwho is not sufficiently anesthetized would cause horrible\nsuffering.  Therefore, unless the inmate is brought to an\nappropriate anesthetic depth by the injection of sodium\nthiopental,  and  unless  that  depth  is  maintained\nthroughout the lethal injection process, the inmate will\nendure savage torment.\n  \n    However,  achieving  and  maintaining  an  appropriate\nanesthetic depth is an extraordinarily complex endeavor,\n-17-\n\nwhich requires specialized training and procedures, and\nequipment.  If adequately trained personnel, appropriate\nprocedures  and  proper  equipment  are  not  employed\nthroughout the lethal injection process, there is a great\nlikelihood that tremendous agony will be inflicted upon\nsome inmates in the course of any significant number of\nexecutions.  \nSee  Brief  of  Amici  Curiae  Physicians  for  Human  Rights,  Global\nLawyers and Physicians, Lawrence D. Egbert, M.D., and Andrew Gumbs,\nM.D., pp. 5-7, Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44,\n2006 U.S. LEXIS 4674 (June 12, 2006).  \nAs explained by Dr. Lubarsky, because Florida’s practices\nare substantially similar to those of the lethal injection\njurisdictions which conducted autopsies and toxicology reports,\nkept records of them, and disclosed them to the LANCET scholars,\nthere is at least the same risk (43%) as in those jurisdictions\nthat Mr. Hill will not be anesthetized at the time of his death.\n(Complaint, Att. A). \nHere, the appellees are acting under color of Florida law by\nusing a succession of three chemicals that will cause unnecessary\npain in the execution of a sentence of death, which they have\nadmitted to be their practice, which is unnecessary as a means of\nemploying lethal injection, and which creates a foreseeable risk\nof inflicting unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain contrary\nto contemporary standards of decency.\n  The Eighth Amendment “proscribes more than physically\nbarbarous punishments.”  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102\n-18-\n\n(1976).  It prohibits the risk of punishments that “involve the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” or “torture or a\nlingering death,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976);\nLouisiana ex. rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). \n“Among the ‘unnecessary and wanton’ inflictions of pain are those\nthat are ‘totally without penological justification.’” Rhodes v.\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981).  The Eighth Amendment reaches\n“exercises of cruelty by laws other than those which inflict\nbodily pain or mutilation.”  Weems v. United States, 217 U.S.\n349, 373 (1909).  It forbids laws subjecting a person to\n“circumstance[s] of degradation,” Id. at 366, or to\n“circumstances of terror, pain, or disgrace” “superadded” to a\nsentence of death. Id. at 370 (emphasis added).  \nUnder the present circumstances, given the fact that Mr.\nHill possesses scientific evidence proving his claim, he will\nlikely succeed on the merits of the issue; that is, he will be\nunnecessarily subjected to a substantial risk of wanton\ninfliction of pain, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. \n2. Recent developments in litigation surrounding\nlethal injection since the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States stayed Mr. Hill’s execution on\nJanuary 25, 2006 demonstrate a likelihood that Mr.\nHill will prevail on the merits.3\n3 As will be discussed herein, these recent developments also\ndemonstrate the necessity of a stay of execution and the granting\nof discovery. \n-19-\n\n  \nSince the stay in Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 163\nL.Ed.2d 1144, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 1074 (January 25, 2006), an\nevidentiary hearing was held in Missouri, and discovery conducted\nregarding Missouri’s recent executions.  The case involved\nMichael Taylor, a condemned inmate challenging the lethal\ninjection protocol used in Missouri executions.  Information was\nrevealed which showed that “unacceptable” risks existed in\nMissouri’s execution procedures that may cause a condemned inmate\nunconstitutional pain and suffering.  See Taylor v. Crawford,\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42949, 22 (June 26, 2006).  The Court\nsuccinctly summarized the value of the discovery materials in\nTaylor as follows:\n  After learning more about how executions are carried\nout in Missouri, through the interrogatories submitted\nto the John Doe defendants, reviewing the chemical\ndispensary logs, reviewing the videotape of the\nexecution chamber and listening to the testimony of\nJohn Doe I, and to the testimony of the other expert\nwitnesses at the June 12-13, 2006 hearing, it is\napparent that there are numerous problems.  Id. at *19.\nThese problems included: \n1) no written protocol existed describing which drugs were\nadministered, the dosage to be used, and the method of\nadministration; \n2) the State had misrepresented the amount of sodium\nthiopental that had been administered in recent executions; five\n-20-\n\n(5) grams was to have been administered, but only two and a half\n(2.5) grams were actually administered; \n3) the doctor overseeing the executions was not an\nanesthesiologist, but rather a surgeon, who was not well versed\nin mixing and dissolving the chemicals used in the execution\nprotocol and who believed he could modify the amount of chemicals\nand/or protocol at his discretion; \n4) there is no means to monitor the anesthetic depth of the\ncondemned during the execution procedure. \n5) there are no checks and balances or oversight at any\npoint in the process. Id. at 19-21. \nThe Court observed, “It is obvious that the protocol as it\ncurrently exists is not carried out consistently and is subject\nto change at a moments notice.” Id. at *19. \nThe Taylor case is illustrative of the problems with the\nMissouri protocol, which is virtually identical to the procedures\nused in Florida.  Of particular note is the Taylor court’s\nconcern that the amount of sodium pentothal had been decreased\nfrom five (5) grams to two and a half (2.5) grams.  Yet,\nappallingly, this is still more than the State of Florida intends\nto administer in Mr. Hill’s execution. Florida officials will not\nuse less than two grams of sodium pentothal. See Sims  v. State,\n754 So.2d 657 (Fla. 2000).  Further, Taylor shows the importance\nof being provided discovery about execution procedures as well as\n-21-\n\ninformation about recent executions – information to which Mr.\nHill has so far completely been denied access. \nAdditionally, the procedural history in Mr. Taylor’s case is\ninstructive as to the perils of attempting to litigate lethal\ninjection claims at a moment’s notice when a state arbitrarily\nsets an execution date to gain an advantage in a §1983 lethal\ninjection case.  During the pendency of Mr. Taylor’s lethal\ninjection challenge, the State of Missouri arbitrarily set an\nexecution date on January 3, 2006 for February 1, 2006.  See\nTaylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006).  The\ndistrict court then stayed the execution and set an evidentiary\nhearing on Mr. Taylor’s claims for February 21, 2006.  The\ndistrict court’s stated reason for the stay was that it could not\naccommodate a hearing in Mr. Taylor’s case prior to February 21,\n2006 due to its full calendar.  See id. \nThe State of Missouri appealed the issuance of a stay, and\nthe Eighth Circuit vacated the stay and remanded to the district\ncourt on January 29, 2006 with instructions to assign a district\ncourt judge that could immediately hold a hearing and issue a\nruling prior to the scheduled February 1, 2006 execution.  See\nOrder, No. 06-1278. Eighth Cir. Jan. 29, 2006; see also Taylor v.\nCrawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097-98 (8th Cir. 2006).  \nOn remand, the district court judge immediately conducted a\nhearing on January 30 and 31, 2006, while making it clear the\n-22-\n\nhearing would be conducted in accord with the Eighth Circuit’s\ntimeline.  See id. at 1098.  Taylor was unable to conduct any\nfurther discovery and unable to procure the attendance of his\nwitnesses due to the untenable time constraints.  See id. \n“Taylor immediately appealed the district court’s adverse order,\nasserting that the expedited and truncated hearing before the\ndistrict court denied him due process. . .” Id.  Mr. Taylor also\nasserted error regarding his inability to call necessary\nwitnesses and the denial of his claims on the merits.  See id. \nHe also moved for a stay, which the panel denied.  See id.  The\nsame day an en banc panel granted Taylor’s request for a stay,\nhis motion for rehearing, and returned the case to the panel for\nbriefing and oral argument. See id.\nThe panel’s observation after briefing and oral argument is\nenlightening:\nHaving reviewed the record made before the\ndistrict court, we now realize the burdensome\nstrain that our order imposed upon the district\ncourt as well as upon the parties as they made\nextraordinary efforts to comply.  We hereby offer\nour mea culpa . . . We simply asked the district\ncourt and the parties to do too much in too little\ntime.  Id. at 1099.\nThe similarities between Mr. Hill’s case and the Taylor case\nare striking. Mr. Hill’s case was initially dismissed before the\ndistrict court the day after it was filed. On remand, after\npending seven months before the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, Mr. Hill was given less than twenty-four hours to file\n-23-\n\nhis pleadings, and he was denied discovery or any meaningful\nopportunity to pursue his claim. As in Taylor, too much was\ndemanded in too little time. The opportunities afforded Mr. Hill\nhere were even less than those afforded in Taylor.\nSimilarly, the case of Michael Morales is a case study in\nwhy a factual record must be fully developed to allow a court to\nproperly review an Eighth Amendment challenge to a state’s lethal\ninjection procedures.  See Morales v. Hickman, 2006 WL 335427\n(N.D. Cal., Feb. 14, 2006) reviewed at Morales v. Hickman, 2006\nWL 391604 (9th Cir., 2006).  The facts of Morales furnish a\npowerful example of why this Court should stay Mr. Hill’s\nexecution and afford him the opportunity to discover and present\nevidence challenging Florida’s lethal injection procedure. \nFlorida and California’s execution protocols are similar in that\nthey both use the same three chemicals and similar methods to\ndispense the chemicals.  Both employ machines to inject the\ndrugs, rather than utilize a traditional syringe, and the same\nthree drugs (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and\npotassium chloride) are utilized.  Morales’ challenge is\nessentially that some element or interaction of the elements of\nthe lethal injection procedure will result in him not being\nproperly anesthetized by the sodium thiopental and the injection\nof the other chemicals will subject him to torturous pain.4  \n4 As the Ninth Circuit observed: “There is no dispute that in the\nabsence of a properly administered anesthetic, Morales would\n-24-\n\nThe record developed in Mr. Morales’ case demonstrates that\nCalifornia’s lethal injection procedure created an unjustifiable\nlikelihood that he would endure excruciating pain if executed by\nlethal injection.  Morales also argued that there were recurrent,\ncritical problems with equipment and personnel used in the lethal\ninjection procedure.  The permitted factual development was\ncritical to Morales demonstrating that prison personnel were not\nproperly trained to insert intravenous lines and that the\nexecution team deviated from their protocol by administering\nmultiple doses of chemicals and the these irregularities were not\nreported in execution records. \nIn at least three of the executions reviewed in the Morales\nlitigation, intravenous line placement was a problem.  News\nreports detailed problems with the line placement during the\nexecution of Stanley “Tookie” Williams.  See Kevin Fagan, The\nExecution of Stanley “Tookie” Williams; Eyewitness: Prisoner Did\nNot Die Meekly, Quietly, S.F. CHRON., Dec. 14, 2005, at A12.  The\nfirst line was placed quickly, although it spurted blood, and\nthen the staff struggled to insert the second line.  The line\nplacement took long enough that “[b]y 12:10 a.m., the medical\ntech’s lips were tight and white and sweat was pooling on her\nforehead as she probed William’s arm.”  Id.  More importantly,\nexperience the sensation of suffocation as a result of the\npancuronium bromide and excruciating pain from the potassium\nchloride activating nerve endings in Morales’ veins.” Morales v.\nHickman, 2006 WL 391604 at *2. \n-25-\n\nthe execution log showed that one of the intravenous lines\nfailed.  This illustrative experience demonstrates that properly\ntrained and experienced personnel are critical for this difficult\nprocess.\nAs to the administration of multiple doses of potassium\nchloride, the district court in Morales cogently observed:\n  [E]vidence in the present record raises additional\nconcerns as to the manner in which the drugs used in\nthe lethal-injection protocol are administered.  For\nexample it is unclear why some inmates - including\nClarence Ray Allen, who had a long history of coronary\nartery disease and suffered a heart attack less than\nfive months before he was executed, ... – have required\nsecond doses of potassium chloride to stop promptly the\nbeating of their hearts.  Morales v. Hickman, 2006 WL\n335427 at *6(N.D. Cal., Feb. 14, 2006).\n \nMorales also received the detailed execution logs from\nseveral of the recent executions in the State of California.  See\nid.  The logs suggest that, contrary to the theoretical principle\nthat a high dose of sodium pentothal causes a condemned’s loss of\nconsciousness and respiration to cease within a minute, in many\nexecutions respiration and consciousness do not cease until\nseveral minutes after the administration of sodium pentothal. \nSee id. at 1044-1045.  In Morales, the district court noted the\nfollowing pertinent details about the execution logs:\n  Jaturun Siripongs, executed February 9, 1999:  The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:04 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:08 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:09\na.m., four minutes after the administration of sodium\nthiopental began and one minute after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began.\n-26-\n\n  Manuel Babbitt, executed May 4, 1999: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:28 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:31 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:33\na.m., five minutes after the administration of sodium\nthiopental began and two minutes after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began.  In\naddition, brief spasmodic movements were observed in\nthe upper chest at 12:32 a.m. \n \nDarrell Keith Rich, executed March 15, 2000: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:06 a.m.\nand the administration of pancuronium bromide began at\n12:08 a.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:08\na.m., when pancuronium bromide was injected, two\nminutes after the administration of sodium thiopental\nbegan.  Chest movements were observed from 12:09 a.m.\nto 12:10 a.m. \n \nStephen Wayne Anderson, executed January 29, 2002:\nThe administration of sodium thiopental began at 12:17\na.m. and the administration of pancuronium bromide\nbegan at 12:19 a.m., yet respirations did not cease\nuntil 12:22 a.m., five minutes after the administration\nof sodium thiopental began and three minutes after the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide began.\n \nStanley Tookie Williams, executed December 13,\n2005: The administration of sodium thiopental began at\n12:22 a.m., the administration of pancuronium bromide\nbegan at 12:28 a.m., and the administration of\npotassium chloride began at 12:32 a.m. or 12:34 a.m.,\nyet respirations did not cease until either 12:28 a.m.\nor 12:34 a.m. -- that is, either six or twelve minutes\nafter the administration of sodium thiopental began,\neither when or six minutes after the administration of\npancuronium bromide began, and either four minutes\nbefore or when the administration of potassium chloride\nbegan.\n \nClarence Ray Allen, executed January 17, 2006: The\nadministration of sodium thiopental began at 12:18\na.m., yet respirations did not cease until 12:27 a.m.,\nwhen pancuronium bromide was injected, nine minutes\nafter the administration of sodium thiopental began.\nMorales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp. 2d at 1044-1045 (footnotes\n-27-\n\nomitted). \nThe discovery and factual development in Morales was ample\nenough to render the district court capable of determining that\nCalifornia’s execution protocol was rife with grievous problems\nthat threatened to produce gratuitous, wanton, torturous pain\nunless the protocol was substantially modified.  The evidence\ndemonstrated a highly significant difference between the painless\nway the protocol was to work in theory and the torturous way it\nactually operated. Mr. Hill should have been permitted to engage\nin discovery and have his case proceed so that he could\ndemonstrate Florida’s lethal injection procedure is just as\nfraught with danger and constitutional infirmity as California’s.\nIndeed, following the evidence that surfaced after discovery\nwas disclosed about the recent executions in California, a\ndistrict court in Ohio granted a condemned inmate’s request for\npreliminary injunction based on a challenge to the chemicals and\nthe amount of chemicals used in the execution procedures in\nOhio.5  The district court stated: \n . . .this Court would be remiss if it did not take\nnote of the evidence that the district courts in\nMorales and Brown considered.  And that evidence raises\ngrave concerns about whether a condemned inmate would\nbe sufficiently anesthetized under Ohio’s lethal-\ninjection protocol prior to and while being executed,\nespecially considering that the dose of sodium\nthiopental prescribed under Ohio’s lethal-injection\n5 Ohio, like Florida, requires that only two (2) grams of sodium\npentothal be administered.  See Cooey v. Taft, et. al, 430 F.Supp\n2d 702 (2006); 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24496, 13. \n-28-\n\nprotocol (2 grams) is less than that prescribed under\nCalifornia’s protocol (5 grams) and that prescribed\nunder North Carolina’s protocol (3000 mg).” \nCooey v. Taft, et. al, 430 F.Supp 2d 702 (2006); 2006\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 24496, 13.  The district court referenced\nthe execution logs disclosed in Morales, as well as other\naffidavits and information. \nIn regards to the evidence submitted in Brown v. Beck, 2006\nU.S. Dist LEXIS 60084 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 7, 2006), affirmed, 445 F.3d\n752, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 9894 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. denied,\nstay denied, 126 S.Ct. 1836, 164 L.Ed.2d 566 (2006), the Cooey\nCourt also noted the autopsy results that showed the post-mortem\nlevels of sodium pentothal being less than what would be\nexpected. Id. at 11-12.  In Brown, evidence was submitted from\nwitnesses present at recent executions who had seen condemned\ninmates writhing and convulsing after the administration of the\nsodium pentothal, which was inconsistent with the notion that the\ninmates had lost consciousness. Brown at *16-18.  Thus, the\ninformation submitted in Brown v. Beck is entirely consistent and\nsupports the recent scientific research published in the Lancet\narticle.  \n  In issuing the preliminary injunction in Cooey, the district\ncourt found: “Given the evidence that has begun to emerge calling\nthis and other conclusions by Dr. Dershwitz into question, the\nCourt is persuaded that there is an unacceptable and unnecessary\n-29-\n\nrisk that Plaintiff Hill will be irreparably harmed absent the\ninjunction, i.e., that Plaintiff Hill could suffer unnecessary\nand excruciating pain while being executed in violation of his\nEighth Amendment right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual\npunishment.” Id. at 15.  Further, the District Court in Cooey\nfound that “[i]n view of the lack of development of the record in\nthis case, this Court does not feel that it is in a position to\navoid the issuance of a preliminary injunction by fashioning a\nremedy by which Ohio could carry out the execution of Plaintiff\nHill within the confines of the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 19.\nAs demonstrated above, since the United States Supreme Court\ngranted Mr. Hill a stay of execution and rendered its decision,\nnew, critical information has surfaced which undermines the\ntheories that originally supported the current lethal injection\nprotocols used in numerous states, including Florida.6  This new\ninformation demonstrates the flaws in Florida’s current lethal\n6 In addition to the recent developments mentioned above, on\nAugust 21, 2006, the Associated Press reported that in light of\ntestimony during a recent hearing on lethal injection in\nOklahoma, that state “has changed the way it administers fatal\ndrugs during executions.”  According to the article, Oklahoma\nchanged the way it had administered the fatal drugs in 2005, but\nwill now administer a double dose of the sedative, thiopental,\nbefore administering the sodium chloride to stop the heart. \nAdditionally, Oklahoma will also insert two intravenous lines so\nthat there is a back-up in case one of the lines fails.  \nIt is important to note that when Florida adopted lethal\ninjection as a method of execution, the protocol was modeled\nafter the protocol that was used in Oklahoma in 2000 – a protocol\nwhich has now been changed in order to reduce the chance that a\ncondemned inmate would not be sufficiently sedated.  \n-30-\n\ninjection protocols and supports Mr. Hill’s claim that under the\ncurrent Florida lethal injection protocol he will suffer\nunnecessary and excruciating pain while being executed in\nviolation of his Eighth Amendment right not to be subjected to\ncruel and unusual punishment.\nIII. TRUNCATED CONSIDERATION BY THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT\nPROVIDE MR. HILL DUE PROCESS IN LITIGATING HIS §1983 CLAIM.\nThe district court originally heard Mr. Hill’s § 1983 in\nJanuary 2006.  Mr. Hill filed his claim on Friday, January 20,\n2006, and the State of Florida filed their response the same day. \nThe next day, Saturday, January 21, 2006, the district court\ndismissed Mr. Hill’s claim, re-characterizing the claim as a\nsuccessive habeas petition and then dismissing under AEDPA.  \nSubsequently, this cause was remanded to the district court\npursuant to Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (June 12, 2006) and\nHill v. McDonough, No. 06-10621 (11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006), on\nThursday, August 31, 2006.  The CM/ECF notification of the remand\noccurred at 12:12 p.m. on that date.  The district court’s staff\ncontacted the office of undersigned counsel at approximately 1:45\np.m. to order that all pleadings in this matter be submitted by\nthe following day at noon.  Undersigned counsel was at the prison\nvisiting death row clients, including Mr. Hill, and returned\naround 5:00 p.m. to receive the district court’s order.  This\nallowed undersigned counsel a mere 19 hours, if he chose not to\nsleep, to comply with the district court’s request.  The parties\n-31-\n\ncomplied with the district court’s order and filed their\npleadings by noon on September 1, 2006.  In less than seven\nhours, the district court denied Mr. Hill’s request for a\npreliminary temporary injunction staying the execution – even\nthough the execution was still nineteen days away.  The district\ncourt’s consideration and rejection of Mr. Hill’s claims in such\na short time span is not the process which Mr. Hill is due.  \nThe guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life,\nliberty or property without due process of law is a fundamental\nconstitutional right that applies to both federal and state\ngovernmental actors through the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the U.S. Constitution.  The Due Process Clause applies to\nfederal courts, Dusenberry v. United States, 534 U.S. 161, 165\n(2002), and it applies in civil as well as criminal proceedings,\ne.g. Honda Motor Co. V. Oberg, 512 U.S. 415, 430-435 (1994).  It\nhas been long established that “[a]n elementary and fundamental\nrequirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be\naccorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the\ncircumstances, to apprise the interested parties of the pendency\nof the action and to afford them an opportunity” to present their\ncase.  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306,\n314 (1950). \nThe Supreme Court of the United States contemplated more\nwhen it held that district courts should decide the equities of a\n-32-\n\nstay in the first instance.  See Gomez, 503 U.S. 653, 112 S.Ct.\n1652, 118 L.Ed.2d 293 (1992)(per curiam); Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004); Hill v.\nMcDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (June 12, 2006).  In this case, the\nefficacy of a stay would have been more appropriately determined\nafter assessing the discovery requests submitted by Mr. Hill\nsubject to the expediting of the discovery process.  Instead, the\ndistrict court gave the parties less than twenty-four hours to\npresent their claims, and then rendered judgment on the pleadings\nwithout the benefit of discovery.  This truncated process was\nutilized even though nineteen days were left before Mr. Hill’s\nscheduled execution. \nThe nature of Mr. Hill’s case demands that he be granted a\nfull and fair evidentiary hearing both as to the efficacy of the\nstay and the merits of his claims.  An evidentiary hearing is\nnecessary to make certain that Mr. Hill will not be subjected to\nan unconstitutionally cruel punishment, as well as to ensure\npublic legitimacy as the State of Florida carries out his\nsentence.  The highly specific factual claims advanced by Mr.\nHill plainly cannot be properly litigated without a meaningful\nopportunity for discovery.  The district court’s order dismissing\nMr. Hill’s claims effectively prejudges Mr. Hill’s claims as\nfactually meritless.  That type of prejudging is highly improper\n-33-\n\nin any case, but is even more inappropriate in an Eighth\nAmendment challenge to a specific means of execution.\nIV. NO UNNECESSARY DELAY IN BRINGING MR. HILL’S CLAIM\nIn denying Mr. Hill relief, the district court found that\n“Moreover, Florida’s lethal injection methods were subjected to a\nfull evidentiary hearing in 2000 in Sims v. State, 754 So.2d 657\n(Fla. 2000), and Hill could have challenged the procedure after\nthe Sims decision was rendered.”  Order Dismissing Complaint, at\n7.  The district court continued, “Hill has offered no reason for\nhis delay in bringing a §1983 action until just days before his\nexecution.  Therefore, under the authority of Gomez, Nelson, and\nHill, this Court finds that Hill has delayed unnecessarily in\nbringing his §1983 challenge of Florida’s lethal injection\nprocedure, and his complaint must be dismissed.” Order Dismissing\nComplaint at 7-8 (citations omitted). \nThe district court’s analysis of Mr. Hill’s perceived delay\nin bringing his claim is erroneous and incomplete.  Mr. Hill did\nnot unduly delay in bringing his claim.  Rather, as is explained\nin his motion for temporary injunction before the district court,\nMr. Hill could not have brought his claim prior to the time his\nexecution date was set.   In support of this position, Mr. Hill\nstated as follows:\nE.  NO UNNECESSARY DELAY IN BRINGING MR.\nHILL’S CLAIM\n-34-\n\nMr. Hill diligently pursued his claim as\nsoon as it ripened.  His claim became ripe\nwhen his death warrant issued, because it was\nonly at that point that he could ascertain\nthe specific means by which the State would\ncarry out his lethal injection.  See\nWorthington v. Missouri, 166 S.W. 3d 566, 583\nn.3 (Mo. 2005).  That is so because the\nDepartment of Corrections retains complete\ndiscretion over how lethal injections will be\ncarried out, and shrouds its intentions in\nsecrecy.  \nNo Florida statute provides the chemical\nsequence to be used, the procedures for\nadministering it, any qualifications or\ntraining required for persons engaged in\nadministering the chemicals and monitoring\nthe execution, or the means of venous\naccess.7  Nor does any Florida statute even\nrequire that such procedures be devised\nthrough rule-making process, or in\nconsultation with medical experts.  Compare\nFla. Stat. §  828.055 (requiring Board of\nPharmacy to adopt rules for the issuance of\npermits authorizing the use of chemicals in\nanimal euthanasia, which “shall set forth\nguidelines for the proper storage and\nhandling” of the chemicals); 828.058\n(requiring training for animal euthanasia\ntechnicians involving a curriculum approved\nby the Board of Veterinary Medicine).  And\nthe Department has not itself decided to\npublish any definitive set of procedures\n7 In contrast, Florida prescribes, with careful detail, the\nchemicals to be used in animal euthanasia and the chemicals\nthat are prohibited for such use (including any neuromuscular\nblocking agent); a strict “order of preference” for the manner\nin  which  the  lethal  solution  is  to  be  administered;  the\nqualifications that a person administering the lethal solution\nmust possess; and a 16-hour “euthanasia technician course”\nthat anyone administering the lethal solution must have taken.\nSee Fla. Stat. 828.058.  The statute goes on to detail the\nminimum  topics  that  the  certification  course  must  cover\n(including pharmacology, proper administration and storage of\neuthanasia solutions) and the manner in which the curriculum\nfor the course is to be approved (by the Board of Veterinary\nMedicine).  See id. at 828.058(4)(a).  \n-35-\n\nthrough rule-making or otherwise.  The\nDepartment, therefore, retains total\ndiscretion to change the chemical sequence,\nthe manner of administration, the\nqualifications and training of the execution\nteam, and any safeguards to ensure proper\nadministration and adequate anesthetic depth\nat any time and with respect to any\nparticular execution. The State has never\ndisputed that the Department has total\ndiscretion in this regard. The “central\nconcern” of the ripeness doctrine “is whether\nthe case involves uncertain or contingent\nfuture events that may not occur as\nanticipated.”  Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n13A Federal Practice and Procedure § 3532, at\n112.  Accordingly, the ripeness inquiry looks\nto whether a sufficiently concrete and\ndefinitive agency policy or practice exists. \nOtherwise, judicial intervention would\n“den[y] the agency an opportunity to correct\nis own mistakes and to apply its expertise.” \nFederal Trade Comm’n v. Standard Oil Co., 449\nU.S. 232, 242 (1980).  As the Supreme Court\nof the United States has explained in the\nanalogous context of federal administrative\nreview, \n[T]he  ripeness  requirement  is  designed\n“to prevent the courts, through avoidance\nof  premature  adjudication,  from\nentangling  themselves  in  abstract\ndisagreements  over  administrative\npolicies,  and  also  to  protect  the\nagencies from judicial interference until\nan  administrative  decision  has  been\nformalized  and  its  effects  felt  in  a\nconcrete way by the challenging parties.”\nOhio Forestry Association, Inc. v. Sierra\nClub, 523 U.S. 726,\n732-33 (1983).     \nHere, rather than promulgate a definitive\npolicy, DOC has retained total discretion\nover its process of lethal injection.  For\nthis reason, it was only when Mr. Hill’s\nexecution was imminent that he could\nascertain what execution procedures would be\napplied to him.  The State cannot fight tooth\nand nail to resist publication of any\n-36-\n\ndefinitive protocol8, and then accuse the\ncondemned person of inequitable conduct\nbecause he must wait until his death warrant\nis issued to ascertain the particular\nprocedures that will be used in his\nexecution.  \nInstead, the State can secure an earlier\ndisposition of such suits simply by\nprescribing definitive practices or the\norderly adoption of rules, as it already has\ndone to regulate animal euthanasia.  The\nDepartment, moreover, need only implement the\nfamiliar process of agency rule-making to\nensure that the  question whether its chosen\nprocedures for administering lethal injection\nviolates the Eighth Amendment ripens before\nthe inmate’s date of execution is set.    \nGiven the lack of any constraints on the\nDepartment’s discretion and of any definitive\npractices that would have provided the courts\nwith a sufficiently concrete policy to\nreview, Mr. Hill’s claim did not ripen until\nthe execution warrant issued.  From the\nmoment that Mr. Hill’s challenge ripened, he\nhas diligently pursued his claim.  Mr. Hill\ninitially filed suit in state court, in order\nto defend against an argument that he had\nfailed to exhaust state remedies.9  As soon\n8 The State of Florida has denied Mr. Hill any access whatsoever\nto records, policies, procedures, or any other information\nconcerning its lethal injection protocols and procedures.\n9  Although  Mr.  Hill  was  not  required  to  exhaust  state-court\nremedies  prior  to  bringing  his  federal-court  action  under\n§ 1983,  see Wilkinson v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 1249 (2005),\nhe did so out of an abundance of caution, recognizing that if\nthe district court were to construe his complaint as a habeas\nfiling, he would have had to exhaust those judicial remedies,\nsee 48 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). The State of Florida raises the\nissue  of  the  PLRA  exhaustion  requirements  in  its  motion  to\ndismiss. Doc. 34, at 8-16. Notably, Mr. Hill’s complaint alleged\nthat no administrative remedies were available to him.  See\nComplaint at 17-18 and in his Amended Complaint.  The PLRA’s\nexhaustion requirement is not a rule of pleading the plaintiff\nmust satisfy.  It is an affirmative defense the defendant must\nplead  and  prove,  not  appropriate  for  consideration  under  a\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion where all facts must be construed\nin the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. See Anderson, 407\n-37-\n\nas his action was dismissed on procedural\ngrounds in state court, he filed his § 1983\naction.\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Temporary Injunction\nto Stay His Execution Scheduled for September\n20, 2006 at 6:00 p.m. at 28-31.\nThe above facts establish that Mr. Hill was diligent in\nfiling his §1983 claim.  Unfortunately, the district court’s\norder failed to acknowledge or specifically consider the facts\npresented.\nOf further note is that the study relied upon by Mr. Hill\nwas not published until April 2005, five years after the Sims\ndecision.  This study is new.  It is post-Sims.10  In addition,\nTaylor and Morales are recent decisions which demonstrate\nF.3d at 681; Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir.\n2003); Casanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 2002); Ray\nv. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 295 (3d Cir. 2002); Foulk v. Charrier,\n262 F.3d 687, 697 (8th Cir. 2001); Massey v. Helman, 196 F.3d\n727, 735 (7th Cir. 1999); Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 28-29\n(2d Cir. 1999); see also Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499\n(2005)  (assuming  that  the  PLRA’s  exhaustion  requirement  is\nwaivable); id. at 528 n.1 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (pointing out\nassumption); Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262, 267\n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (suggesting that exhaustion is an affirmative\ndefense).  Even  if  this  Court  construes  the  PLRA  exhaustion\nrequirement as a special matter that must be pled, Fed.R.Civ.P.\n9(c) allows Mr. Hill to plead generally that the condition was\nsatisfied and a denial of performance or occurrence must be\nspecifically pled with particularity.\n10 Mr. Hill’s claim is no different than in cases where new\nscientific DNA techniques were developed after those cases had\nconcluded.  Just as in those cases where courts are reconsidering\nprior rulings in light of subsequent scientific research, so\nshould Mr. Hill’s claim be considered in light of new scientific\nevidence.\n-38-\n\nexamples of how reality vastly differs from theory when grappling\nwith lethal injection issues.  The discovery in these cases\nexposed the Missouri and California procedures to be much more\ninadequate than ever imagined.  As none of this information was\navailable at the time Sims was decided, certainly Mr. Hill cannot\nbe faulted for failing to raise the issue.\n   Prior to Hill v. McDonough, this Court’s precedent refused\nto recognize and thereby notice condemned prisoners that a §1983\naction could be used to challenge “[m]ethod of execution” under\nthe Eighth Amendment.  In fact, this Circuit had consistently\nruled that Mr. Hill, and others on Florida’s death row, “could\n[not] have brought” the claim contained in the pending §1983\naction.  As well, this Court’s clear holding in Robinson v.\nCrosby, 358 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir. 2004), precluded such a\nlawsuit.  Indeed, the district court initially dismissed Mr.\nHill’s claim based upon that precedent, stating that there was no\nsubject matter jurisdiction for that court to consider the claim. \nIt was only on January 24, 2006 – when the United States Supreme\nCourt granted certiorari review in Hill v. Crosby to determine\nwhether this Court’s determination that district courts lack\njurisdiction to consider claims like Mr. Hill’s was correct –\nthat the validity of this precedent was called into question.\nThis Court’s precedent was succinctly explained in Hill v.\nCrosby:\n-39-\n\nIt is clear to us that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to consider appellant’s claim because it\nis the functional equivalent of a successive habeas\npetition and he failed to obtain leave of this court to\nfile it.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A).  And as the\npanel observed in Robinson, “such an application to\nfile a successive petition would be due to be denied in\nany event.  See In re Provanzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1235-\n36 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1256, 120\nS.Ct. 2710, 147 L.Ed.2d 979 (2000) (concluding that a\nclaim that lethal injection constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment does not meet the requirements of 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) or (B)).”\n437 F.3d 1084, 1085 (11th Cir. 2006)\nThus, unlike the situation in the bevy of circuit court\ncases cited by the District Court11, or even in Gomez v. U.S.\nDist. Ct. For N. Dist. Cal. 503 U.S. 653, 112 S.Ct. 1652, 118\nL.Ed.2d 293 (1992)(per curiam), there is “good reason” in this\ncase for the failure to present this claim previously.  According\nto the binding precedent of this Circuit when the Lancet study\ncame out in April of 2005, Mr. Hill could file neither a\nsuccessive habeas petition challenging the protocol employed by\nthe State of Florida for carrying out a lethal injection\nexecution, nor a §1983 complaint. \nFurther, in its consideration of the timeliness of Mr.\nHill’s action, the district court improperly conflated two key\nissues and the appropriate analysis for each: (1) the question of\n11 Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 2004); White v.\nJohnson, 429 F.3d 572, 574 (5th Cir. 2005); White v. Livingston,\n126 S.Ct. 601 (2005); Patton v. Jones, 2006 WL 2468312 (10th Cir.\nAug. 25, 2006); Reese v. Livingston, 453 F.3d 289, 291 (5th Cir.\nJune 20, 2006). \n-40-\n\ndismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); and (2) the question of\nwhether to temporarily enjoin (stay) Mr. Hill’s execution.  The\nState of Florida based their motion to dismiss upon Rule\n12(b)(6).  As this Court is well aware, Rule 12(b)(6) is an\nappropriate vehicle for dismissal only when the Plaintiff fails\nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Yet the\nentire procedural history of this case has been about whether Mr.\nHill has stated a viable claim under §1983.  See Hill v.\nMcDonough, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006);\nHill v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1084 (11th Cir. 2006).\nClearly, the United States Supreme Court found that Mr. Hill\nstated a viable claim, or it would not have remanded this cause.\nAll that is required from Mr. Hill at this juncture is a short,\nconcise statement of facts.  See Rule 8.  The Supreme Court\nspecifically held that there are no heightened pleading\nrequirements in Mr. Hill’s §1983 action.  See Hill at **53.  And\nthe Supreme Court clearly contemplated that ripeness was not a\nhindrance to Mr. Hill’s cause.  As Justice Breyer stated in his\nquestioning of the State of Florida during oral argument in this\ncause: \nAnd so [Mr. Hill] thinks, up until the last minute,\nthat maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold,\nwhen the death warrant is actually executed, it now\nbegins to appear that they won't.  And therefore, at\nthat time, he brings the case.  Now, I've spun out a\nstory which seems probable, that if it's true, it would\nbe very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the\nexecution warrant is issued and thereafter it is.\n-41-\n\nHill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44\n(2006), Oral Argument transcript at 29.\nMr. Hill’s complaint is timely as long as he files it within\nthe statute of limitations, so there is no dilatoriness or\nuntimeliness in the filing of the lawsuit.  As the district court\nstated in Cooey v. Taft, it is illogical to require a death-\nsentenced plaintiff to file a §1983 action any earlier than when\nhis execution is “imminent”:\n[Because] it appears that the [lethal injection]\nprotocol is subject to alteration until the time of\nexecution . . . requiring a death-sentenced plaintiff\nto file his method-of-execution challenge any sooner\n[than when his death is imminent] strikes this Court as\npotentially wasteful and possibly absurd, given the\npossibility that, prior to his execution becoming\nimminent, a plaintiff could see his conviction or death\nsentence reversed, or the alteration of the precise\nexecution protocol that plaintiff might seek to\nchallenge as unconstitutional. Cooey v. Taft, No. 2:04-\ncv-1156(Doc.14, at 11). \nThe timeliness issue is only relevant to the propriety of a\nstay under Gomez, Nelson, and Hill.  In terms of the viability of\nMr. Hill’s §1983 action, there is no question that Mr. Hill was\ndiligent, timely, and acting in accordance with established\nprecedent as he pursued this claim through the courts. \nTherefore, the District Court was clearly in error in dismissing\nMr. Hill’s claim on the basis of timeliness.\nMr. Hill diligently pursued his claim as soon as it ripened. \nHis claim became ripe when his death warrant issued, because it\nwas only at that point that he could ascertain the specific means\n-42-\n\nby which the State would carry out his lethal injection.  See\nWorthington v. Missouri, 166 S.W. 3d 566, 583 n.3 (Mo. 2005). \nThat is so because the Department of Corrections retains complete\ndiscretion over how lethal injections will be carried out, and\nshrouds its intentions in secrecy.  \nNo Florida statute provides the chemical sequence to be\nused, the procedures for administering it, any qualifications or\ntraining required for persons engaged in administering the\nchemicals and monitoring the execution, or the means of venous\naccess.12  Nor does any Florida statute even require that such\nprocedures be devised through rule-making process, or in\nconsultation with medical experts.  Compare Fla. Stat. § 828.055\n(requiring Board of Pharmacy to adopt rules for the issuance of\npermits authorizing the use of chemicals in animal euthanasia,\nwhich “shall set forth guidelines for the proper storage and\nhandling” of the chemicals); 828.058 (requiring training for\nanimal euthanasia technicians involving a curriculum approved by\n12 In contrast, Florida prescribes, with careful detail, the\nchemicals to be used in animal euthanasia and the chemicals\nthat are prohibited for such use (including any neuromuscular\nblocking agent); a strict “order of preference” for the manner\nin  which  the  lethal  solution  is  to  be  administered;  the\nqualifications that a person administering the lethal solution\nmust possess; and a 16-hour “euthanasia technician course”\nthat anyone administering the lethal solution must have taken.\nSee Fla. Stat. 828.058.  The statute goes on to detail the\nminimum  topics  that  the  certification  course  must  cover\n(including pharmacology, proper administration and storage of\neuthanasia solutions) and the manner in which the curriculum\nfor the course is to be approved (by the Board of Veterinary\nMedicine).  See id. at 828.058(4)(a).  \n-43-\n\nthe Board of Veterinary Medicine).  And the Department has not\nitself decided to publish any definitive set of procedures\nthrough rule-making or otherwise.  The Department, therefore,\nretains total discretion to change the chemical sequence, the\nmanner of administration, the qualifications and training of the\nexecution team, and any safeguards to ensure proper\nadministration and adequate anesthetic depth at any time and with\nrespect to any particular execution.  The State has never\ndisputed that the Department has total discretion in this regard.\nThe “central concern” of the ripeness doctrine “is whether\nthe case involves uncertain or contingent future events that may\nnot occur as anticipated.”  Charles Alan Wright et al., 13A\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 3532, at 112.  Accordingly, the\nripeness inquiry looks to whether a sufficiently concrete and\ndefinitive agency policy or practice exists.  Otherwise, judicial\nintervention would “den[y] the agency an opportunity to correct\nis own mistakes and to apply its expertise.”  Federal Trade\nComm’n v. Standard Oil Co., 449 U.S. 232, 242 (1980).  As the\nSupreme Court of the United States has explained in the analogous\ncontext of federal administrative review, \n[T]he ripeness requirement is designed “to prevent\nthe courts, through avoidance of premature\nadjudication, from entangling themselves in\nabstract disagreements over administrative\npolicies, and also to protect the agencies from\njudicial interference until an administrative\ndecision has been formalized and its effects felt\nin a concrete way by the challenging parties.”\n-44-\n\nOhio Forestry Association, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726,\n732-33 (1983). \n    \nHere, rather than promulgate a definitive policy, DOC has\nretained total discretion over its process of lethal injection. \nFor this reason, it was only when Mr. Hill’s execution was\nimminent that he could ascertain what execution procedures would\nbe applied to him.  The State cannot fight tooth and nail to\nresist publication of any definitive protocol13, and then accuse\nthe condemned person of inequitable conduct because he must wait\nuntil his death warrant is issued to ascertain the particular\nprocedures that will be used in his execution.  \nInstead, the State can secure an earlier disposition of such\nsuits simply by prescribing definitive practices or the orderly\nadoption of rules, as it already has done to regulate animal\neuthanasia.  The Department, moreover, need only implement the\nfamiliar process of agency rule-making to ensure that the \nquestion whether its chosen procedures for administering lethal\ninjection violates the Eighth Amendment ripens before the\ninmate’s date of execution is set.    \nGiven the lack of any constraints on the Department’s\ndiscretion and of any definitive practices that would have\nprovided the courts with a sufficiently concrete policy to\n13 The State of Florida has denied Mr. Hill any access whatsoever\nto records, policies, procedures, or any other information\nconcerning its lethal injection protocols and procedures.\n-45-\n\nreview, Mr. Hill’s claim did not ripen until the execution\nwarrant issued.  From the moment that Mr. Hill’s challenge\nripened, he has diligently pursued his claim.  Mr. Hill initially\nfiled suit in state court, in order to defend against an argument\nthat he had failed to exhaust state remedies.14  As soon as his\naction was dismissed on procedural grounds in state court, he\nfiled his § 1983 action. \nV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hill respectfully requests\nthat this Court grant his Application For a Stay of Execution and\nfor Expedited Appeal.\nRespectfully submitted,\n                                     \nD.

TODD DOSS\nFlorida Bar No. 0910384\n725 Southeast Baya Drive\nSuite 102\nLake City, FL 32025-6092\nTelephone (386) 755-9119\nCOUNSEL FOR PETITIONER\n\nREQUEST FOR STAY OF EXECUTION\nPetitioner, Clarence Edward Hill, applies to this Court\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(f) for a stay of his execution,\ncurrently scheduled for September 20, 2006 at 6:00 p.m., and\nstates as follows:  \n1. On September 1, 2006, Mr. Hill filed an amended\ncomplaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States\nDistrict Court, Northern District of Florida, Tallahassee\nDivision.  Mr. Hill alleged violations of his right to be free\nfrom cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  On that same date,\nthe district court denied Mr. Hill’s complaint for declaratory\nand injunctive.  Thereafter, the district court denied Mr. Hill’s\nmotion for reconsideration on September 11, 2006.  \n2. On September 13, 2006, Mr. Hill filed a Notice of\nAppeal.  On that same date, Mr. Hill filed in the Eleventh\nCircuit an Application for a Stay of Execution and for Expedited\nAppeal, which was denied on September 15, 2006.\n3. Mr. Hill seeks an Order from this Court for a stay of\nexecution pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(f), which provides in\npart:\nIn any case in which the final judgment or decree of\nany court is subject to review by the Supreme Court on\nwrit of certiorari, the execution and enforcement of\nsuch judgment or decree may be stayed for a reasonable\ntime to enable the party aggrieved to obtain a writ of\ncertiorari from the Supreme Court.  \n-1-\n\n4. Mr. Hill asks this Court to stay his presently\nscheduled execution to allow the Court adequate time to consider\nthe Petition.\n5. This Court's authority to enter a stay of execution has\nbeen analyzed by this Court as involving the following four-part\ntest:\nwhether the movant has made a showing of\nlikelihood of success on the merits and of\nirreparable injury if the stay is not\ngranted; whether the stay would substantially\nharm other parties, and whether granting the\nstay would serve the public interest. Bundy\nv. Wainwright, 808 F.2d 1410, 1421 (11th Cir.\n1987). See also, Barefoot v. Estelle, 463\nU.S. 880 (1983) \n6. Mr. Hill has met the standards attendant to the\ngranting of a stay of his execution.  Each of the criteria is\nsatisfied in this case.\nA. IRREPARABLE INJURY\n7. If the requested stay is not issued, Mr. Hill will be\nexecuted at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, September 20, 2006.  This\nexecution will carry an unacceptably high risk of being conducted\nin a torturous manner in violation of Mr. Hill’s Eighth Amendment\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  This\nconstitutes irreparable injury.  See, e.q., Evans v. Bennett, 440\nU.S. 1301, 1306 (1979) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice, granting a\nstay of execution and noting the “obviously irreversible nature\nof the death penalty”); O’Bryan v. Estelle, 691 F.2d 706, 708\n-2-\n\n(5th Cir. 1982) (the “irreversible nature of the death penalty”\nconstitutes irreparable injury and weighs heavily in favor of\ngranting a stay); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir.\n1996) (holding that continued pain and suffering resulting from\ndeliberate medical indifference is irreparable harm). \nAdditionally, the State’s violation of Mr. Hill’s Eighth\nAmendment rights alone validates a presumption of irreparable\nharm.  See Associated General Contractor’s of California, Inc. v.\nCoalition for Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1412 (9th Cir.\n1991) (an alleged constitutional infringement will often alone\nconstitute irreparable harm).\nB. HARM TO OTHER PARTIES\n8. There will be no harm to other parties if a stay of\nexecution is granted.  Mr. Hill will remain in custody at Florida\nState Prison, where he has been held since his conviction and,\nmost recently, since the stay of execution was entered by the\nSupreme Court of the United States on January 25, 2006.  A\nrelatively brief continuation of the status quo will cause\nabsolutely no harm to other parties.  See Gomez v. U.S. Dist. Ct.\nFor Northern Dist. Of Cal., 966 F.2d 460, 462 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(Noonan, J., dissenting from grant of writ of mandate) (“The\nstate will get its man in the end.  In contrast, if persons are\nput to death in a manner that is determined to be cruel, they\nsuffer injury that can never be undone, and the Constitution\n-3-\n\nsuffers an injury that can never be repaired.”)\nC. PUBLIC INTEREST\n9. Although there are competing public interests,\nultimately one factor favors the issuance of the temporary relief\nsought.  Certainly, the public has an interest in the execution\nof Mr. Hill pursuant to the judgment of the Florida Courts.  More\nimportantly, however, it has an interest in determining that Mr.\nHill’s execution will be carried out consistent the with\nrequirements of the Eighth Amendment.  Additionally, the State\nhas an interest in not subjecting Mr. Hill to the excruciating\nand torturous pain likely involved in the lethal injection\nprocess Florida intends upon utilizing.  See Sims v. State, 754\nSo.2d 657 (Fla. 2000).  It is therefore paramount that Mr. Hill’s\nweighty constitutional claims be resolved on the merits.  \n10. Further, as set forth in his petition, by arbitrarily\nsetting an execution date while this case was awaiting remand,\nthe State has attempted to manipulate the process and deny Mr.\nHill his right to have this unconstitutional method of execution\nreviewed on the merits.  Certainly, it is in the public interest\nnot to permit the State to deprive Mr. Hill of his right to\npursue his claims, and thereby achieve its ultimate goal – to\nprevent Florida’s lethal injection procedure from being subjected\nto any meaningful scrutiny.\n-4-\n\nD. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MR. HILL WILL PREVAIL ON THE MERITS\n11. The likelihood that Mr. Hill will prevail on the merits\nof his claims is demonstrated by the discussion presented in\ndetail in his Petition, which examines recent developments in\nsimilarly situated cases where the merits have actually been\nexamined.  Given the success in those cases, a stay of execution\nand full and fair review are appropriate here.\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the\nforegoing has been furnished to Carolyn Snurkowski, Assistant\nAttorney General, Office of the Attorney General, Plaza Level 1,\nThe Capitol, Tallahassee, FL 32399, this 18th day of September\n2006.\n /s/ D.

NJADPu rges  this  \"Court  to\nreverse the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Eleventh Circuit in favor of Respondents.\nIn particular,  NJADrPe spectfully  submits this  brief\nin support of  Petitioner  Clarence EdwardH  ill,  whob rought\nthis  action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking declaratory  and\ninjunctive relief  because Florida’s lethal  injection  protocol\nresults  in  an unreasonable  risk  of  unnecessary  pain  and\nsuffering,  and,  as  such,  constitutes  cruel  and unusual\npunishment  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  and Fourteenth\nAmendmentst o  the  United  States  Constitution.  Amicus\ncuriae submits that States  should be required to account for\ntheir  lethal  injection protocols and procedures and that  such\nprotocols  and procedures  should  be based upon reasoned\nmedical  opinion  and sound  scientific  evidence.  Only\nthrough the  adoption of reasoned protocols  and procedures\ncan States insure that  the administration of lethal  injection\nwill not result  in the significant  likelihood  of unnecessary\npain and suffering.\nSUMMARY OF  THE  ARGUMENT\nThe question before this  Court is  whether a challenge\nto a specific lethal  injection protocol is cognizable under 42\nU.S.C.  § 1983.  Are such  claims  \"properly  viewed  as\nchallenges to the  conditions of  a condemnedin mate’s death\nsentence,\" or do they fall  \"within the core of federal habeas\n\ncorpus?\" See United States  v.  Ne&on,5 41 U.S. 637, 643-44\n(2004).  Such challenges to  a lethal  injection  protocol  are\ncognizable  under Section  1983 and do not fall  within  the\ncore of federal habeas corpus.\nFirst,  a challenge  to  a specific  lethal  injection\nprotocol  is  cognizable  under Section  1983.  The Eighth\nAmendmentb ars  the  unnecessary  infliction  of  pain  and\nsuffering. Petitioner alleges that,  as it  is administered, there\nis  a significant  likelihood  that  Florida’s  lethal  injection\nprotocol  will  result  in unnecessary pain and suffering.  In\norder to avoid this  significant  likelihood,  a State’s  lethal\ninjection  protocols  and procedures  must be based  upon\nreasoned  medical  opinion  and evidence.  In  most States,\nincluding  Florida,  such protocols  and procedures are  not\nbased  upon reasoned  medical  opinion  and evidence.  As\nsuch,  most States  tail  to insure  that  lethal  injection  is\nproperly administered, resulting in a significant  likelihood of\nunnecessary pain and suffering.  Hence, Petitioner  presents a\ncognizable claim under Section 1983.\nSecond, a challenge  to  a specific  lethal  injection\nprotocol does not imply the invalidity  of the conviction or\ndeath sentence,  and hence does not fall  within the core of\nhabeas  corpus.  Rather,  such  a  claim  challenges  the\nconditions under which the inmate will  be executed, not the\nfact  of the execution itself:  BecauseS tates are free to adopt\nreasonable,  constitutional  altenlatives  to the  challenged\nprotocol,  a challenge to a lethal  injection  protocol,  even if\nsuccessful,  will  not imply the invalidity  of  the underlying\nconviction and sentence.\nThus, Petitioner  Hill’s  claim regarding  Florida’s\nspecific lethal  injection  protocols was appropriately brought\nunder Section 1983. As such,  this  Court should reverse  the\nruling of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n3\nARGUMENT\nPETITIONER’S  CLAIM  DOES  NOT\nSOUND  IN  HABEAS  CORPUS,  BUT\nRATHER  STATES  A  COGNIZABLE\nCLAIM UNDER SECTION 1983.\nA. A Challenge  To A Particular  Lethal\nInjection  Protocol  Is  Cognizable  Under\nSection 1983.\nSection 1983 authorizes  a \"suit  in equity,  or other\nproper  proceeding  for  redress\"  against  any person  who,\nunder color of state  law, \"subjects, or causes to be subjected,\nany citizen  of the United States  to  the deprivation  of any\nrights,  privileges,  or  immunities  secured  by  the\nConstitution.\"  42 U.S.C. § 1983. Petitioner’s  complaint\nstates  such a claim. He alleges  that  the  State of  Florida,\nunder color of state  law, will subject him to a deprivation of\na right  secured by the Constitution,  namelyt he right  to be\nfree  from cruel  and unusual punishmentu nder the Eighth and\nFourteenth  Amendments.S ee U.S.  Const.  amends VIII  and\nXIV.\nThe Eighth  Amendmentp rohibits  the  \"unnecessary\nand wanton infliction  of pain.\"  Gregg v.  Georgia, 428 U.S.\n153, 173 (1976).  Punishmentsa re considered unnecessary \nwanton when they  are  either  \"barbaric\"  or  \"excessive  in\nrelation  to  the  crime committed.\" Coker v.  Geol~ia, 433\nU.S.  584,  592 (1977).  A punishment is  excessive  if \n\"makes no measurable contribution  to  acceptable  goals  of\npunishmenta nd hence is  nothing other  than the purposeless\nand needless imposition of  pain and suffering.\"  Id.  at  592.\nIndeed, this  Court has long held that  the Eighth Amendment\nprotects  prisoners  from the  \"gratuitous  infliction  of\nsuffering.\"  Gregg, 428 U.S. at  183 (citing  Wilkerson v.\n\n4\nUtah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-36 (I  878) and In  re Kemmler, 136\nU.S. 436, 447 (1890)). Here, Petitioner  claims that  Florida’s\nlethal  injection  protocol will  result  in the unnecessary and\nwanton infliction  of  pain.  He alleges  that  there  is  a\nsignificant  likelihood  that  the  improper administration  of\nanesthesia  will  result  in  a torturous  death,  which would\nconstitute  \"the purposeless and needless imposition of pain\nand suffering.\"  Coker, 433 U.S. at  592. Thus, Petitioner\nstates  a cognizable claim under Section 1983.\nFlorida,  like  a majority of States,  employsa  three-\ndrug protocol for carrying out executions by lethal  injection.\nSee Sims v.  State,  754 So. 2d 657, 666 n. 17 (Fla.  2000). The\nprotocol contemplates that  a succession of three  drugs will\nbe administered  intravenously  to  the  death-sentenced\nprisoner.  See id.  at 687. The first  drug --  administered in a\nnonlethal  dose --  is  an \"ultra-short  acting  barbiturate,\"\ntypically  sodium thiopental,  the  function  of  which is  to\ninduce  a loss  of  consciousness;  the  second is  a neuro-\nmuscular blocking  agent,  typically  pancuronium.bromide,\nwhich is  a muscle relaxant  and paralyzes the  diaphragma nd\nthe lungs; and the third  is  potassiumc hloride,  whichi nduces\ncardiac  arrest.  See id.;  Report of Mark Heath, M.D., dated\nFebruary 13, 2004, at  ¶1¶1 7, 10, 14 (proposed to be lodged,\npursuant to Rule 32.3, with the Clerk of the  United States\nSupreme Court;  also  on file  with  counsel); ~ Deborah W.\nDenno, When Legislatures  Delegate Death.

See  Heath\nReport,  at  ¶ 5.  Without appropriate  anesthesia,  an affected\nprisoner  will  suffer  excruciating  pain  when the  two other\ndrugs  that  make up the  protocol  are  administered.  See id.\nThe neuromuscular  blocking  agent,  which has  no anesthetic\nproperties,  will  completely  paralyze  the  inmate,  but  leave\nhim conscious  and awake as  he suffbcates.  See id.  at  ¶ 10;\nDenno, supra,  at  109 n.  321 (noting  that  if  the  short-acting\nbarbiturate  wears off,  \"’the  prisoner  will  suffer  an extremely\npainful  sensation  of  crushing  and  suffocation,  as  the\npancuronium bromide takes  effect  and stops  his  ability  to\nbreath’\"  (quoting  Affidavit  of  Edward A. Brunner,  M.D.,\nPh.D.,  Exhibit  B of  Verified  Complaint in  Chancery, Gacy v.\nPeters,  N’o.  94 CH (Ill.  Apr.  1994));  see  also  Chanev v.\nHeckler,  718 F.2d  1174,  !191  (D.C.Cir.  1983),  rev’d  on\nother  grounds,  470 U.S. 821 (1985)  (\"Indeed,  even a slight\nerror  in  dosage  or  administration  can  leave  a  prisoner\nconscious  but  paralyzed  while  dying,  a  sentient  witness  of\nhis  or  her  own slow,  lingering  asphyxiation.\").  And the\npotassium  chloride  will  cause  an \"excruciating  searing  or\nburning  sensation  that  is  likened  to  that  of  boiling  oil  or\nbranding  with  a  hot  iron.\"  See  H3eath  Report,  at  ¶  15.\nThus, if  the dosage of sodium thiopental  is  too low or if  it  is\nimproperly  administered,  the  inmate  \"will  regain\nconsciousness  only  to  find  himself  paralyzed  by  the\npancuronium and then  experiencing  the  agony of  intravenous\nconcentrated  potassium injection.\"  See Heath Report, at  ¶1 7.\nSee Dennos, upra, at 90-94. Thus, there are 36 states thai authorize the\nuse lethal injection as a methodo f execution.\n3 Notably, \"[t]here  are manyp ossible alternative  drugs or chemical\nagenlst hat are equallye ffective in causinga nd maintainincga rdiac arrest\nbut do not causep ain.\" HeathR eport,a t ¶] 18.\n\n6\nIn light  of  the potential  tbr  excruciating  pain  in the\nadministration  of the  three-drug  protocol,  States  must insure\nthat  their  protocols  and procedures for  administering  lethal\ninjection  are  adopted  on the  basis  of  medical  expertise\nregarding  the  proper  administration  of  anesthesia.  Where\nsuch protocols  are,  to  the contrary,  based upon an utter  lack\nof expert  opinion and scientific  evidence,  they are arbitrary\nand cannot be justified  in light  of  the proscription  on cruel\nand unusual  punishment.  See Overton  v.  Bazzetta,  539 U.S.\n126,  136-37  (2003).  Thus,  in  2001,  the  New Jersey\nDepartment  of  Corrections  (NJDOC) proposed  to  readopt\nand amend the  regulations  setting  tbrtb  NewJ ersey’s  lethal\ninjection  protocol.  See 33 N.J.R.  2991(a)  (Sept.  4,  2001).\nNJADPb rought  an action  challenging  these  regulations  on\nstate  and  federal  constitutional  and  administrative-law\ngrounds, alleging,  inter  alia,  that  the regulations  violated  the\nproscription  on cruel  and unusual  punishment and that  they\nlacked  an  appropriate  administrative  record.  See  In  re\nReadoption  With  Amendments of  Death Penalty  Regtdations,\n367 N.J.  Super.  61 (App. Div. 2004),  cert.  denied  182 N.J.\n149 (2004).  In that  action,  the court held that  several  of New\nJersey’s  lethal  injection  regulations  lacked  an adequate\nadministrative  record  that  would demonstrate  that  they  were\nbased  upon \"reasoned  medical  opinion.\"  In  re  Readoption,\n367 N.J.  Super. at  69.  The court  stated  that  its  concern was\n\"that  DOCi tself  does  not  have  medical  expertise,  and\nnothing  \"in  the  record  suggests  medical  consultation  and\nopinion.\"  See id.  at  69.  Without  such a  record  of  medical\nconsultation  and  opinion,  the  court  found,  NJDOCw  as\nunable to  show that  the  regulations  at  issue  comported with\n\"contemporary  standards  of  decency  and  morality,\"  and\nhence were not  violative  of  the  proscription  on cruel  and\nunusual  punishment.  See id. 4 The court  theret-bre  remanded\na In considering  whether a punishment is  \"cruel  and unusual,\"  this  Court\nconsiders  society’s  \"’evolving  slandards  of  decency  thai  mark Ihe\n\n7\nthe  matter  to  NJDOCfo r  \"further  consideration\"  and the\nopportunity  to  articulate  \"a supporting  basis  for  those\ndeterminations.\"  See id.  at  68. Without such a basis,  the\nregulations  could not be implementedw  ithout running afoul\nof the proscription on cruel and unusual punishment.\nSuch principles  apply here as well.  States  must base\ntheir  protocols  on reasoned  medical opinion  in  order  to\ninsure  that  lethal  injection  does not constitute  cruel  and\nunusual punishmentt hrough the arbitrary  infliction  of pain\nand suffering.  Yet, Florida,  and other States,  have failed  to\nbase their  lethal  injection  protocols  on reasoned medical\nopinion and scientific  evidence.  The three-drug  protocol,\nnoww  idely in use in Florida and numerouso ther States,  was\nnot adopted oil  the basis of such \"reasoned medical opinion.\"\nId. at 69. In fact,  the three-drug protocol wasf irst  adoptedi n\nOklahomai n  1977, based upon tile  informal  advice of  one\nphysician.  See  Don Colburn,  Oklahoma Was the  First,\nWASHP. OST,D  ec. l  1,  1990, at  14. That advice was in the\nform of  a short  letter  to  a state  senator  by Dr. Stanley\nDeutsch,  who was then  the  head  of  Oklahoma Medical\nSchool’s Anesthesiology Department. See Denno, sltpt’~l,  at\n95. Dr. Deutschs uggested that lethal  injection be carried out\nthrough the  administration  of  an \"’ultra  shorting  acting\nbarbiturate\"  and a \"neuromuscularb locking drug.\" See id.  at\n95 n.207 (reprinting  Dr. Deutsch’s letter).  In  response,\nOklahomas tatutorily  adopted a protocol  which accepted,\nnearly  verbatim,  the  terminology  in  his  letter.  Compare\nOkla. Star.  Ann. tit.  22, § 1014(A)w  ith Denno,s upra, at  95-\n96 n. 207. Other States  followed Oklahomaw ithout further\nscientific  inquiry.  See Denno, supra,  at  97-98;  see also\nStephen  Trombley,  THE  EXECUTION PROTOCOL:  INSIDE\nAMERICA’S CAPITAL PUNISHMENTI NDUSTRY 70-75  (1992).\nIt  is  unclear whyp otassium chloride was subsequently added\nprogress of a mature society.’\"  Atki~ts v.  Georgia, 536 U.S. 304,311-12\n(2002) (quoting Trop v.  Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-01 (1958)).\n\nto tile  standard protocol,  but there is  reason to believe that  it\nwas at  the  suggestion  of  Fred  Leuchter,  who was neither  a\ndoctor  nor  a  scientist,  but  an  individual  who invented\nexecution  devices  which  he  sold  to  States  around  the\ncountry.  See  Trombley,  sttp#~l,  at  76-77.  According  to\nLeuchter,  because there  was no medical literature  specifying\nthe  dosages  of  drugs  that  would be lethal,  he relied  on\ninformation  that  was available  tbr  pigs  and  estimated\naccordingly.  See id.  at  77-78.  Leuchter  later  conceded that\nthe  infornlation  available  was based upon a lethal  injection\nthat  was carried  out on only one pig.  See id.\nMoreover,  Florida’s  lethal  injection  protocol  and\nprocedures  do not  even  purport  to  be  premised  on such  a\nreasoned  basis,  as  they  are  created  by Florida’s  Department\nof  Corrections  (FLDOC)w  ithout  public  scrutiny  or  formal\nrulemaking.  In  tacL Florida’s  lethal  injection  statute  does\nnot limit  FLDOC’ds iscretion  in  any way; nor does it  require\nFLDOCto   prolnulgate  regulations  implementing  its  lethal\ninjection  procedures.  See Fla.  Stat.  § 922.105(5) (providing\nthat  a \"death sentence  shall  be executed by lethal  injection,\nunless  the person sentenced to  death  affirmatively  elects  to\nbe  executed  by  electrocution\").  Thus,  there  are  no\nsubstantive  or  procedural  reins  upon the  FLDOC’sd iscretion\nto  adopt,  modify, or  deviate  from any particular  protocols  or\nprocedures.  Indeed,  Florida’s  lethal  injection  protocols  are\nnot  even publicly  available.  And, they can be changed at  any\nmoment, tip  until  the  eve of  execution. 5 Thus, FLDOCis   not\nrequired  to  justify  any of  its  lethal  injection  procedures in\nlight  of reasoned opinion.\nit  is  evident that  such protocols  --  adopted without a\nbasis  in expert opinion and evidence --  are arbitrary  and lack\nIn many stales,  protocols  are not publicly  awlilable.  See Denno, stq~#’a,\nal  116-17.  In  some slates,  the  protocols  are  confidential  or  simply\nnonexislenl.  See id.  al I 17.\n\na reasonable medical basis.  In specific,  most State protocols\nentirely  fail,  in certain  key respects,  to insure the proper\nadministration of lethal injection in light of the potential fbr\nexcruciating pain in the absence of appropriate anesthesia.\nFirst,  lethal  injection  is  most often carried  out by\nindividuals  whoh ave little  or no expertise or training.  See\nHerb Haines,  PrimumN  on Nocere: Chemical Execution  and\nthe  Limits of  Medical Social  Control,  36 Soc. PROBS4. 42,\n445-46 (1989); Harold L. Hirsh, Physicians as Executioners,\nLEGALA SPECTOS FM  ED.P RAC.1 , 102 (Mar. 1984).  In  fact,\nmost state  protocols, including Florida’s,  do not  specify who\nthe  executioners will  be or what type of training  they must\nhave in  order  to  administer  lethal  injection.  See Denno,\nst.tpra, at 121-22.\nHowever, unless  anesthesia  is  administered  and\nmonitoredb y individuals with adequate training,  there can be\nno assurance  that  it  will  take  effect  and be adequately\nmaintained.

See id.\n\n!i\ndoing so,  it  is  impossible to ascertain  whether or  not the\ninmate undergoingl ethal  execution is  properly anesthetized.\nNor do States  require,  for  example,  that  the  dosages\nadministered  account  tbr  each  prisoner’s  physical\ncharacteristics,  assuring  that  the  prisoner  will  remain\nanesthetized during the course of  his execution. See Finks,\nsupra, at  397 (noting that  \"(a)ge,  sex,  and body weight \ncontribute to the individual’s response to the drug[s]\" used in\nlethal  injection);  Denno, supra, at  117-19. Somep risoners\nmay need a higher dosage of thiopental  than others  \"before\nlosing  consciousness and sensation.\"  See Denno, supra, at\n353. Thus, the failure  to  specify the  appropriate  dosages,\nincluding taking into account the individual characteristics  of\nthe person to be executed, in addition to tile  lack of adequate\ntraining  required  of  the  executioners,  results-in  the\nsignificant  likelihood of impropera dministration of the death\npenalty and unnecessary pain and suffering.\nIn  sum, lethal  injection  protocols  and procedures\nwhich do not prescribe  the  appropriate  dosages in  order to\ninsure proper anesthesia, and whichf ail  to provide that lethal\ninjection be carried out by adequately trained individuals, are\nnot  based upon reasoned  medical  opinion  and scientific\nevidence and will  result  in a substantial  likelihood  of  an\ninhumanea nd torturous death by lethal  injection.  Thus, such\nprotocols  do not  accord  with  contemporary standards  of\nmorality  and decency and instead  constitute  cruel  and\nunusual punishment. Because the  significant  likelihood  of\nan inhumanea nd tortuous  death  would constitute  cruel  and\nunusual punishment, Petitioner  states  a cognizable  claim\nunder Section 1983.\n\n12\ngo A  Challenge  To A Particular  Lethal\nInjection  Protocol Does  Not  Imply  The\nInvalidity  Of  The Conviction  Or Death\nSentence.\nHowever,  even  if  Petitioner  states  a  cognizable\nSection 1983 claim,  this  claim will  yield  to  the more specific\nfederal  habeas corpus statute,  see  28 U.S.C. § 2254, with its\nattendant  procedural  and exhaustion  requirements,  see  28\nU.S.C § 2244, if  he seeks  injunctive  relief  challenging  the\nfact  of  his  conviction  or  the  duration  of  his  sentence.  See\nPreiser  v.  RodriL,  uez,  411 U.S. 475, 489 (1973).  Ira  claim\nfalls  within the \"core\" of habeas corpus, that  is,  if  it  amounts\nto  a challenge to the fact  or duration of a sentence,  it  is  not\ncognizable  when brought  pursuant  to  Section  1983.  See id.\nThe question  is  whether a  judgment in  favor  the  plaintiff\n\"would necessarily  imply the  invalidity  of his  conviction  or\nsentence.\"  Heck v.  Hmlq~hr~;v, 512 U.S. 477,487 (1994).\nPetitioner  Hill  seeks a permanent injunction  that  will\nbar  the  state  from  executing  him  \"in  the  manner  they\ncun’ently  intend.\"  Compl., at  ¶j¶[  19-20.  He does  not  seek\nrelief  from judgrnent,  execution  or  even death  by lethal\ninjection.  Rather, his claim alleges  that  the adrninistration  of\nFlorida’s  lethal  injection  protocol will  result  in a significant\nlikelihood  of  unnecessary  pain  and suffering.  Even if  his\nclaim is successfid,  the State is  tree  to adopt constitutionally\nacceptable  alternatives  to  the current  protocol,  alternatives\nthat  are based upon medical expertise  and scientific  evidence\nand which will  not  result  in  a significant  likelihood  of\nunnecessary pain  and suffering.  Thus, Petitioner’s  challenge\nis  not equivalent  to  a challenge  to  the underlying conviction\nor  sentence.  See  NeLson,  541  U.S.  at  644  (noting  that\n\"simply by altering  its  method of  execution,\"  the  State  can\ngo forward with the sentence).\nInstead,  a challenge  to  a lethal  injection  protocol  is\nchallenge to  the way in which lethal  injection  is  carried  out.\n\n13\nSuch a challenge contends that  the failure  to insure proper\nanesthesia  through sufficient  and individualized  dosages of\nthe ultra-short  acting barbiturate  and the failure  to provide\nthat  adequately trained  individuals  carry out the execution\nresults  in a significant  likelihood of pain and suffering.  As\nsuch, a challenge to a lethal  i11iection protocol is equivalent\nto a conditions of confinementc laim. See id.  (reasoning that\na claim challenging an aspect of lethal  injection,  as opposed\nto lethal  injection itself  or execution moreg enerally, is 11o\ndifferent  than a \"’deliberate  indifference’  challenge to the\nconstitutionality\"  of a particular  procedure (quoting Estelle\nv.  Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976)).  Petitioner  does \nchallenge lethal  injection  as a methodo f execution or refuse\nto  concede reasonable alternatives.  See id.  at  645 (noting\nthat  petitioner  was not  unable  or  unwilling  to  concede\n\"acceptable  alternatives\"  to  the  challenged  procedure).\nPetitioner  challenges  certain  specific  aspects  of  lethal\ninjection  protocol  and its  administration.  Thus, this  claim\ndoes  not  sound in  habeas  corpus  because  success  on the\nmerits will not \"necessarily imply that\"  the death sentence at\nissue is  unlawful. See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644.\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nFor the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  reverse\nthe  ruling  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the\nEleventh Circuit.\nRespectfully  submitted,\nJOHNJ .

Abdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, No. \n05-1036.    In  the  course  of  litigating  the  constitutional \nquestion before the courts of Tennessee, amici undertook an \nextensive review of lethal injection protocols and the dangers \nthat arise under those protocols that condemned inmates will \nunnecessarily  be  subjected  to  extreme  pain  and  suffering \nduring the execution process.  While the case currently before \nthe Court concerns the question whether prisoners can use 42 \nU.S.C.  1983  to  challenge  execution  protocols,  it  may  be \nuseful to the Court in analyzing that question to understand \nthe  grave  Eighth  Amendment  concerns  posed  by  common \nexecution protocols.  The particular expertise developed by \namici should aid the Court’s consideration of the issues raised \nby this case. \nSTATEMENT \nThis  Court  granted  certiorari  to  decide  whether  a \ncondemned prisoner may challenge the protocol under which \nhe will be executed in an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 or \nwhether such an action is instead properly characterized as a \nprohibited  successive  habeas  application.  In  the  view  of \namici, the question whether Congress intended to permit such \na  suit  is  properly  informed  by  an  understanding  of  the \nsubstantial constitutional claim that the state’s position would \npreclude. Amici in this brief accordingly addresses the merits \nof  the  underlying  Eighth  Amendment  claim  presented  by \ncases such as this one. \n                                                 \n1 No counsel for either party has authored any portion of this \nbrief, nor has any person or entity, other than amici and their \ncounsel,  made  a  monetary  contribution  to  the  preparation  or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\n2 \nThirty-five states use a three-drug cocktail for executing \ncondemned prisoners. See Evans v. Saar, 2006 WL 274476, \nat *2 (D. Md. Feb. 1, 2006). Although there is some variation \namong the procedures used, the primary components are the \nsame. See Deborah W. Denno, When Legislatures Delegate \nDeath:  The  Troubling  Paradoxes  Behind  State  Uses  of \nElectrocution and Lethal Injection and What it Says About \nUs, 63 OHIO ST. L.J. 63, 97-99 (2002). The principal features \nare the use of sodium thiopental (also commonly known as \nsodium Pentothal), Pavulon, and potassium chloride. Ibid. \n Since the adoption of the first lethal injection protocol \nby Oklahoma in 1977, other states have essentially copied \nexisting  protocols,  without  any  independent  analysis  or \nscientific  investigation,  and  with  little  or  no  legislative \nattention  to  the  form  of  the  particular  protocol  employed. \nHenry  Weinstein,  State  Will  Help  Shape  Fate  of  Lethal \nInjection, L.A. TIMES, Feb. 23, 2006, at A1 (quoting Kent \nScheidegger,  legal  director  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Legal \nFoundation in Sacramento, as noting that “states just seemed \nto  copy  [the  Oklahoma  protocol]  without  much  scientific \nbackup for what they adopted”); see infra note 10. Tennessee, \nfor example, “copied other states in developing its method.” \nAbdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, No. 02-2236-III, slip op. at 9 \n(Tenn. Ch. Ct. filed June 1, 2003).2 An ad hoc committee \n                                                 \n2 There is also little doubt that Florida, the state in which \npetitioner  is  scheduled  to  be  executed,  copied  other  states, \nparticularly Texas, in adopting its protocol in 2000. Not only is the \nFlorida  protocol  typical  in  using  a  three-drug  chemical \ncombination, Denno, supra, at 146, but Florida also specifically \nuses two grams of sodium Pentothal, just like Texas. Compare Sims \nv. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 666 n.17 (Fla. 2000), with Leonidas G. \nKoniaris  et  al.,  Inadequate  Anesthesia  in  Lethal  Injection  for \nExecution, 356 LANCET 1412, 1412 (2005) (usual dosage in Texas \nand Virginia is two grams). See also COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL \nJUSTICE,  THE  FLORIDA  SENATE,  A  MONITOR:  METHODS  OF \nEXECUTION  &  PROTOCOL  (1997),  available  at \nhttp://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/monitor/contmon.html  (last \n\n3 \ncomposed of Department of Correction personnel3 adopted \nthe state’s protocol without consulting physicians or any other \npersons  with  medical  or  scientific  training,  id.  at  2,  and \nwithout  seeking  any  public  input,  Abdur’Rahman  v. \nBredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 300 (Tenn. 2005). \nThis  wholesale  imitation  has  produced  a  number  of \nserious problems. For example, state officials have included \nPavulon  in  their  protocols  although  the  drug  serves  no \nfunction in the execution, neither anesthetizing nor killing the \nprisoner. Denno, supra, at 100. What Pavulon does do is to \nparalyze the prisoner, which can make him feel that he is \nsuffocating  to  death  if  he  is  not  properly  anesthetized. \nBeardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1071 (CA9), cert. \ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 982 (2005). The possibility of such cruel, \nconscious suffering has resulted in thirty states passing laws \n“banning, in whole or in part, the use of neuromuscular agents \nas a means of euthanizing animals.” See infra at 17-18.   \nAdditionally, most states do not even mention training in \ntheir protocols. Denno, supra, at 121. “Criteria for selecting \nor  training  executioners  in  these  states  appear  to  be \nnonexistent.”  Id.  at  122.  Even  in  states  like  Virginia  and \nTexas, where the cocktail is often administered by emergency \nmedical  technicians,  those  technicians  are  not  trained  to \nadminister anesthesia. Leonidas G. Koniaris et al., Inadequate \nAnaesthesia in Lethal Injection for Execution, 365 LANCET \n1412, 1412 (Apr. 16, 2005).  \nFurther,  protocols  generally  fail  to  account  for  the \nvarying size and medical history of prisoners – facts critical to \n                                                                                                     \nvisited Mar. 3, 2006) (a survey of other states’ execution methods, \nparticularly focusing on Texas in connection with lethal injection). \n3 As in twenty other states, Tennessee’s legislature delegated \nthe task of developing an execution protocol to state administrative \nofficials. See Tenn. Code Ann. 40-23-114; see also infra note 9. \n\n4 \ndosage  decisions.4 Denno,  supra,  at  109-10.  Indeed,  most \nstates fail even to specify the dosage that the executioners are \nto  use  under  normal  circumstances,  making  it  difficult  to \nascertain whether the amount used is proper in any particular \ncase. Id. at 99. Many states’ protocols, including those of \nTennessee and Texas, also call for remote administration of \nthe anesthesia, Abdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, Ch. Ct. slip op. \nat 4; Koniaris et al., supra, at 1412, and fail to require the \nexecutioner to verify that the prisoner is anesthetized before \nproceeding, Abdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, Ch. Ct. slip op. at 4. \nAdditionally, under the Tennessee protocol the syringes are \nnot  labeled  with  the  chemical  name,  but  rather  are  color-\ncoded – a feature that substantially increases the likelihood of \nerror in administering the cocktail. Ibid. All of these factors \ncreate a realistic risk that a prisoner might be insufficiently \nanesthetized when the Pavulon takes effect. Denno, supra, at \n109.  \nFinally, the Tennessee Department of Correction’s policy \nregarding storage of the perishable cocktail components is \nalso flawed. Although Department of Correction personnel \nare aware that sodium Pentothal has a short shelf life, the \nanesthetic is at times stored for more than six months before \nuse, making it likely that the mixture will lose some of its \npotency.  3  Trial  Tran.  273-76,  321  (Abdur’Rahman  v. \nSundquist, No. 02-2236-III (Tenn. Ch. Ct.)). Additionally, the \nsodium Pentothal powder must be mixed with sterile water \nbefore the execution – a procedure necessary to ensure that \nthe proper amount is administered, and yet one performed by \nthe  Warden,  who  possesses  neither  medical  nor  scientific \ntraining. Abdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, Ch. Ct. slip op. at 3. \nContamination of the solution during mixing can also reduce \nits potency. 2 Trial Tr. 129-30 (Abdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, \nNo. 02-2236-III (Tenn. Ch. Ct.)). \n                                                 \n4 The  protocol  also  fails  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that \nsodium Pentothal can, if improperly administered, actually cause \nheightened sensitivity to pain. See Sims, 754 So. 2d at 668 n.19.  \n\n5 \nVarious protocols also create unique risks of error. The \nFlorida  protocol,  for  example,  specifically  provides  that  a \nprisoner be served his last meal an hour before the execution, \nSims, 754 So. 2d at 657 n.18 – a practice contrary to standard \nanesthesia protocols prohibiting the consumption of food or \nfluid  so  close  in  time  to  the  administration  of  sodium \nPentothal. See Denno, supra, at 123. Only six other states \nprescribe  the  amount  of  time  that  must  pass  between  a \nprisoner’s  last  meal  and  administration  of  the  sodium \nPentothal. Ibid. The range varies from two to three hours, as \nrequired by Texas, and not less than eight hours, as required \nby New Jersey. Ibid.  \nAll  of  these  flaws  in  the  lethal  injection  protocols \nemployed in Tennessee and elsewhere increase the likelihood \nthat the sodium Pentothal will not work as intended and thus \nthat the prisoner will not be adequately anesthetized. “The \nevidence  is  essentially  uncontradicted that the injection of \neither Pavulon or potassium chloride, by themselves, in the \ndosages required by Tennessee’s three-drug protocol would \ncause  excruciating  pain.”  Abdur’Rahman  v.  Bredesen,  No. \nM2003-01767-COA-R3-CV, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 643, at \n**62-63 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2004). If the Pavulon is \nadministered  while  the  prisoner  still  has  sensation,  the \nprisoner will be able to think and experience pain and fear; as \nhis diaphragm and lungs are paralyzed by the Pavulon, he will \nfeel himself being asphyxiated. Abdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, \nCh. Ct. slip op. at 5. And while that is happening, he will be \nutterly  incapable  of  expressing  the  fact  or  extent  of  his \nsuffering.  Ibid.  The  potassium  chloride  used  in  these \nprotocols will also “cause extreme pain and suffering” if the \nsodium Pentothal does not have its intended anesthetic effect. \nAbdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d at 307. “Without \nsedation, the injection of potassium chloride would * * * \ndeliver the maximum amount of pain the veins can deliver.” \nAbdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 643, at \n*63 (internal quotation omitted).   \n\n6 \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Needless Use of Pavulon in Florida’s Execution \nProtocol  Is  Unconstitutional  Under  This  Court’s \nPrecedents. \nThe  lethal  injection  protocols  challenged  in  this  and \nsimilar  cases  give  rise  to  substantial  claims  of  Eighth \nAmendment  violations.  There  is  no  reason  to  think  that \nCongress  would  have  intended  the  habeas  statutes  to \nimmunize the states from such claims. \nA.    The Purposeless Use of Pavulon Reflects the \n  States’ Deliberate Indifference to the Risk \n  of Needless Suffering. \n1. As both courts and experts have found, Pavulon serves \nno legitimate purpose in an execution by lethal injection. See, \ne.g., Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1075-76 (CA9) \n(describing  California’s  failure  to  explain  inclusion  of \nPavulon  in  its  execution  protocol  as,  “to  say  the  least, \ntroubling”),  cert.  denied,  543  U.S.  1096  (2005); \nAbdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, No. 02-2236-III, slip op. at 13 \n(Tenn. Ch. Ct. filed June 1, 2003); cf. Adam Liptak, Critics \nSay Execution Drug May Hide Suffering, N.Y. TIMES, Oct. 7, \n2003, at A7 (reporting comment of Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland: \n“it makes no sense to use a muscle relaxant in executing \npeople”).  Indeed,  as  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court \nemphasized, on the state’s view that the prison officials will \nimplement the protocol flawlessly, the first drug – “a dosage \nof five grams of sodium Pentothal” – will “cause[] nearly \nimmediate  unconsciousness  and  eventually  death.” \nAbdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 307-08 (Tenn. \n2005). \nBecause  the  use  of  Pavulon  –  or,  for  that  matter, \npotassium  chloride  –  in  the  execution  protocol  serves  no \nlegitimate purpose, it has only three possible effects. First, if \nthe prisoner is not properly anesthetized, the Pavulon will \n\n7 \n“cause  extreme  pain  and  suffering”  as  he  begins  to \nasphyxiate. Abdur’Rahman, 181 S.W.3d at 307. Second, the \nPavulon will paralyze all of the prisoner’s voluntary muscles, \ncreating a “chemical veil” that precludes correctional officials \nand  witnesses  (including  the  prisoner’s  attorney)  from \ndetecting the extraordinary pain suffered by him as a result of \nthe  Pavulon-induced  asphyxiation  and,  subsequently,  the \npotassium chloride. Id. at 302. Finally, even if the sodium \nPentothal is properly administered, the Pavulon effectively \n“sanitizes”  the  execution  for  onlookers  by  “prevent[ing] \nseizures that often occur after cardiac arrest induced by the \nadministration of potassium chloride that could be interpreted \nerroneously  by  lay  observers  as  pain  or  discomfort.” \nBeardslee, 395 F.3d at 1076 n.13 (citing testimony of the \nstate’s expert witness).  \nIt is well established that imposing a pointless risk of \nextraordinary  pain  is  unconstitutional.  The  Eighth \nAmendment prohibits punishment that involves “torture or a \nlingering death,” In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447 (1890), or \n“the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” Gregg v. \nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976); Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. \n730,  737  (2002)  (“[A]mong  unnecessary  and  wanton \ninflictions  of  pain  are  those  that  are  totally  without \npenological justification.”) (internal quotations omitted). \nThe officials who promulgated and who carry out these \nexecution  protocols  have  displayed  precisely  the  kind  of \ndeliberate indifference to pointless suffering that this Court \nhas  repeatedly  deemed  unconstitutional  in  cases  such  as \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (“[D]eliberate \nindifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes \nthe ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ proscribed by \nthe Eighth Amendment.”) (citation omitted), and Helling v. \nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 32 (1993). Further, one “may infer \nthe existence of this subjective state of mind from the fact that \nthe risk of harm is obvious.” Hope, 536 U.S. at 738 (citing \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842 (1994)).  \n\n8 \nThe  enormous  risks  inherent  in  the  lethal  injection \nprotocols have long been obvious. Indeed, even before the \nfirst execution by lethal injection, condemned prisoners in \nTexas and Oklahoma argued that the newly adopted protocols \n“may actually result in agonizingly slow and painful deaths \nthat are far more barbaric than those caused by the more \ntraditional means of execution.” Inmates Ask Ban on Drugs as \nMethod of Execution, N.Y. TIMES, Jan. 8, 1981, at A13 (citing \nthe petition in Chaney v. Heckler). And in 1983, the D.C. \nCircuit found that the prisoners “ha[d] presented substantial \nand  uncontroverted  evidence  to  support  their  claim  that \nexecution by lethal injection poses a serious risk of cruel, \nprotracted death,” noting that “[e]ven a slight error in dosage \nor administration can leave a prisoner conscious but paralyzed \nwhile  dying,  a  sentient  witness  of  his  or  her  own  slow, \nlingering asphyxiation.” Chaney v. Heckler, 718 F.2d 1174, \n1191 (1983) (citations omitted), rev’d on other grounds, 470 \nU.S. 821 (1985); cf. Resps. Br. 90 n.44, Heckler v. Chaney, \n470  U.S.  821,  No.  83-1878  (1985)  (citing  an  expert  for \nplaintiff-respondent  prisoners:  “The  determination  of  the \nproper dosage of drugs for a lethal injection would also be a \ndifficult task * * *. If thiopental and tubocurarine were given \nin sequence, one might not be effective before the other. For \nexample, if not enough thiopental were given and it were \nfollowed by curare, the prisoner could be awake and he would \ndie in physical and mental agony.”).5 Similarly, the medical \ncommunity expressed public concern regarding the prospect \nof technical problems in finding a vein and adjusting dosages. \nSee  William  J.  Curran  &  Ward  Casscells,  The  Ethics  of \n                                                 \n5 Both  Pavulon  and  tubocurarine  are  “chemical  paralyzing \nagents”  that  were  considered  in  connection  with  the  original \nOklahoma protocol. Denno, supra, at 98 n.223. Pavulon is also a \nmember  of  the  “curariform  class  of  drugs.”  MICROMEDEX \nHEALTHCARE  SERIES:  DRUGDEX:  DRUG  POINT,  Pancuronium \nBromide, available at www.micromedex.com (last visited Mar. 5, \n2006). \n\n9 \nMedical Participation in Capital Punishment by Intravenous \nDrug Injection, 302 NEW ENG.

SUN, Jan. 28, \n2006, at 1B (reporting on expert testimony of possibility of \nbotched execution of prisoner in Maryland in 2004).7 \n                                                 \n6 A “botched execution” is one in which complications arose \nthat resulted in the inmate undergoing pain and suffering that would \nnot occur in an error-free execution. \n7 A high ratio of failure is consistent with the estimated error \nrate of at least one prominent expert. See Charles M. Madigan, A \n\n10 \nGiven these well-documented problems,8 state officials \nare indisputably aware of the risks inherent in their states’ \nlethal injection protocol. Indeed, despite the secrecy that often \nshrouds state lethal injection protocols, see Denno, supra, at \n116-17, state officials are known to have been specifically \naware  of  problems  with  previous  executions  by  lethal \ninjection.  See,  e.g.,  Trial  Ex.  14;  2  Trial  Tr.  264,  271; \nAbdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, Ch. Ct. slip op. at 13 (Tennessee \nofficials aware of previous problems in Texas and Arkansas \nand in their own state’s practice sessions); COMMITTEE ON \nCRIMINAL  JUSTICE,  THE  FLORIDA  SENATE,  A  MONITOR: \nMETHODS OF EXECUTION & PROTOCOL (1997), available at \nhttp://www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/methods/emstates.html \n(last  visited  Mar.  4,  2006)  (demonstrating  awareness  of \nproblems encountered in other states with lethal injection). \nState officials have also not re-evaluated the risks associated \nwith  the  drugs  employed  in  the  typical  lethal  injection \nprotocol in light of the fact that the use of neuromuscular \nblocking  agents  such  as  Pavulon  is  prohibited  for  animal \neuthanasia in thirty states, see infra note 11.  \nDespite their awareness of the risks involved, states do \nnot  even  take  the  simple  step  of  assuring  by  physical \nexamination that a prisoner has reached a surgical plane of \nanesthesia  before  administering  drugs  that  undisputedly \nwould cause pain to an inadequately anesthetized individual. \n                                                                                                     \nFederal  Killing;  Q&A  with  Dr.  Edward  Brunner;  It’s  Only  a \nPainless Death if You’re the One Watching, CHI. TRIB., Apr. 22, \n2001, at C1 (“We know that in about 40 percent of cases where \nlethal injection has been used, there has been misuse in one way or \nanother * * *.”). \n8 Ironically, the fact that these concerns about the protocols \nhave long been recognized has even been used against condemned \ninmates seeking review of the method of execution. See Harris v. \nJohnson, 376 F.3d 414, 419 n.4 (CA5 2004) (“Harris’s own filings \ndemonstrate that the substance of his complaint has been factually \navailable for the entirety of his term on death row [since 1986].”). \n\n11 \nAs such, the problems inherent in lethal injection protocols \ncannot be dismissed as the kind of “unforeseeable accident” \nthat  this  Court  has  declined  to  hold  unconstitutional.  See \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 105 (quoting Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. \nResweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947)). Rather, the problems \ndescribed  are  the  direct  and  inevitable  consequence  of  a \npoorly  designed  protocol  carried  out  by  unqualified \npersonnel.  \nThe fact that this conscious disregard is widespread does \nnot  immunize  it  from  attack.  A  state  surely  could  not, \nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, adopt a protocol that \nwould omit the sodium Pentothal for every one-hundredth \ncondemned prisoner, torturing that prisoner to death. It would \nmake no difference in that case if all fifty states did the same \nthing. It should similarly make no difference that the prospect \nof  a  tortuous  death  arises  from  the  known  risk  of  a \npreventable accident when the State imposes that risk for no \npurpose whatsoever. \n  2.    Nor  is  it  any  answer  to  a  prisoner’s  Eighth \nAmendment claim that the risk of inadequate anesthesia – \nand, thus, the likelihood that a prisoner will suffer severe pain \nfrom the Pavulon and potassium chloride – is small.  \nFirst, even if the risk were small, there is simply no need \nto expose anyone to such a risk given that the use of Pavulon \n(and potassium chloride) is both entirely gratuitous and could \ncause inhuman pain. See supra at 5-7. That risk is particularly \nunreasonable  given  that  simpler  and  more  humane \nalternatives – such as a single dose of pentobarbital – are not \nonly  readily  available,  but  in  fact  widely  used  in  animal \neuthanasia.  See  Abdur’Rahman  v.  Bredesen,  No.  M2003-\n01767-COA-R3-CV, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 643, at **23-\n24 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2004). \nSecond, the mere presence of the risk injures prisoners \nfacing the prospect of death by lethal injection. This Court \nhas long held that the Eighth Amendment protects not only \nagainst “physical mistreatment [and] primitive torture,” Trop \nv. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion), but \n\n12 \nalso against undue psychological injury, including a “fate of \never-increasing fear and distress,” id. at 102. Here, a prisoner \nwill  likely  experience  extreme  psychological  terror  simply \nfrom  knowing  that,  as  a  result  of  the  myriad  flaws  in \nprotocols such as Florida’s, and in mute and unacknowledged \nterror, he may experience extraordinary pain from the effects \nof the Pavulon and potassium chloride. \n3. In  any  event,  the  risk  that  a  prisoner  will  suffer \nextraordinary pain as a result of flaws in the lethal injection \nprotocol is genuine. There are many types of needless risks \nthat  any  prisoner  exposed  to  a  protocol  that  uses  a \nneuromuscular blocking agent, like Pavulon, after an ultra-\nfast acting barbiturate, like sodium Penothal, must face. See \nsupra at 3-5. These risks are exacerbated when states adopt an \noverly  complex  method  for  delivering  the  drugs.  In \nTennessee,  for  example,  the  unnecessary  injection  of  two \nsyringes  of  Pavulon,  coupled  with  the  syringe  of  saline \nsolution  required  to  prevent  the  sodium  Pentothal  from \ncrystallizing  on  contact  with  the  Pavulon,  substantially \nincreases  the  length  and  complexity  of  the  procedure. \nAbdur’Rahman v. Sundquist, Ch. Ct. slip op. at 4. Similarly, \nin Florida, eight syringes are used, Sims, 754 So. 2d at 665 \nn.17, and in Oklahoma, “three lay-executioners * * * plunge \neleven hand held syringes in a confusing and complicated \nsequence to deliver the deadly drugs.” Compl. 11, Anderson \nv. Evans, No. CIV-05-0825F, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1632 \n(W.D. Okla. 2006).   \nB.    Use of Pavulon in Lethal Injection Protocols \n  Is Not Supported by Evolving Standards of \n  Decency  and  Is  in  Any  Case \n  Unconstitutional  Under  Other  Eighth \n  Amendment Standards.  \n1.  In determining whether a form of punishment is cruel \nor  unusual,  this  Court  has  often  looked  to  “the  ‘evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing \nsociety.’”  Roper  v.  Simmons,  543  U.S.  551,  561  (2005) \n\n13 \n(quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)). To the \nmaximum extent possible, courts should infer those standards \nfrom objective evidence. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, \n312 (2002). As this Court has stated, “[t]he clearest and most \nreliable”  such  evidence  is  “the  legislation  enacted  by  the \ncountry’s legislatures.” Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 331 \n(1989), overruled on other grounds, Atkins, 536 U.S. 304. In \nthis case, however, the widespread use of very similar lethal \ninjection protocols cannot be said to reflect any legislative \nconsensus  or  determination  that  such  protocols  are \nappropriate, much less that they reflect contemporary values. \nFirst, although thirty-five states use a three-cocktail protocol \ncomposed  of  sodium  Pentothal,  Pavulon,  and  potassium \nchloride, twenty-one of those states – including Tennessee \nand  Florida  –  did  not  enact  legislation  that  specifically \nprescribed the form of the protocol.9 As such, those states \ncould not have made any legislative determination that the \nlethal injection protocols employed by correctional officials \nreflected contemporary values. Cf. Thompson v. Oklahoma, \n487 U.S. 815, 826 (1988) (plurality opinion) (in considering \nconstitutionality  of  death  penalty  for  fifteen-year-olds, \ndeclining  to  consider  states  that  either  prohibited  capital \npunishment or failed to explicitly set a minimum age for the \n                                                 \n9 See Ala.

Although neither Kansas nor New \nYork prescribes the form of the protocol, see Kan. Stat. Ann. 22-\n4001(a); N.Y. Correct. Law 658, courts in those states have held \nthe  states’  death  penalty  statutes  unconstitutional,  see  State  v. \nMarsh, 102 P.3d 445 (Kan. 2004), cert. granted, 125 S. Ct. 2017 \n(2005); People v. LaValle, 817 N.E.2d 341 (N.Y. 2004). \n\n14 \ndeath  penalty,  explaining  that  “[i]f  *  *  *  we  accept  the \npremise that some offenders are simply too young to be put to \ndeath, it is reasonable to put this group of statutes to one side \nbecause  they  do  not  focus  on  the  question  of  where  the \nchronological  age  line  should  be  drawn”).  Instead,  those \nstates merely enacted a statute that deemed lethal injection an \napproved or preferred method of execution and left it to state \nadministrative officials to determine the protocol for carrying \nout  that  legislative  judgment.  In  developing  the  protocol, \nthose state officials consistently failed both to invite public \ncomment and to make any inquiry into prevailing community \nstandards; indeed, in some states, details of the protocol are \nnot even made available to the public once established. See, \ne.g.,  Harris  v.  Johnson,  376  F.3d  414,  420  (CA5  2004) \n(Dennis,  J.,  dissenting)  (noting  that  Texas  has  refused  to \n“disclose any reliable information regarding [its] unpublished \nnon-statutory  lethal  injection  protocol”);  Denno,  supra,  at \n181,  207-60  (noting  that  same  states,  like  Kentucky, \nMississippi, New Hampshire, and Wyoming, have no written \nprotocol,  and  that  the  protocols  of  other  states,  including \nNevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia, are not \npublic information).  \nEven in the fourteen states that have enacted legislation \nspecifically requiring the use of particular drugs in the lethal \ninjection protocol, the legislation does not expressly require \nthe use of particular drugs, but instead merely prescribes the \nuse of certain types of drugs – generally an “ultra-short-acting \nbarbiturate”  (such  as  sodium  Pentothal)  and  a  “chemical \nparalytic agent” (such as Pavulon) – in a certain sequence. \nMoreover, as the language of those states’ lethal injection \nstatutes  suggest,  it  appears  likely  that  those  states  simply \ncopied the statute created by the Oklahoma legislature10 – the \n                                                 \n10 For example, Idaho and New Mexico (two of the first four \nstates to move to lethal injection) adopted the Oklahoma statute \nalmost  verbatim.  Compare  Okla.  Stat.  tit.  22.1014  (“The \npunishment of death must be inflicted by continuous, intravenous \n\n15 \nfirst state to adopt lethal injection as an available method of \n                                                                                                     \nadministration  of  a  lethal  quantity  of  an  ultrashort-acting \nbarbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until \ndeath is pronounced by a licensed physician * * *.”), with Idaho \nCode Ann. 19-2716 (“The punishment of death shall be inflicted by \ncontinuous, intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an \nultra-short-acting  barbiturate  in  combination  with  a  chemical \nparalytic agent until death is pronounced by a physician * * *.”), \nand N.M. Stat. 31-14-11 (“The manner of inflicting punishment of \ndeath  shall  be  by  administration  of  a  continuous,  intravenous \ninjection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate in \ncombination with a chemical paralytic agent.”).  \nThe copycatting trend continued as more states adopted lethal \ninjection as the preferred or exclusive method of execution. See \nArk. Code Ann. 5-4-617 (prescribing use of an “ultrashort-acting \nbarbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent”); Md. \nCode Ann., Corr. Servs. 3-905 (same); Miss.

Ct. slip op. at 13 (“[Tennessee] \n‘copy-catted,’ using what a majority of other states were doing, \nincluding the use of Pavulon.”); Opp’n to Emergency Motion for \nStay of Execution at 37, Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029 (CA9 \n2004)  (No.  04-99001)  (according  to  the  Attorney  General  of \nCalifornia, “[i]n developing California’s lethal-injection protocol, \nthe Warden of San Quentin consulted other wardens and visited \nTexas  and  observed  their  procedures  being  carried  out  by \nwitnessing  an  execution”);  Keith  Epstein, Cruel  and  Unusual?, \nTAMPA TRIB., Feb. 21, 2006, at 1 (“The [Oklahoma] technique \nspread, to Texas and then other states without much investigation \nor planning, although the original Oklahoma potion involved two \ndrugs, not three.”); Tony Rizzo, Painless or Cruel, Unusual?, KAN. \nCITY STAR, Feb. 12, 2006 at A1 (“Texas copied and passed the law \nthe day after Oklahoma did.”); Kevin Simpson, Debate Flares over \nInjections: Critics Say Lethal Shots Not Humane, DENVER POST, \nSept. 15, 1997, at A1 (discussing Colorado officials studying Texas \nprotocol). \n\n16 \nexecution.  Had  Oklahoma’s  decision  been  the  result  of \nconsiderable  discussion  and  had  it  reflected  the  prevailing \nviews of both the medical community and the public, other \nstates’  verbatim  adoption  of  Oklahoma’s  statute  might  be \nreasonable. To the contrary, however, the Oklahoma statute \nappears  to  reflect  the  suggestion  of  a  single  doctor.  See \nDenno, supra, at 95-97. Accordingly, neither the decision of \nthe Oklahoma legislature nor the subsequent adoption of that \nprotocol by other states can be said to represent the reasoned \njudgments  of  state  legislators or the views of the citizens \nthereby represented.  \n2.  Furthermore, societal consensus regarding standards \nof decency is properly measured by looking at the entire array \nof laws that illuminate how society thinks about the practice \nbeing challenged under the Eighth Amendment. In Roper v. \nSimmons,  for  example,  this  Court  referred  to  an  array  of \nlegislation  recognizing  the  comparative  immaturity  and \nirresponsibility of juveniles in holding that the juvenile death \npenalty violated society’s evolving standards of decency. 543 \nU.S. at 569.   \nHere,  the  widespread  prohibition  on  the  use  of \nneuromuscular blocking agents such as Pavulon in animal \neuthanasia reflects a national consensus that Pavulon is an \ninhumane method of causing death. Thirty states – twenty-\nthree of which impose capital punishment – prohibit the use \nof  Pavulon  in  euthanizing  animals. 11  These  laws  are \n                                                 \n11  Nine  states,  including  Florida  and  Tennessee,  ban \nneuromuscular agents explicitly. See Fla. Stat. 828.058 & 828.065; \nGa. Code Ann. 4-11-5.1; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, 1044; Md. \nCode Ann., Crim. Law, 10-611; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, 151A; \nN.J. Stat. Ann. 4:22-19.3; N.Y. Agric. & Mkts. Law 374; Okla. \nStat. tit. 4, 501; Tenn. Code Ann. 44-17-303. \nTwenty-one  more  states  prohibit  the  use  of  such \nneuromuscular  blocking  agents  by  implication,  either  by \nspecifically mandating a method for animal euthanasia that does \nnot  involve  the  use  of  a  neuromuscular  blocking  agent  or  by \n\n17 \nparticularly  instructive  because  they  reflect  a  considered \njudgment  by  the  legislatures  that  enacted  them.  See \nThompson, 487 U.S. at 829 (examining only the states that \nhad  “expressly  established  a  minimum  age  in  their  death \npenalty statutes”). \nMoreover,  this  widespread  legislative  consensus  is \nconsistent with the national ethical standards promulgated by \nthe  American  Veterinary  Medical  Association’s  Panel  on \nEuthanasia.  The  Panel  has  deemed  “unacceptable”  and \n“absolutely condemned” the use of neuromuscular blocking \nagents for animal euthanasia. American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation Panel on Euthanasia, 1993 Report of the AVMA \nPanel on Euthanasia, 202 J. A.V.M.A. 229 (1993); American \nVeterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia, 2000 \nReport of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia, 218 J. A.V.M.A. \n669, 675, 681 (2001). Instead, the AVMA standards require \nthat a medically qualified individual stay in constant contact \nwith the patient to be euthanized so that an assessment of \nmuscle  tone  and  breathing  can  be  made  and  an  accurate \nassessment of patient pain or distress can be made. The same \nconcerns  animating  the  prohibition  on  the  use  of \nneuromuscular  blocking  agents  to  euthanize  animals  apply \nequally to the use of Pavulon in executing humans: viz., the \nrisk that the animal will be inadequately anesthetized and thus \n(without the knowledge of the veterinarians administering the \n                                                                                                     \notherwise  expressing  a  legislative  preference  for  sodium \npentobarbital: Ala.

Although  the  Eighth  Amendment  “draw[s]  its \nmeaning from * * * evolving standards of decency,” Trop v. \nDulles,  356  U.S.  86,  101  (1958)  (plurality  opinion),  this \nCourt’s  cases  “also  make  clear  that  public  perceptions  of \nstandards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are \nnot conclusive,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976) \n(joint opinion of Stevens, Stewart, and Powell, JJ.). Thus, as \nthis Court has recognized, the Eighth Amendment prohibits \npunishment that involves “torture or a lingering death.” In re \nKemmler,  136  U.S.  436,  447  (1890).  Relying  on  this \nprohibition, at least one circuit has held for a decade that a \nlingering death by asphyxiation – precisely the kind of death \nthat a prisoner would suffer if inadequately anesthetized – \nwould  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment.  See  Beardslee  v. \nWoodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1070 (CA9) (construing Fierro v. \nGomez, 77 F.3d 301, 308 (CA9), vacated on other grounds, \n519 U.S. 918 (1996)), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1096 (2005). In \nBeardslee, the court of appeals explained that its holding in \nFierro  –  which  deemed  California’s  lethal  gas  execution \nprotocol  unconstitutional  –  rested  on  the  district  court’s \nfinding that “inmates were likely to remain conscious for up \nto a minute after the execution procedure commenced and \nthat  there  was  a  substantial  likelihood  that  some \nconsciousness would persist for several minutes during which \n‘inmates suffer intense, visceral pain, primarily as a result of \nlack of oxygen to the cells.’” Ibid.  \nEven putting aside the risk that a prisoner will suffer \nextreme pain as a result of a flawed lethal injection protocol, \nthe  lethal  injection  protocols  are  unconstitutional  for  the \nfurther reason that they violate the prisoner’s human dignity, \nwhich  is  “[t]he  basic  concept  underlying  the  Eighth \nAmendment.” Trop, 356 U.S. at 100. Specifically, it is deeply \noffensive to a prisoner’s dignity to be subjected to the use of \nPavulon when thirty states have expressly deemed that drug \ninappropriate  for  euthanizing  animals.  As  Justice  Brennan \n\n19 \nexplained in Furman v. Georgia, “[m]ore than the presence of \npain * * * is comprehended in the judgment that the extreme \nseverity of a punishment makes it degrading to the dignity of \nhuman  beings.”  408  U.S.  238,  272  (1972)  (Brennan,  J., \nconcurring). Rather, the “true significance of these [barbaric] \npunishments is that they treat members of the human race as \nnonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded.” Id. at \n272-73.  The  use  of  Pavulon  goes  even  further,  reducing \nprisoners subjected to such treatment to less than animals in \nthe eyes of the law. \nThe subjugation of prisoners to inhumane treatment also \ncorrodes the integrity of the criminal justice system, which, as \nthis Court has explained, “depends on full compliance with \nthe Eighth Amendment.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 \n(2005). That integrity is undermined when, as here, there is a \nrealistic  risk  that  a  prisoner  will  undergo  extraordinary \nphysical and psychological pain as a result of drugs that are \nentirely unnecessary to the execution. The use of Pavulon in \nthe protocol is all the more objectionable for its effect of \nmasking  the  suffering  that  the  protocol  inflicts,  thereby \nenabling executioners and witnesses to suspend disbelief and \nimagine a humane death. See Denno, supra, at 100. \nC.    It  Is  Important  that  Prisoners  Have \n  Adequate Legal Channels, Including § 1983 \n  Actions,  Through  Which  To  Challenge \n  Unconstitutional Means of Execution.  \nGiven  the  substantial  risk  of  unnecessary  pain  and \nsuffering  that  lethal  injection  protocols  like  Florida  and \nTennessee’s present, it is essential that prisoners have access \nto the legal channels that § 1983 provides so that they may \nchallenge that means of execution, regardless of whether state \nremedies are available to them. As this Court stated over forty \nyears ago in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183 (1961), \noverruled on other grounds, Monell v. N.Y. City Dep’t of Soc. \nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 664-89 (1978), “[i]t is no answer that \nthe State has a law which if enforced would give relief. The \n\n20 \nfederal remedy [provided by § 1983] is supplementary to the \nstate  remedy,  and  the  latter  need  not  be  first  sought  and \nrefused  before  the  federal  one  is  invoked.”  “Thus, \noverlapping  state  remedies  are  generally  irrelevant  to  the \nquestion of the existence of a cause of action under § 1983.” \nZinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 124 (1990).  \nIn  any  event,  the  availability  of  state  remedies  to \nchallenge a lethal injection protocol is very much in doubt. In \nthe  majority  of  states  using  the  lethal  injection  protocol \nsimilar to the one at issue in this case, the particular protocol \nused is not mandated by state law, but is instead the result of \nan administrative decision made by a state’s department of \ncorrections.  See  supra  at  13-14.  And  while  most  states \nprovide  some  mechanism  to  challenge  administrative \ndecisions  generally,  see  Abdur’Rahman  v.  Bredesen,  181 \nS.W.3d 292, 2005 (Tenn. 2005) (challenging Tennessee lethal \ninjection  protocol  under  that  state’s  Administrative \nProcedures Act, which provides for judicial review of final \nadministrative decisions), many have specifically exempted \nthe  decisions  of  departments  of  corrections  from  judicial \nreview. Indeed, among the five states that have executed the \nmost prisoners since 1976, four of them – Texas, Virginia, \nOklahoma,  and  Florida  –  have  just  such  an  exclusion.12 \nTogether, these states have accounted for nearly sixty percent \nof all executions since 1976.13 \n                                                 \n12 See Fla.

Amici are keenly \ninterested in ensuring that their capital sentencing schemes \nremain viable.  Viability depends, in large part, on the States’ \nability to carry out duly-adjudicated death sentences in a \ntimely manner.  Eleventh-hour litigation like Hill’s fatally \nfrustrates that objective.  Amici thus respectfully urge this \nCourt to preclude death-sentenced inmates from filing last-\nminute execution-related claims – among them, challenges \nto the particular cocktail of chemicals that constitute a lethal \ninjection – under the banner of 42 U.S.C. §1983.  In so doing, \nthis  Court  will  both  (i)  enforce  the  carefully-crafted \nlimitations  that  Congress  has  expressly  written  into  the \nfederal  habeas  corpus  statute  and  (ii)  honor  the  States’ \ncompelling interest in finality. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \n1.  This Court should reject Hill’s argument that §1983 is \navailable  because  he  is  challenging  only  an  execution \n“procedure,” and not his execution per se.  In the real world, \nthere  is  no meaningful  distinction  between  the two, and \nexperience shows that an inmate can block an execution just \nas surely by challenging a “procedure” as by challenging his \nsentence directly.  The story of David Larry Nelson, with \nwhom this Court is familiar, is instructive.  On remand from \nthis  Court’s  decision  in  Nelson  v.  Campbell,  the  State  of \nAlabama took the challenged “cut-down” off the table as a \nmeans of accessing Nelson’s veins and agreed, instead, to \nutilize  Nelson’s  own  preferred  procedure,  “percutaneous \ncentral line placement,” which this Court had emphasized in \nallowing Nelson’s §1983 claim to proceed.  Although the \nState’s concession should have – according to Nelson’s own \nrepresentations to this Court – led promptly to Nelson’s \nexecution, such was not to be the case.  Instead, Nelson \nabout-faced  and,  incredibly,  attacked  his  own  chosen \n\n  2\nprocedure as “cruel and unusual.”  To its consternation, the \nState continues to this day to litigate Nelson’s (mutated) case \nin  district  court.    The  lesson  of  Nelson  is  simply  this:  \nExecution “procedures” are innumerable, and the incentive \nto  muster  and  mount  new  (and  even  contradictory) \nchallenges to those procedures as a means of delaying an \nimpending execution is overwhelming.  This Court’s §1983 \njurisprudence must account for that reality. \n2.  Hill’s chemical-composition claim, had it been filed in \na  habeas  corpus  petition,  would  have  been  barred  as \n“second  or  successive”  within  the  meaning  of  28  U.S.C. \n§2244(b)(2).  That provision states expressly that a claim, like \nHill’s,  that  rests  on  a  previously  unavailable  “factual \npredicate” may form the basis of a second habeas petition \nonly if it implicates the petitioning inmate’s actual innocence, \nwhich Hill’s plainly does not.   None of Hill’s efforts to avoid \n§2244(b)(2)’s plain language is persuasive.  First, it is not the \ncase  that  any  claim  that  might  not  have  constituted  an \n“abuse  of  the  writ”  under  pre-AEDPA  law  cannot  be \ndeemed  “second  or  successive”  within  the  meaning  of \namended  §2244(b)(2).    Any  such  argument  rests  on  the \nuntenable  premise  AEDPA  was  just  a  blip,  and  that  in \ncomprehensively  amending  the  habeas  statute  Congress \nmerely sought to codify business as usual.  Second, neither \nStewart v. Martinez-Villareal nor Slack v. McDaniel salvages \nHill’s counter-textual argument.  In both of those decisions, \nthis  Court  –  given  the  unique  procedural  circumstances \ninvolved – was able to permit claims to go forward without \nre-writing §2244(b)(2)’s clear text.  Hill’s broader contention, \nby contrast – that an inmate may file a second petition based \nsolely on a new claim’s newness, and even where his first \npetition was adjudicated on the merits – would break the \ncamel’s back.  Finally, it is no answer to suggest that there \nmight be some difference between (i) an inmate whose claim \nexisted  but  was  unavailable  when  he  litigated  his  first \nhabeas petition and (ii) one whose claim simply did not exist \nat  that  time.    That  distinction  cannot  be  squared  with \n§2244(b)(2)’s language, which (looking back to pre-AEDPA \n\n  3\nlaw) encompasses petitioners in both situations and requires \nboth to show innocence before proceeding.  Nor does it \ncomport with common sense; the equitable considerations \npertinent to both petitioners are identical in that neither can \nbe faulted for failing to raise his claim earlier. \n3.  Hill has not been denied a remedy here.  The record \nmakes clear that before rejecting Hill’s Eighth Amendment \nclaim the Florida Supreme Court considered it on the merits \nand in detail.  This Court then reviewed and denied Hill’s \npetition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  pertaining  to  the  Florida \ncourt’s merits decision.  Hill’s real argument – that he is \nentitled, one way or another, to litigate his claim in federal \ndistrict  court  –  has  been  rejected  before,  and  should  be \nrejected again.  In a line of decisions culminating in Allen v. \nMcCurry, this Court has (i) emphasized that state courts are \nfully capable of adjudicating federal constitutional claims \nand  (ii)  rejected  any  suggestion  that  just  because  a \nconstitutional claim is not cognizable on federal habeas, it \nmust be cognizable under §1983. \nARGUMENT \n“Obviously, a challenge to the chemicals used for lethal \ninjection constitutes a challenge to the sentence of death by \nlethal injection.”  That was petitioner David Larry Nelson’s \nposition  in  Nelson  v.  Campbell,  541  U.S.  637  (2004).    See \nPetitioner’s  Supplemental  Cert.  Reply  Br.  at  6.    Indeed, \nNelson’s lawyer reiterated that position time and time again \nin this Court.  See, e.g., Oral Arg. Tr. 13-14 (Q: “[W]ould you \nbe making the same argument [that §1983 is available] if his \ncomplaint  was  not  this  inch  cut  but  the  combination  of \nchemicals?”  A: “No, Your Honor.”); id. at 14 (Q: “[W]hat is \nthe difference between … your using a drug that’s going to \nhurt me and your using a catheter procedure that’s going to \nhurt me?”  A: “I think the primary difference, Justice Scalia, \nis that those are method of execution cases.”).  The point is \nnot, of course, that Nelson’s lawyer’s representations are \nbinding on anyone here.  The point is simply that there was \n\n  4\na time, not too long ago, when participants on both sides of \nthe debate agreed precisely how the question presented in \nthis case should be resolved – namely, against §1983 review. \nThe amici States are gravely concerned that this case \nrepresents a second step (Nelson being the first) along a road \nto allowing all manner of execution-related challenges to \nproceed via §1983 – at the cost of the finality interests that \nthe federal habeas corpus statute is designed to protect. \nAmici will address three issues:  (i) the fallacy that there \nis, in the real world, any meaningful difference between a \nchallenge to an execution “procedure” and a challenge to the \nexecution itself; (ii) the notion that Hill’s claim here, had it \nbeen  presented  in  a  habeas  petition,  could  have  been \nanything  but  “second  or  successive”;  and  (iii)  the \nsuggestion, which underlies Hill’s entire position, that, one \nway  or  another,  he  is  entitled  to  an  unencumbered \nopportunity  to  litigate  his  Eighth  Amendment  claim  in \nfederal district court. \nI.  David Larry Nelson:  The Rest of the Story \nWriting  for  30  States  in  Nelson,  the  State  of  Ohio \npredicted that if this Court were to allow the §1983 suit there \nto go forward, “it is reasonable to assume that virtually all \ndeath-sentenced  prisoners  will  be  citing  the  ‘Nelson \nexception’ as grounds for eleventh-hour stays.”  Br. of Ohio \nand 29 Other States at 15.  This case bears out that prophecy.  \nHill’s brief cites Nelson more than 50 times, says that the \n§1983 complaint here was “modeled on the one this Court \napproved” in Nelson (Hill Br. 2) and that this case “is on all \nfours  with”  Nelson  (Hill  Br.  13),  and  finally  asserts  that \nNelson “requires reversal of the Eleventh Circuit’s decision” \n(Hill Br. 12). \nIt is not so much the fact that Hill invokes Nelson, but \nrather the basis on which Hill invokes Nelson, that should \ninterest the Court.  Time and again, Hill insists that he is \nchallenging only “the particular procedures” that Florida \nintends to use to execute him, and he purports to “concede[] \nthat  other  methods  of  lethal  injection  the  [State]  could \n\n  5\nchoose to use would be constitutional.”  Hill Br. 17.  Thus, \nHill says, “[s]hould he prevail, the State would remain free \nto  carry  out  his  execution  using  more  humane  (and \nconstitutional) lethal injection procedures.”  Id. at 3; see also \nid. at 12 (execution may proceed by “different means”); id. at \n20-21 (same); id. at 22 (“different approach[]”).  \nThe “it’s-just-a-procedure” move is to be expected.  By so \npleading, Hill seeks to bring his claim in line with that of \nNelson,  who,  Hill  says,  also  “conceded  that  other \nprocedures for gaining [venous] access were constitutional.”  \nHill Br. 20.  Indeed, Nelson went so far as to suggest an \nalternative procedure that might be used to gain venous \naccess  in  lieu  of  the  challenged  “cut-down,”  namely, \n“percutaneous central line placement.”  J.A. 17 (Complaint \n¶63), Nelson (No. 03-6821).  That procedure, Nelson said in \nhis complaint, is “less invasive, less painful, faster, cheaper, \nand  safer”  than  the  cut-down  and,  further,  “meets  the \ncontemporary standards of medical care” and thus “does not \nviolate [Nelson’s] Eighth Amendment rights.”  Id. at 17, 19 \n(¶¶65, 68, 78).  Nelson made similar representations to this \nCourt.  Among them:  (i) that he was “not trying to block his \nexecution”1; (ii) that he did not “object to lethal injection” per \nse2; and (iii) that he had “no objection” to the percutaneous \ncentral  line  procedure.3    The  bottom  line,  according  to \nNelson,  was  that  if  the  State  would  “concede  that \npercutaneous  line  placement  would  be  an  acceptable \nmethod” of obtaining venous access, “then yes,” “[t]hat’s all \nwe were seeking.”4  Thus, Nelson asserted, “if, in the end, he is \npermitted to proceed in federal court and there obtains a \nfavorable  adjudication  of  his  Eighth  Amendment  claim” \nchallenging the cut-down procedure, “the immediate result \nwill be to let the State execute him and thus accomplish its \n—————— \n1 Oral Arg. Tr. 6. \n2 Id. at 18. \n3 Id. at 17. \n4 Id. at 60 (emphasis added). \n\n  6\nultimate objective as well.”  Br. for Petitioner, Nelson (No. 03-\n6821). \nNelson’s  concessions  were  central  to  this  Court’s \ndecision.  The Court emphasized that “[i]f as a factual matter \npetitioner were unable or unwilling to concede acceptable \nalternatives for gaining venous access, respondents might \nhave  a  stronger  argument  that  success  on  the  merits, \ncoupled with injunctive relief, would call into question the \ndeath sentence itself” and thus preclude §1983 review.  541 \nU.S. at 645.  As it was, though (or seemed, anyway), Nelson \nhad agreed to an alternative procedure – i.e., percutaneous \ncentral line placement – that, if used, would “allow[] the \nState to proceed with the execution ….”  Id. at 646.  Echoing \nthe  “necessar[y]  impl[ication]”  standard  of  Heck  v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), this Court held that because it \nwould not “necessarily prevent Alabama from carrying out \nits execution” by other means, Nelson’s challenge to the cut-\ndown could proceed under §1983.  514 U.S. at 647.  \nBut if ever a case proved the truth of Holmes’ dictum \nthat the life of the law is not logic (here, in the “necessar[y] \nimpl[ication]” sense) but experience,5 Nelson’s is it.  To its \ngreat consternation, the State of Alabama continues to this day \nto litigate Nelson’s §1983 action in district court.  Because the \npostscript to this Court’s decision in Nelson sheds important \nlight on the practicalities of the situation that Hill’s case \npresents  –  and  because  we  fear  that  Nelson’s  case  is \nindicative of a larger and growing trend – we relate Nelson’s \nstory here in some detail.  At the risk of killing the suspense, \nwe will summarize the storyline briefly up front.  Not to put \ntoo fine a point on it, Nelson’s lawyers (i) reneged on the \nvarious representations they had made to this Court, (ii) \nchallenged  as  “cruel  and  unusual”  the  very  execution \nprocedure  they  had  suggested  to  this  Court  as  a  viable \nalternative, and (iii) to this point, anyway, seem to have \n—————— \n5 See Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common Law 1 (1881). \n\n  7\ngotten away with it.  The tale of Nelson’s machinations and \nmanipulations is part tragedy, part farce. \nA.  A Cautionary Tale \nTrue to its word,6 the State of Alabama, on remand from \nthis Court’s decision, took the cut-down procedure off the \ntable as a means of gaining access to Nelson’s veins and \nagreed to proceed either on the basis of a simple peripheral \nneedle  stick  or,  failing  that,  according  to  Nelson’s  own \npreferred  method  –  percutaneous  central  line  placement.  \nThe  colloquy  that  occurred  during  an  initial  status \nconference  in  the  district  court  bears  repeating  at  some \nlength because it contains the seeds of the “mutation” of \nNelson’s  claim.    To  start,  the  district  court  judge  (Hon. \nMyron H. Thompson) asked counsel, “Can we all agree … \nthat the cutdown procedure will not be used?”  Three times \nthe State’s lawyer answered, “Yes, your Honor,” to which \nJudge Thompson responded:  “I’m ordering it today.  The \ncutdown  procedure  cannot  be  used  by  agreement  of  the \nparties.”7    Asked  then  by  Judge  Thompson,  “What \nprocedure  will  be  used?”  the  State  responded  that  “[a] \nperipheral vein will be accessed, and if that’s not successful \nthen  a  central  line  procedure  will  be  used.”8    With  that \nassurance – that the State intended to proceed according to \nNelson’s own chosen protocol – Judge Thompson inquired, \n“Isn’t  this  case  over  now?”    The  State,  not  surprisingly, \nanswered “Yes, sir.”9 \nNelson’s  lawyers  answered  “No.”10    When  Judge \nThompson asked “Why not?”  Nelson’s lawyers said that \n—————— \n6 Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646 (quoting State’s agreement that “’percutaneous \ncentral line placement is the preferred method’” and observing that “the \nState  now  seems  willing  to  implement  petitioner’s  proposed \nalternatives”). \n7 Hearing Tr. 6-7, Nelson v.

You said this was an option.  \nYou said it was one that you could live with.  Why \ndon’t we just reduce this to a court order?  This is \nyour protocol reduced to a court order.  That’s it.  What’s \nwrong with that?16 \nEven as Judge Thompson emphasized that “[e]veryone is \nagreed now” and that “[w]e’re agreeing with you around \nthe  board,”  Nelson’s  lawyers  reiterated  their  new \ndemands.17  Specifically, they said, they “want[ed] … a step-\n—————— \n11 Id. at 11. \n12 Oral Arg.

Notably, these new objections were based in large part on  \nNelson’s lawyers’ repeated representations to Judge Thompson that their \nown central-line protocol entailed “a surgical procedure.”  Id.; see also id. at \n8 (“[T]hat’s what it is, it’s surgery.”).  But that, too, contrasts starkly with \n \n\n  9\nby-step procedure.”18  Judge Thompson cut them off mid-\nsentence: \nBut if we do that, all you’re going to do is come \nback and say well, they didn’t tell us what step 2A \nwill be and what step 2B [will] be when we didn’t \nknow you needed step 2A and 2B. \nCough up now or shut up.  Now tell me now what \nit is that you want.  If you want to know who will do \nthe procedure, if you want to know how it will be \ndone, then ask for that now.19 \nNelson’s lawyers persisted:  “We want to know who is going \nto  do  it,  where  they’re  going  to  do  it,  and  what  their \nqualifications are.”20 \nWhen, in response, the State assured Judge Thompson \nthat “if a central line procedure is necessary, then a doctor, a \nmedical doctor is available to perform that procedure,” one \nof Nelson’s lawyers parried with yet another new objection:  \n“[J]ust a general M.D., as far as I know, is not adequate” \nbecause,  he  now  claimed,  “[p]ercutaneous  central  line \nplacement is a specialty … that lots of doctors have never \nperformed.”21    Thus,  he  said,  “If  it’s  somebody  who  is \nexperienced in subcutaneous placement, then that’s what we \n—————— \nwhat they told this Court.  Asked point blank by Justice O’Connor during \noral argument whether percutaneous central line placement “require[s] a \ncut as well,” Nelson’s lawyer answered:  “No, ma’am.  It … would just \nrequire … a needle, a hollow needle, with a wire inside. … It wouldn’t \nrequire the kind of incision and all of the kind of auxiliary support \nsystems.”  Oral Arg.

Again, inconsistencies abound:  In challenging the cut-\ndown and purporting to embrace central line placement, Nelson’s original \ncomplaint said of the latter procedure:  “Because of this procedure’s more \nwidespread  use,  more  physicians  are  proficient  and  competent  in \nperforming this procedure as compared to the cut-down procedure.”  J.A. \n17 (¶66), Nelson (No. 03-6821). \n\n  10\nwant.”22    Even  when  the  State  further  assured  Judge \nThompson  that  its  doctor  “is  experienced  at  performing \nprocedures  for  intravenous  access”  and  “has  performed \nmany central line procedures,” Nelson’s lawyers continued \nto dissemble.23  At that point, Judge Thompson, obviously \nand understandably frustrated, decided to refer the entire \nmatter to an independent medical expert.24  And at that point, \nof course, Nelson effectively won.  His lawyers had successfully \nmanaged  to  turn  the  case  on  its  head,  attack  their  own \nsuggested procedure  (the  very  procedure that this Court \nunderscored as the basis for its decision allowing the §1983 \nsuit to proceed), and delay indefinitely Nelson’s scheduled \nexecution. \nOn the heels of the status conference, the State moved to \ndismiss  Nelson’s  §1983  complaint.    In  short,  the  State \ncontended (i) that Nelson’s complaint challenged only one \nprocedure, the cut-down; (ii) that the State had expressly \nagreed  not  to  use  the  cut-down  and  to  proceed  instead \naccording to Nelson’s own chosen protocol, which called for \ngaining venous access using, if necessary, a percutaneous \ncentral  line  procedure;  and,  therefore,  (iii)  that  Nelson’s \nEighth  Amendment  claim  was  moot.    See  Motion  To \nDismiss, Nelson, No. 2:03-CV-1008-T (Oct. 29, 2004). \nSix  months  later,  Judge  Thompson  convened  another \nstatus  conference.    At  the  hearing,  the  State  objected  to \nfurther  proceedings  on  the  ground  that  Nelson  had  not \nresponded to, nor had Judge Thompson ruled on, the State’s \nmotion to dismiss.25  Judge Thompson responded that “the \nreason I set this procedure up” – that is, of referring the case \nto a medical expert – “was so that I could rule on” that \nmotion,  because  “I  didn’t  know  what  the  percutaneous \n—————— \n22 Id. at 17. \n23 Id. at 17-18. \n24 See id. at 19-20. \n25 Hearing Tr. 5, Nelson, No. 2:03-CV-1008-T (Apr. 12, 2005) \n\n  11\nsubclavian  central  line  procedure  is.”26    While \nacknowledging  that  it  “underst[ood  Judge  Thompson’s] \nposition,” the State said that it “would have to insist on a \nruling.”27  The reason, the State explained, was that Nelson’s \n§1983  complaint  “contains  allegations  about  just  one \nprocedure,  and  it’s  not  anything  about  a  central  line \nprocedure,  it’s  about  a  cutdown  procedure,”  which,  of \ncourse,  had  been  eliminated  as  a  possibility.    “[T]he \nlawsuit,” the State pointed out, “seems to be kind of taking \non new allegations.”28 \nOn the latter point, Judge Thompson agreed that “now \nthat I think about it, you may be correct.”  But instead of \ndismissing  Nelson’s  cut-down  based  complaint,  Judge \nThompson said that “[i]t may be that the plaintiff needs to \nfurther modify his complaint to make clear exactly what he’s \nalleging.”29  Nelson’s lawyers jumped at the chance.  They \nsaid that they would “certainly be happy to” amend the \ncomplaint to the challenge the central-line procedure, which \nthey subsequently did, thus formalizing their switcheroo.30 \nNelson’s amended complaint is astonishing – and eye-\nopening.  Its allegations challenging central line placement \n(again,  Nelson’s  own  chosen procedure)  echo, essentially \nverbatim, those that Nelson had earlier leveled at the cut-\ndown.  Indeed, Nelson’s amended complaint proceeds in \nlockstep  fashion  to  parrot  the  allegations  of  the  initial \ncomplaint – only training them on the central line procedure \n– for twenty straight paragraphs.  We have attached a revealing \nblow-by-blow comparison of the two as an appendix to this \nbrief.  But there are two highlights worth mentioning here \nbecause  they  so  clearly  unmask  Nelson’s  lawyers’ \nmaneuvering  and  point  up  the  problem  with  death-row \n—————— \n26 Id. \n27 Id. at 5-6. \n28 Id. at 6. \n29 Id. \n30 Id. at 9. \n\n  12\ninmates’  now-standard  “it’s-just-a-procedure”  line.    First, \nNelson’s amended complaint asserts that precisely the same \ncomplications would attend the use of percutaneous central \nline placement as would (his original complaint said) have \naccompanied  the  cut-down.    In  fact,  the  two  complaints \ndescribe the supposed complications in identical terms: \nThese complications include the very painful and \nlife-threatening  conditions  of  severe  hemorrhage \n(with  accompanying  sense  of  asphyxiation  and \nterror),  pneumothorax  (with  accompanying  severe \ndistress,  sense  of  suffocation  and  potential \ncardiovascular  collapse),  and  cardiac  dysrhythmia \n(abnormal electrical activity in the heart leading to \nshock with accompanying severe chest pain, nausea, \nvomiting, and sense of suffocation or asphyxia). \nJ.A.  14  (¶49),  Nelson  (No.  03-6821)  (cut-down);  Second \nAmended Complaint ¶112, Nelson, No. 2:03-CV-1008-T (Apr. \n22,  2005)  (percutaneous  central  line  placement).    It  is  of \ncourse  inconceivable  that  the  two  procedures  –  the  cut-\ndown, on the one hand, and Nelson’s own percutaneous \ncentral line placement, on the other – could actually risk \nexactly  the  same  complications.    Nelson’s  lawyers  were \nsimply saying what they needed to say – and being none too \ncoy about it – to keep the case alive and to keep Nelson’s \nexecution from going forward. \n  There is a second revealing juxtaposition.  Paragraph \n125 of Nelson’s amended complaint (attacking the central \nline procedure) asserts that “[i]f the risks of inflicting pain \nand suffering associated with execution by lethal injection in \nthe Plaintiff’s case may be easily remedied or mitigated by \nemploying adequate safeguards, the Defendants’ failure to take \nthese steps violates the Plaintiff’s rights under the United \nStates Constitution.”  Id. ¶125 (emphasis added).  In his \noriginal  complaint,  Nelson  had  made  exactly  the  same \nallegation, but with an important twist:  “If the risks of \ninflicting pain and suffering associated with execution by \nlethal injection in the Plaintiff’s case may be easily remedied \n\n  13\nor mitigated by employing alternative methods or altering the \nprocedures employed in the execution process, the Defendants’ \nfailure to take these steps violates the Plaintiff’s rights under \nthe United States Constitution.”  J.A. 16 (¶61), Nelson (No. \n03-6821) (emphasis added).  The “alternative method[]” or \n“alter[ed] procedure[]” to which Nelson’s original complaint \nreferred  was  –  of  course  –  percutaneous  central  line \nplacement.  Indeed, Nelson’s original complaint spent the \nnext six paragraphs extolling the virtues of that procedure, \nconcluding with the statement that percutaneous central line \nplacement “meets contemporary standards of medical care.”  \nId. at 17 (¶¶62-67).  Despite the otherwise perfect parallelism \nbetween  the  original  and  amended  complaints,  those  six \nparagraphs  are  conspicuously  absent  from  the  amended \nversion.  See Second Amended Complaint, Nelson, No. 2:03-\nCV-1008-T (gap between ¶¶125 and 126).  The reason, of \ncourse, is that the original complaint endorsed percutaneous \ncentral  line  placement  as  an  humane  alternative;  the \namended complaint attacks that same procedure as “cruel \nand unusual.”  \nThe State promptly moved to dismiss Nelson’s amended \ncomplaint,  pointing out not only the obvious – that Nelson \nwas now challenging as unconstitutional the very procedure \nthat he had earlier touted as an acceptable alternative – but \nalso that he was challenging central line placement on the \nvery same grounds that he had challenged the cut-down.  See \nMotion To Dismiss Second Amended Complaint at 5, Nelson, \nNo.  2:03-CV-1008-T  (May  4,  2005).    Regrettably,  given \nNelson’s lawyers’ baiting and switching, the State was left to \ndraw  only  one  conclusion:    “that  Nelson’s  previous \nrepresentations to [the district court], the Eleventh Circuit, \nand  the  Supreme  Court  were  a  ruse  and  that  Nelson’s \nattorneys’ sole motivation is to delay or stop the State from \ncarrying out Nelson’s lawfully imposed death sentence.”  Id. \nat 7.  “As it turns out,” the State observed, Nelson’s §1983 \nsuit “is, as the State has said all along, a challenge to [his] \ndeath sentence itself.”  Id. at 7-8. \n\n  14\nTwo years after this Court’s decision in Nelson, which by \nall accounts should have brought about a speedy resolution \nof  the  litigation,  the  State’s  motion  to  dismiss  remains \npending in district court. \nB.  The Takeaway \n1.  So what’s the moral to the story?  Not that Nelson’s \nlawyers are bad people; they have a client to defend, and \nthey are defending him.  The moral, instead, is simply that \nin the hurly burly of capital litigation – where claims mutate \nand  targets  move  –  logical  postulates  (e.g.,  that  X \n“necessarily impl[ies]” Y) often don’t do the trick.  The fact \nthat a particular execution-related challenge – like Nelson’s \nor Hill’s – might, in some theoretical sense, be separable \nfrom the execution itself simply cannot be the test of §1983’s \napplicability.    As  Nelson’s  case  demonstrates,  there  can \nalways be – and often will be – new challenges to new \nexecution “procedures.”  The hydraulic pressure to muster \nand  mount  such  challenges  is  overwhelming.    And,  of \ncourse, the nature and variability of those challenges are \nlimited only by a condemned inmate’s lawyer’s imagination.  \nIf it’s not the cut-down, it’s the central line.  If it’s not this \ncombination of chemicals, it’s that combination.  Or perhaps \nit’s the length or width of the needle, the particular area of \nthe  body  into  which  the  State  proposes  to  insert  that \nneedle,31  the  type  of  restraints  on  the  gurney,  or  the \nqualifications of the attending medical personnel.32  We are \n—————— \n31 See, e.g., Hill Br. 7 (citing Baze v. Rees, No. 04-CI-01094 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July \n8, 2005), pending on appeal, Rees v. Baze, No. 2005-SC-000543 (Ky. Sup. Ct.), \nas holding unconstitutional “lethal injection into the jugular vein of the \nneck of the condemned prisoner”); Taylor v. Crawford, No. 05-4173-CV-C-\nFJG, at 6 (W. D. Mo. Jan. 31, 2006) (challenge to use of femoral artery). \n32 As shown by recent events in California, by demanding that a doctor be \npresent, a death-sentenced inmate can effectively forestall his execution.  \nSee, e.g., Louis Sahagun & Henry Weinstein, California Calls Off Execution, \nL.A. Times (Feb. 22, 2006); see also, e.g., Taylor, No. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG, at 7 \n(inmate insisting that doctor be present and then asserting that no doctor \ncan ethically participate). \n\n  15\nnot  being  flippant  or  crass.    Our  point  is  that  a  death-\nsentenced inmate has every incentive – however natural that \nincentive  may  be  –  to  delay  his  execution  by  whatever \nmeans necessary.  The law, if it is to have any footing in \nreality, must take account of that fact. \nAlong these lines, it is important to point out that the \nline  drawn  in  Nelson  between  “wholly  unnecessary”  or \n“gratuitous” execution procedures, on the one hand, and \n“necessary” ones, on the other – the former, but probably \nnot  the  latter,  being  challengeable  under  §1983  –  does \nnothing to ameliorate the problem.  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 645-\n46.  The reason, of course, is that there is no such thing as a \nstrictly,  technically,  scientifically  necessary  execution \nprocedure.  There is, to be blunt, always some other way to \ncarry out the execution.  In Nelson, a cut-down was deemed \nunnecessary  because  other  methods  of  obtaining  venous \naccess – among them, percutaneous central line placement – \nwere available.  But just as surely, percutaneous central line \nplacement is not technically necessary to accomplishing a \nlethal  injection;  there  are  any  number  of  other  ways  by \nwhich venous access can theoretically be established, even \nfor an inmate, like Nelson, with compromised veins.   \nSo,  too,  here.    No  particular  cocktail  of  chemicals  is \nstrictly  necessary  to  a  lethal  injection  –  as  indicated,  for \nstarters,  by  the  fact  that  different  States  use  different \ncocktails.  The number of available chemical-composition \nvariations  –  not  only  the  use  of  different  doses  of  the \ntraditional drugs sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, \nand potassium chloride, but also the use of entirely different \ndrugs (e.g., morphine) – is literally infinite.  There is, as best \nwe can tell, no limiting principle to an “unnecessary-ness” \ncriterion.  Of course, we don’t point all of this out for the \npurpose of advocating that all chemical-composition (and, \nfor that matter, all other execution-related) challenges be \nswept into the rule articulated in Nelson.  Quite the contrary, \nwe urge the Court to take notice of the real-world facts (i) \nthat  technically  unnecessary  execution  “procedures”  are \ninnumerable and (ii) that a death-sentenced inmate can stop \n\n  16\nan  execution  just  as  surely  by  challenging  an  execution \n“procedure” as by challenging the fact of his conviction or \nsentence itself. \n2.  In any event, if ever there was a challenge to an \nexecution “procedure” so bound up with a challenge to the \nsentence itself as to be indistinguishable, this is it.  Nelson, \nadmittedly, involved a procedure (the cut-down) that was \none small step removed from the administration of the lethal \ninjection itself.  Here, by contrast, the challenge is to the very \nsubstances  that  constitute  that  injection.    Under  Heck  v. \nHumphrey and its progeny, Hill’s claim may not proceed \nunder §1983. \nThis  Court  has  made  clear  that  Heck’s  “necessar[y] \nimpl[ication]” standard should be applied functionally, not \nformalistically.  In Heck itself, the Court characterized its \nholding  as  reaching  beyond  claims  of  “unconstitutional \nconviction  or  imprisonment”  to  encompass,  as  well, \nallegations  of  “other  harm  caused  by  actions  whose \nunlawfulness  would  render  a  conviction  or  sentence \ninvalid.”  512 U.S. at 486-87.  The Court thus clarified that \nHeck’s  limitations  on  §1983  actions  extend  beyond \nunvarnished, frontal assaults on convictions and sentences \nper se.  Rather, those limitations apply as well – as they must \nin  the  real  world  –  to  claims  that,  though  perhaps  not \n“directly attributable” to a conviction or sentence, see id. at \n487  n.6  nonetheless  necessarily  affect  the  conviction’s  or \nsentence’s validity. \nIn Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997), this Court’s \nemphasis on functional reasoning was even more apparent.  \nThere, the Court pointed to Heck’s “other harm” language in \nexpressly embracing a practical, functional approach to the \nquestion whether a given §1983 claim “necessarily impl[ies]” \nthe invalidity of a conviction or sentence.  Balisok had filed a \n§1983 action alleging that the procedures utilized in a prison \ndisciplinary hearing at which he was deprived of good-time \ncredits violated due process.  Like Hill here, Balisok insisted \nthat his challenge was concerned solely with “procedures,” \nand not with his ultimate sentence or punishment.  See, e.g., \n\n  17\nBr. for Resp. at 6, 7, 8, 16, Balisok (No. 95-1352).  As this Court \nsummarized Balisok’s claim, it “posited that the procedures \nwere wrong, but not necessarily that the result was.”  520 \nU.S. at 645.  The Ninth Circuit had adopted a formalistic rule \nthat  a  claim  challenging  procedures  would  never \n“necessarily  imply”  a  punishment’s  invalidity  within  the \nmeaning of Heck and thus was “always cognizable under \n§1983.”  Id. at 644. \nIn reversing, this Court unanimously rejected the Ninth \nCircuit’s  bright-line  rule  sanctioning  all  §1983-based \nchallenges  to  disciplinary-hearing  “procedures.”    Instead, \nthe Balisok Court concluded that while some challenges to \nprocedures will not run afoul of Heck, others certainly will.  \nThat determination, this Court emphasized, will depend on \n“the nature of the challenge to the procedures” and whether, \nin a particular case, the procedural challenge is “such as \nnecessarily to imply the invalidity of the judgment.”  Id. at \n645.  And, indeed, this Court held that several of Balisok’s \nchallenges,  although  ostensibly  aimed  solely  at  the \nprocedures employed, not at the punishment imposed, did \n“necessarily imply” the invalidity of his punishment within \nthe  meaning  of  Heck,  and  were  therefore  not  cognizable \nunder §1983. \nBalisok’s  functional  reasoning  applies  precisely to  this \ncase.  Like Balisok, Hill insists that he is not attacking his \ndeath  sentence  per  se,  but  is  instead  challenging  only  a \n“procedure”  used  to  administer  that  sentence.    That \nprocedural challenge, he says, may proceed under §1983, \nwithout  regard  to  the  rules  governing  habeas  corpus \npractice.  What Hill apparently seeks in this case is a Ninth-\nCircuit-like  rule  that  a  challenge  to  an  execution \n“procedure”  can  never  amount  to  a  challenge  to  the \nexecution  itself.    But  that  is  just  the  sort  of  wooden \nformalism that this Court rejected in Balisok.  It is the “nature \nof  [Hill’s  specific]  challenge,”  id.  at  645,  that  determines \nwhether  his  §1983  claim  is  foreclosed  by  Heck.    Viewed \nfunctionally, as Balisok shows it should be, it is clear that \nHill’s claim is barred.  Just as Balisok demonstrates that the \n\n  18\nlegal relationship between a particular “procedure” and a \nsentence  can  be  such  that  a  challenge  to  the  former  is \ntantamount to a challenge to the latter, so, too, the factual \nrelationship  between  the  three-chemical  “procedure”  that \nHill attacks (Hill Br. 6) and his death sentence – the former \nbeing  the  very  substance  of  the  latter  –  exposes  Hill’s \nchallenge as one directed to his sentence. \nII.  Hill’s Challenge, If Presented in a Habeas Petition, \nWould Be Barred as “Second or Successive” Under \nAEDPA. \nHill  contends  that  even  if  his  §1983  complaint  were \nrecharacterized as a habeas corpus petition, it would not be \nsubject to dismissal under 28 U.S.C. §2244(b) as “second or \nsuccessive” – even though, he freely admits, he has already \nlitigated one habeas petition to conclusion.  See Hill Br. 29-\n36.  We respectfully disagree. \nFirst, a bit of background.  As this Court has observed, \n“Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution \nof state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital \ncases.”    Woodford  v.  Garceau,  538  U.S.  202,  206  (2003) \n(emphasis added).  Specifically, Congress sought “to curb \nthe  abuse  of  the  statutory  writ  of  habeas  corpus”  and, \nthereby,  to  “address  the  acute  problems  of  unnecessary \ndelay and abuse in capital cases.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-\n518, at 111 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 944, 944.  In \nsigning AEDPA, President Clinton lamented that “[f]or too \nlong, and in too many cases, endless death row appeals have \nstood in the way of justice being served.”  Statement on \nSigning the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996, 32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 719, 720 (Apr. 24, 1996).  \nThe  point  of  AEDPA,  the  President  emphasized,  was  to \n“streamline  Federal  appeals  for  convicted  criminals \nsentenced to the death penalty.”  Id. \nOne of the principal means by which Congress sought to \n“streamline” the appeals process was by severely restricting \ninmates’  ability  to  file  “second  or  successive”  habeas \npetitions.  28 U.S.C. §2244(b).  Section 2244(b)(1) requires \n\n  19\ndismissal, without exception, of any claim raised in a second \nor  successive  petition  that  “was  presented  in  a  prior \napplication.”    With  respect  to  so-called  “new  claim” \npetitions – second or successive petitions raising claims, like \nHill’s  Eighth  Amendment  claim  here,  that  were  “not \npresented in a previous application” – §2244(b)(2) requires \ndismissal save in two narrow circumstances.  Specifically, \nCongress determined that an inmate may file a new-claim \nsuccessive petition only: \n• \nwhere  the  claim  “relies  on  a  new  rule  of \nconstitutional law, made retroactive to cases on \ncollateral review by the Supreme Court, that was \npreviously unavailable” (§2244(b)(2)(A)); or \n• \nwhere both (i) the “factual predicate for the claim \ncould  not  have  been  discovered  previously \nthrough the exercise of due diligence” and (ii) the \nfacts underlying the claim establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the inmate is actually \ninnocent (§2244(b)(2)(B)). \nHill  claims  here  that  he  should  not  be  subject  to \n§2244(b)(2)’s bar because his Eighth Amendment claim – \nchallenging the administration of Florida’s lethal-injection \nstatute, which was not enacted until January 14, 2000 – was \n“unripe” and “had no factual or legal predicate” at the time \nhe was litigating his first habeas petition.  Hill Br. 34; see also \nid. at 13 (same).33  To be clear, Hill does not now contend that \nhe qualifies under §2244(b)(2)(B)’s exception for claims that \nrest  on  a  “factual  predicate”  that  “could  not  have  been \ndiscovered  previously  through  the  exercise  of  due \ndiligence.”  And with good reason; in addition to requiring a \npreviously  unavailable  “factual  predicate,”  §2244(b)(2)(B) \nrequires a petitioner to show that his claim implicates his \n—————— \n33 This Court denied certiorari respecting the Eleventh Circuit’s affirmance \nof the district court’s denial of Hill’s habeas petition on January 10, 2000.  \nSee Hill v.

Instead,  Hill  contends  that  because  the \n“predicate” for his claim was unavailable to him when he \nlitigated his first habeas petition, his current claim is not \n“second or successive” at all.   \nThere is, respectfully, a fundamental problem with Hill’s \nargument:  Although it purports to deal only with §2244(b)’s \n“second or successive” triggering condition and not with the \noperation of the statutory exceptions, it nonetheless ends up \nreading §2244(b)(2)(B)’s express actual-innocence limitation \nright out of the statute.  The statute, to repeat, says that a \npetitioner  may  raise  a  claim  based  on  a  new  “factual \npredicate”  if,  but  only  if,  he  can  also  make  a  clear  and \nconvincing showing of actual innocence.  Hill says, quite \ndifferently, that a petitioner ought to be able to raise a claim \nbased on a new predicate simply because of the claim’s newness \n– wholly without regard to the claim’s relationship to the \npetitioner’s  innocence.    Under  any  fair  reading  of \n§2244(b)(2)(B), that cannot be. \nWithout  coming  right  out  and  acknowledging  the \nproblem,  Hill  offers  several  solutions  to  it.    None  is \npersuasive. \n1.  It is not true, as Hill suggests (Hill Br. 33-35), that \nbecause his challenge might not have constituted an “abuse \nof the writ” under pre-AEDPA law, it cannot be deemed \n“second or successive” within the meaning of §2244(b)(2)(B).  \nIn essence, Hill’s contention here is that AEDPA was just a \nblip  –  that  Congress  was  satisfied  with  existing  habeas \npractice and content simply to codify business as usual.  But \nthat  is  not  so.    In  support  of  this  what’s-old-is-new \ninterpretation,  Hill  quotes  Felker  v.  Turpin,  518  U.S.  651 \n(1996), for the proposition that “[t]he new restrictions on \nsuccessive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a \nrestraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice ‘abuse \nof the writ.’”  Hill Br. 33.  But that passage merely indicates \nthat §2244(b) is aimed, generally, at the same sort of problem \n– repetitive filings – targeted by the old abuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine.  It does not suggest that what constitutes abuse, or \n\n  21\nthat the response to abusiveness, is the same now as before \nAEDPA.  And, indeed, other language in Felker – found just \nbefore and just after the quote that Hill excerpts – makes \nclear that in enacting AEDPA Congress was not just treading \nwater.  This Court specifically referred there to “[t]he added \nrestrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions” \nand observed that while AEDPA “codifies some of the pre-\nexisting  limits  on  successive  petitions,”  it  also  “further \nrestricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners.”  518 \nU.S. at 664 (emphasis added); see also See Henry Hart & \nHerbert Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System \n1386 (Richard Fallon, et al., eds., 5th ed. 2003) (“In 1996, \nCongress amended §2244(b) to further restrict federal court \npower to entertain successive petitions.”). \nOne  of  the  country’s  leading  death-penalty  lawyers \naccurately  summed  up  these  “added”  and  “further” \nrestrictions imposed by AEDPA’s stringent second-petitions \nbar like this:  “As a general matter” in the pre-AEDPA days, \n“any type of claim that was unavailable at the time of the \nearlier filing – because the legal or factual basis for that claim \ndid  not  exist  or  was  not  reasonably  knowable  by  the \nprisoner – was an appropriate candidate for inclusion in a \nsuccessive petition.”  Bryan Stevenson, The Politics of Fear and \nDeath: Successive Problems in  Capital Federal Habeas Corpus \nCases,  77  N.Y.U.  L.  Rev.  699,  736  (2002).    “AEDPA’s \nsuccessive  petition  standard,”  he  explained,  “appears  to \nincorporate  this  general  approach,  but  with  one  major \ndifference.”  Id. at 737 (emphasis added).  Specifically, and as \nparticularly  relevant  here,  “Subsection  2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) \nsharply diverges from [the] prior law … by modifying the \n‘new facts’ category to include an additional requirement \nthat the prisoner make a showing of ‘innocence.’”  Id. at 737-\n38. \nIn other words, before AEDPA’s enactment, a new claim \ncould be presented in a second petition on a showing either \n(i) that cause existed to excuse the failure to present the \nclaim earlier – for instance, the “unavailability of the factual \nbasis for the claim” at the time the first petition was filed – or \n\n  22\n(ii)  that  the  petitioner  was  likely  to  be  “innocent  of  the \ncrime.”  McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 494-95, 497 (1991); \nsee  also  2  Randy  Hertz  &  James  Leibman, Federal  Habeas \nCorpus Practice and Procedure §28.3e, at 1454 (5th ed. 2005) \n(“proof  of  either  ‘cause  and  prejudice’  or  an  innocence-\nfocused variety of ‘manifest miscarriage of justice’”).  New \n§2244(b)(2)(B), by contrast, expressly tightens the second-\npetition standard by requiring a habeas petitioner to show \nboth (i) a newly-discovered factual predicate and (ii) probable \nactual innocence.  See id (explaining AEDPA’s shift from a \ndisjunctive  cause-or-innocence  standard  to  a  conjunctive \n“cause and innocence” standard); Hart & Wechsler, supra, at \n1386 (AEDPA “narrows the prior standards” by requiring \nthat a second petition “satisfy both of two conditions (under \nMcCleskey, they were essentially alternatives”)). \nNo one, to our knowledge, has ever suggested that this \nconspicuous shift from an “either-or” standard to a “both-\nand” standard was the result of oversight.  And, indeed, \ngiven all of the clamor about “reduc[ing] delays,” “curb[ing] \n…  abuse,”  and  “streamlin[ing]  …  appeals”  that \naccompanied AEDPA’s passage (see supra at 18), it seems \ninconceivable  that  §2244(b)(2)  is  anything  less  than \nCongress’ conscious design to punch-up the old abuse-of-\nthe-writ doctrine and tighten the second-petition standards.  \nAccordingly,  the  argument  that  underlies  Hill’s  position \nhere – that Congress could not possibly have intended to \npreclude second habeas petitions that raise new claims that, \nthough  not  implicating  actual  innocence,  are  based  on  a \nfactual or legal predicate not available at the time the first \nhabeas  petition  was  adjudicated  –  provokes  a \nstraightforward response:  That is precisely what Congress \nintended, and it is virtually impossible to read §2244(b)(2) – \nparticularly in the light the clear rejection of business as \nusual – any other way. \nWe should add that Congress’ determination to limit \n§2244(b)(2)(B)’s reach to claims that (unlike Hill’s) implicate \nan inmate’s actual innocence is not only crystal clear, but \nalso  eminently  reasonable.    It  appropriately  tempers  the \n\n  23\ntraditional  habeas  concerns  of  federalism,  comity,  and \nfinality  with  a  heightened  solicitude  for  one  uniquely \ncompelling  circumstance:  an  inmate’s showing  that he  is \nactually, factually innocent – i.e., that he didn’t do it.  See \nCalderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 558 (1998) (“AEDPA’s \ncentral concern” is “that the merits of concluded criminal \nproceedings  not  be  revisited  in  the  absence  of  a  strong \nshowing of actual innocence.”); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, \n324-25 (1995) (“[T]he individual interest in avoiding injustice \nis most compelling in the context of actual innocence.”). \nIn Lonchar v. Thomas, this Court emphasized that , when \nit  comes  to  prescribing  the  appropriate  scope  of  habeas \ncorpus,  “balanc[ing]  the  relevant  competing  interests”  is \nprimarily a task for Congress, not the courts.  517 U.S. 314, \n328 (1996).  By enacting AEDPA – which, as relevant here, \namends §2244(b)(2) – Congress struck a new and different \n“balance” concerning repetitive petitions.  There is no basis \nfor upsetting that balance now. \n2.  Contrary to Hill’s suggestions (Hill Br. 29-33), neither \nStewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637 (1998), nor Slack v. \nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473 (2000), salvages his counter-textual \nargument.    At  issue  in  Martinez-Villareal  was  a  habeas \npetition  presenting  a  “competency-to-be-executed”  claim \nunder  Ford  v.  Wainwright,  477  U.S.  399  (1986).    The \ncondemned  inmate  had  raised  his  Ford  claim  in  a  prior \nhabeas petition, but the district court had “dismissed [the \nclaim]  as  premature  …  because  his  execution  was  not \nimminent and therefore his competence to be executed could \nnot be determined at that time.”  Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. \nat  644-45.    After  the  State  had  obtained  an  execution \nwarrant, the inmate moved the district court to reopen his \nearlier-filed  Ford  claim.    Based  on  AEDPA’s  successive-\npetitions bar, the district court refused.  The Ninth Circuit \nreversed,  seemingly  on  the  broad  ground  that  because, \nalmost by definition, a Ford claim will not arise until after \nthe  first  round  of  habeas  litigation, AEDPA’s successive-\npetitions bar “does not apply to a petition that raises only a \n\n  24\ncompetency  to  be  executed  claim.”    Martinez-Villareal  v. \nStewart, 118 F.3d 628, 629 (9th Cir. 1997). \nThis Court affirmed but “on a much narrower ground \nthan the appellate court had employed.”  Stevenson, supra, \nat 744.  Whereas “the Ninth Circuit [had] essentially read \ninto the statute an exemption for Ford claims,” this Court \n“avoided deciding the broad issues in the case.”  Id. at 742, \n747.  This Court held only that the inmate there had not filed \na “second or successive” habeas petition at all but, instead, \nhad simply moved to reopen his first petition.  See Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. at 643 (“There was only one application for \nhabeas relief ….”).  The Court concluded that in that unique \nsituation, where a habeas petitioner moves to reopen an \nearlier-filed petition to obtain an initial merits determination \nof a previously-unripe claim, AEDPA poses no bar.  The \nCourt expressly did not adopt a broad-ranging exception to \n§2244(b)(2)’s successive-petitions bar for all claims that, for \nwhatever  reason,  could  not  have  been  raised  in  a  first \npetition.  See id. at 645 n.*.  \nNeither Martinez-Villareal nor its successor, Slack, can be \nstretched to encompass Hill’s case.  Again, the numerically \nsecond  petition  in  Martinez-Villareal  was  deemed  a  first \npetition because the petitioner there had moved to reopen a \npreviously-filed  claim.    In  Slack,  a  numerically  second \npetition was deemed a first only because the actual first \npetition had been dismissed on exhaustion grounds and, \nthus, could be treated “as though it had not been filed.”   529 \nU.S. at 488.  Neither special circumstance applies here.  Hill \nis not moving to reopen an earlier-filed claim; and because \nhis first petition was denied on the merits, not for failure to \nexhaust or for some other technical deficiency, it cannot be \ndeemed  a  non-event.    There  simply  is  no  amount  of \nmassaging that could make Hill’s challenge anything other \nthan “second or successive.”   \nSome  have  argued  that  this  Court’s  decisions  in \nMartinez-Villareal and Slack themselves so narrowly construe \nAEDPA’s second-petition provisions as to “deviat[e] from \nstatute’s plain language.”  Hertz & Leibman, supra, §28.3e, at \n\n  25\n1463.    We    needn’t  go  so  far  today.    By  training  very \nspecifically  on  the  unique  procedural  circumstances \npresented in those cases, this Court was, at least arguably, \nable to permit the claims there to go forward and still remain \nfaithful to §2244(b)(2)’s text.  But there should be no mistake:  \nThe much broader proposition urged by Hill in this case – \nthat an inmate may file a second petition based solely on a \nnew claim’s newness, and even where his first petition was \nadjudicated on the merits – is irreconcilable with any fair \nreading of the statutory language.  Even, that is, if Martinez-\nVillareal and Slack didn’t break the camel’s back, acceptance \nof Hill’s more sweeping argument would. \n3.  Finally, and importantly, it is no answer to say that \nthere may be a difference, for §2244(b)(2) purposes, between \n(i)  a  claim  whose  factual  predicate  existed  but  was \nunavailable at the time the first habeas petition was litigated \nand (ii) a claim whose factual predicate simply did not exist \nat the time the first habeas petition was litigated.  Hill’s \nclaim, we acknowledge, is of the second variety, given that \nFlorida did not adopt lethal injection as its principal method \nof execution until shortly after Hill’s first habeas petition \nwas finally adjudicated.  But under AEDPA (and the history \nthat  led  to  that  statute’s  adoption)  the  distinction  is \nimmaterial. \nHill has not made it, but one could imagine an argument  \npositing that claims in the former category cannot proceed \nabsent  a  showing  of  innocence  in  compliance  with \n§2244(b)(2)(B),  while  claims  in  the  latter  are  free  of  the \nstatute’s innocence limitation.  But that argument cannot be \nsquared  either  with  AEDPA’s  plain  language,  with  pre-\nAEDPA abuse-of-the-write doctrine, or with common sense.  \nAs for text, §2244(b)(2)(B) is written broadly and generically \nto  require  a  habeas  petitioner  to  demonstrate  innocence \nwhenever he raises any claim whose “factual predicate … \ncould  not  have  been  discovered  previously  through  the \nexercise of due diligence.”  That language clearly reaches \nboth categories of claims described above; whether a claim’s \nfactual  predicate  was  existent  but  unavailable  or  simply \n\n  26\nnon-existent, it is one that “could not have been discovered \npreviously through the exercise of due diligence.”  There is \nno basis for reading the statutory language to apply only to \nthe first category. \nWhat is more, §2244(b)(2)(B)’s language – covering any \nclaim  whose  “factual  predicate  …  could  not  have  been \ndiscovered previously through the exercise of due diligence” \n– fairly and accurately describes this Court’s pre-AEDPA \nabuse-of-the-writ jurisprudence.  In McCleskey v. Zant, this \nCourt variously described the instances in which a habeas \npetitioner would not be found to have abused the writ in a \nsecond petition:  where he had a “legitimate excuse”; where \nhe “could not comply” with the requirement that he plead \nclaims in a first petition; where “‘the factual or legal basis for \na  claim  was  not  reasonably  available  to  counsel’”;  and, \nsimilarly,  where  “the  factual  basis  for  the  claim”  was \n“unavailab[le].”  499 U.S. at 490, 493, 494, 497.  All of those \ngeneric descriptions apply equally to claims whose factual \npredicates were (i) existent but unavailable and (ii) simply \nnon-existent.  See also Stevenson, supra, at 736 (under pre-\nAEDPA law “any type of claim that was unavailable at the \ntime of the earlier filing – because the legal or factual basis for \nthat claim did not exist or was not reasonably knowable by the \nprisoner – was an appropriate candidate for inclusion in a \nsuccessive  petition”  (emphasis  added)).    By  employing \ngeneric language – “factual predicate for the claim could not \nhave been discovered through the exercise of due diligence” \n– Congress in AEDPA clearly adverted to pre-1996 practice \nand refused to distinguish between the two scenarios.  It \nthen (and this is the key) coupled that generic basis for a \nsecond  petition  with  a  requirement  –  applicable  to  both \ncategories of claims – that a petitioner establish innocence \nbefore proceeding. \nFinally, there is no good reason to think that Congress \nwould have wanted to treat the two categories of claims \ndifferently.  There is no functional difference between them.  \nWhether  a  claim’s  factual  predicate  existed  but  was \nunavailable or simply didn’t exist at the time the first habeas \n\n  27\nwas  litigated,  the  point  is  that  the  petitioner  cannot  be \nfaulted for not presenting the claim earlier.  The equities are \nthe same in both instances.  If a claim’s factual predicate \nexisted  but  was  nonetheless  unavailable,  such  that  there \nwould  have  been  “cause”  under  McCleskey  for  failure  to \npresent it, it is, as a legal matter, as if the factual predicate \ndid not exist at all.  What possible basis could there be for \nletting  a  petitioner  whose  claim  did  not  exist  proceed \nwithout meeting §2244(b)(2)(B)’s innocence limitation, while \nrequiring a petitioner who technically had a claim but who \nhad absolutely no reasonable way of knowing about it to show \ninnocence  before  proceeding?    The  two  petitioners  are \nidentically situated, and what’s good for the goose (no one \ncould  dispute  that  §2244(b)(2)(B)’s  innocence  limitation \napplies  to  petitioners  whose  claims  rest  on  existent-but-\nunavailable factual predicates) is good for the gander.  As it \nshould have, Congress treated them together using generic \nlanguage that covered both situations – and required them \nboth  to  show  innocence  before  filing  a  new-facts-based \nsecond petition. \nHill’s position invites the Court to ignore the balance \nthat  Congress  struck  and  to  re-write  §2244(b)(2)’s  plain \nlanguage.  The Court should decline to do so.   \nIII.  Hill Has No Absolute Right To Litigate His Eighth \nAmendment Claim in Federal District Court. \nUnderlying Hill’s entire argument in this Court is the \nassertion that he is entitled – one way or another – to have \nhis Eighth Amendment claim adjudicated specifically by a \nfederal court.  If not on federal habeas, then in §1983; if not in \n§1983, then on federal habeas.  See Hill Br. 2 (“This case \npresents the question whether there is any federal forum \n….”);  id.  (“The  Eleventh  Circuit  below  …  has  wholly \nforeclosed access to the federal courts ….”); id. (“Mr. Hill has \nbeen  denied  any  federal  forum  ….”);  id.  at  12  (“[T]he \nEleventh Circuit denied Mr. Hill any federal forum ….”); id. \nat 15 (“[U]nder the law of the Eleventh Circuit, no federal \ncourt  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  his \n\n  28\nclaim.”); id. at 16 (“[The] Eleventh Circuit ruling … denied \nthe petitioner any federal forum ….”).   \nNotably,  Hill  does  not  claim  here  that  he  has  been \ndenied any remedy at all.  And with good reason.  Before \nfiling  the  present  §1983  suit,  Hill  filed  in  state  court  a \nsuccessive motion for postconviction relief.  Although the \ntrial court rejected Hill’s Eighth Amendment claim without \nholding an evidentiary hearing, the Florida Supreme Court \naddressed  Hill’s  contentions  on  the  merits  and  in  some \ndetail.  Specifically, that court observed that it had held in \n2000  that  “‘the  procedures  for  administering  the  lethal \ninjection [in Florida] do not violate the Eighth Amendment’s \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.’”  Hill v. \nState, No. SC06-2, 2006 WL 91302, at *2 (Fla. Jan. 17, 2006) \n(quoting Sims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 668 (Fla. 2000)).  The \ncourt acknowledged that Hill had come forward with new \nevidence bearing on the constitutional question – namely, (i) \nan April 2005 article published in the medical journal The \nLancet and (ii) an affidavit from one of the Lancet study’s \nauthors.    See  id.  at  *1.    After  reviewing  the  study  and \naffidavit,  however,  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  held  that \nthose sources did not “call into question [the earlier] holding \nin Sims.”  Id. at *2.  In so holding, the court emphasized, \namong other things, that the study (i) used data only from \nother  States,  not  Florida;  (ii)  is,  by  its  own  admission, \n“inconclusive”;  (iii)  does  not  indicate  that  “providing  an \ninmate with ‘“no less than two” grams’ of sodium pentothal, \nas  is  Florida’s  procedure,  is  not  sufficient  to  render  the \ninmate unconscious”; and (iv) does not provide evidence \nthat “an adequate amount of sodium pentothal is not being \nadministered in Florida, or that the manner in which this \ndrug is administered in Florida prevents it from having its \ndesired effect.”  Id.  This Court denied certiorari review of \nthe Florida Supreme Court’s decision.  See Hill v. Florida, No. \n05-8731, 2006 WL 160276 (U.S. Feb. 27, 2006).  \nGiven the merits review that Hill received in the Florida \nSupreme Court (and the existence, even if unexercised, of \ncertiorari review in this Court), the fact that Hill does not \n\n  29\nhave  at  his  disposal  the  full  panoply  of  federal-court \nremedies – including §1983 – is of no particular moment.  \nThere  are  all  manner  of  procedural  rules,  defenses,  and \ndoctrines  that,  in  certain  circumstances,  will  operate  to \nforeclose  a  federal  court’s  consideration  of  a  federal \nconstitutional claim under §1983 – even where that claim has \nnever before been decided on the merits.  See, e.g., Migra v. \nWarren City Sch. Dist., 465 U.S. 75, 83-84 (1984) (res judicata); \nWilson  v.  Garcia,  471  U.S.  261,  280  (1985)  (statute  of \nlimitations); Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 48-49 (1998) \n(absolute immunity).   \nThe unstated premise of Hill’s argument here – that if \nhabeas corpus is not available to him, §1983 must be – has \nbeen squarely rejected by this Court.  In Allen v. McCurry, \n449  U.S.  90  (1980),  this  Court  reviewed  a  lower-court \ndecision holding, in essence, that because under Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976), a state convict could not raise his \nFourth  Amendment  claim  in  a  federal  habeas  corpus \npetition, he was entitled to a “federal judicial hearing of that \nclaim in a §1983 suit.”  Allen, 449 U.S. at 103.  This Court \nexpressly rejected that holding, as well as the supposition \nunderlying it “that every person asserting a federal right is \nentitled to one unencumbered opportunity to litigate that \nright  in  a  federal  district  court,  regardless  of  the  legal \nposture  in  which  the  federal  claim  arises.”    Id.    That \nassumption, this Court observed, has no support either “in \nthe Constitution” or “in §1983 itself.”  Id.   \nThe Allen Court added, in words uniquely applicable \nhere, that “[t]he only other conceivable basis for finding a \nuniversal right to litigate a federal claim in a federal district \ncourt  is  hardly  a  legal  basis  at  all,  but  rather  a  general \ndistrust of the capacity of the state courts to render correct \ndecisions on constitutional issues.”  Id. at 105.  This Court \nthen  “emphatic[ally]  reaffirm[ed]  …  the  constitutional \nobligation of the state courts to uphold federal law” and \nexpressed  its  “confidence  in  their  ability  to  do  so.”    Id., \naccord, e.g., Stone, 428 U.S. at 493-94 n.35; Huffman v. Pursue, \n\n  30\n420 U.S. 592, 611 (1975); Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 460- \n61 (1974); Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251 (1886) .  \nAccordingly, Hill’s invocation of the maxim ubi jus, ubi \nremedium  and  citation  to  Marbury  v.  Madison,  5  U.S.  (1 \nCranch)  137  (1803),  just  don’t  wash.    Hill  has  not  been \ndenied a forum in which to litigate his claim – he has, at \nmost,  been  denied  a  forum  of  his  choice,  i.e.,  an \n“unencumbered  opportunity  to  litigate  that  [claim]  in  a \nfederal district court.”  And under Allen and its precursors, \nthat is a constitutional non-event.  449 U.S. at 103.   \nHill had his day in court, and he lost.  He then had \nrecourse to this Court – a federal court, no less – by way of a \npetition for certiorari.  That is all the law requires. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should affirm the \ncourt of appeals’ judgment. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nTroy King \nAttorney General \n   \nKevin C.

According to Dr. Mark Heath,   \nthere is an alternative procedure \nthat the Defendants could utilize \nin gaining venous access in the \nPlaintiff that would easily rem-\nedy or mitigate the risks of un-\nnecessary pain and suffering in-\nherent in the cut-down procedure \nDefendant  Culliver  intends  to \nutilize.  (See Paragraphs 20, 21, \n22, and 23 of Affidavit of Mark \nHeath, M.D.). \n \n63.  This alternative procedure is   \nreferred to by several terms, in-\ncluding percutaneous central line \nplacement,  percutaneous  central \naccess, percutaneous central ve-\nnous cannulation, and percutane-\nous technique.  (See Paragraph 23 \nof  Affidavit  of  Mark  Heath, \nM.D.). \n \n64.  This procedure has, except in   \nrare  circumstances,  supplanted \nthe use of the cut-down proce-\ndure and is superior to the cut-\ndown procedure in virtually all \nregards.    (See  Paragraph  23  of \n\n  6\n \nORIGINAL COMPLAINT:   AMENDED COMPLAINT:  \nCUT-DOWN   CENTRAL LINE PLACEMENT  \n \nAffidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n \n65.  This procedure is less inva-  \nsive, less painful, faster, cheaper, \nand safer that [sic] the cut-down \nprocedure.  (See Paragraph 23 of \nAffidavit of Mark Heath, M.D.). \n \n66.  Because of this procedure’s   \nmore widespread use, more phy-\nsicians are proficient and compe-\ntent in performing this procedure \nas  compared  to  the  cut-down \nprocedure. \n \n67.  It would be extraordinarily   \nrare to perform a central venous \ncut-down procedure without first \nattempting and failing to success-\nfully obtain venous access using \nthis procedure. \n \n68.

For this Court and for the   \npublic to determine whether le-\nthal  injection  execution  in  the \nState  of  Alabama  in  being  hu-\nmanely  administered  in  cases \nwhere  peripheral  intravenous \naccess is not possible, the State of \nAlabama  must  disclose  reliable \ninformation about its lethal injec-\ntion protocol and the mandated \nmedical procedures that will be \nemployed to gain venous access \nin condemned prisoners. \n \n76.  As it stands now, this Court,   \nthe public, and the Plaintiff are \nbeing forced to rely upon the very \npeople responsible for designing \nand  administering  the  protocol \nand performing the invasive and \nrisky medical procedures for as-\nsurances  that  the  protocol  and \nprocedures  are  sound  and  that \nthey comport with “the evolving \nstandards of decency”. \n \n77.  in order to pass constitutional   \nmuster, an independent body – \nsuch as this Court or the public – \nmust be allowed to review the \nState of Alabama’s protocol. \n \n78.

MCDONOUGH, INTERIM SECRETARY, FLOR-\nIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 05–8794.  Argued April 26, 2006—Decided June 12, 2006 \nFacing execution in Florida, petitioner Hill brought this federal action\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983 to enjoin the three-drug lethal injection pro-\ncedure the State likely would use on him.  He alleged the procedure \ncould cause him severe pain and thereby violate the Eighth Amend-\nment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments.  The District \nCourt found that under controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent the\n§1983 claim was the functional equivalent of a habeas petition.  Be-\ncause Hill had sought federal habeas relief earlier, the court deemed\nhis petition successive and barred under 28 U. S. C. §2244.  The Elev-\nenth Circuit agreed and affirmed.   \nHeld: Because Hill’s claim is comparable in its essentials to the §1983\naction the Court allowed to proceed in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U. S. \n637, it does not have to be brought in habeas, but may proceed under \n§1983.  Pp. 4–10.\n(a) Nelson controls here.  Although an inmate’s challenge to the law-\nfulness of a sentence or confinement is the province of habeas corpus, \ne.g., Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S. 749, 750, the Nelson Court de-\nclined to deem the instant §1983 Eighth Amendment “challenge seek-\ning to permanently enjoin the use of lethal injection . . . a challenge to\nthe fact of the sentence itself,” 541 U. S., at 644.  Nelson’s veins were \nseverely compromised, and Alabama planned to apply an invasive\nsurgical procedure to enable the injection.  However, that procedure \nwas not mandated by state law, and Nelson appeared willing to con-\ncede the existence of an acceptable alternative procedure.  Absent a \nfinding that the procedure was necessary to the lethal injection, the\nCourt concluded, injunctive relief would not prevent the State from\nimplementing the sentence.  Id., at 645–646.  Here, as in Nelson, \n\n2  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nSyllabus \nHill’s action if successful would not necessarily prevent the State\nfrom executing him by lethal injection.  He does not challenge his \nsentence as a general matter but seeks only to enjoin respondents\nfrom executing him in a manner that allegedly causes a foreseeable\nrisk of gratuitous and unnecessary pain.  He concedes that other le-\nthal injection methods the State could choose would be constitutional, \nand respondents do not contend, at least at this point, that an injunc-\ntion would leave no other practicable, legal method of lethally inject-\ning Hill.  Florida law, moreover, does not require the use of the chal-\nlenged procedure.  Under these circumstances a grant of injunctive\nrelief could not be seen as barring the execution of Hill’s sentence.\nThe fact that Hill challenges the chemical injection sequence rather \nthan a preliminary surgical procedure does not change the analysis.\nIn Nelson, the Court reasoned that “the gravamen of petitioner’s en-\ntire claim” was that the surgical procedure was “gratuitous,” id., at \n645, whereas Hill alleges that the procedure he challenges presents a\nrisk of pain the State can avoid while still being able to enforce his \nsentence.   \nThe Court rejects two rules proposed by respondents and their \namici to counter the prospect of inmates filing successive §1983 ac-\ntions challenging one aspect of an execution procedure after another \nin order to forestall execution.  First, the United States contends that \na capital litigant’s §1983 action can proceed only if, as in Nelson, the \nprisoner identifies an alternative, authorized method of execution. \nAlthough Nelson’s doing so supported the Court’s conclusion that his \nsuit need not proceed as a habeas action, that fact was not decisive. \nNelson  did  not  change  the  traditional  pleading  requirements  for \n§1983 actions.  Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general rule, through\nfederal courts’ case-by-case determinations.  Second, relying on cases \nbarring §1983 damages actions that, if successful, would imply the\ninvalidation of an existing sentence or confinement, see, e.g., Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U. S. 477, respondents and the amici States contend \nthat any challenge that would frustrate an execution as a practical\nmatter must proceed in habeas.  This argument cannot be squared \nwith Nelson’s observation, 541 U. S., at 646–647, that its criterion— \nwhether granting relief would necessarily bar the inmate’s execu-\ntion—is consistent with those cases.  Because injunctive relief would \nnot necessarily foreclose Florida from executing Hill by lethal injec-\ntion under present law, it could not be said that this suit seeks to es-\ntablish “unlawfulness [that] would render a conviction or sentence\ninvalid,” Heck, supra, at 486. Pp. 4–9.\n(b) Filing a §1983 action does not entitle the complainant to an \nautomatic stay of execution.  Such a stay is an equitable remedy not \n\nCite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)  3 \nSyllabus \navailable as a matter of right, and equity must be sensitive to the\nState’s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without \nundue interference from federal courts.  Thus, inmates seeking time \nto challenge the manner of their execution must satisfy all of the re-\nquirements for a stay, including showing a significant possibility of \nsuccess on the merits.  A court considering a stay must also apply a \nstrong equitable presumption against granting relief where the claim \ncould have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of \nthe merits without requiring a stay.  Nelson, supra, at 650.  After \nNelson federal courts have invoked their equitable powers to dismiss\nsuits they saw as speculative or filed too late.  Repetitive or piecemeal \nlitigation presumably would raise similar concerns.  States can and \nshould be protected from dilatory or speculative suits, but it is not\nnecessary to reject Nelson to do so.  The equities and merits of Hill’s\nunderlying action are not before this Court.

JAMES R. \n\nMCDONOUGH, INTERIM SECRETARY, \n\nFLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF \n\nCORRECTIONS, ET AL. \n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\nAPPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n[June 12, 2006] \n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. \nPetitioner Clarence E. Hill challenges the constitution-\nality of a three-drug sequence the State of Florida likely \nwould use to execute him by lethal injection.  Seeking to\nenjoin the procedure, he filed this action in the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Florida, \npursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. §1979, \nas amended, 42 U. S. C. §1983.  The District Court and the \nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit construed the\naction as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ordered \nit dismissed for noncompliance with the requirements for \na second and successive petition.  The question before us is\nwhether Hill’s claim must be brought by an action for a \nwrit of habeas corpus under the statute authorizing that \nwrit, 28 U. S. C. §2254, or whether it may proceed as an \naction for relief under 42 U. S. C. §1983. \nThis is not the first time we have found it necessary to\ndiscuss  which  of  the  two  statutes  governs  an  action\nbrought by a prisoner alleging a constitutional violation. \n\n2  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nOpinion of the Court \nSee, e.g., Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U. S. 637 (2004); Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 \nU. S. 475 (1973).  Hill’s suit, we now determine, is compara-\nble in its essentials to the action the Court allowed to pro-\nceed under §1983 in Nelson, supra.  In accord with that \nprecedent we now reverse. \nI \nIn  the  year  1983,  Hill  was  convicted  of  first-degree\nmurder and sentenced to death.  When his conviction and \nsentence became final some five years later, the method of\nexecution then prescribed by Florida law was electrocu-\ntion.  Fla. Stat. §922.10 (1987).  On January 14, 2000—\nfour days after the conclusion of Hill’s first, unsuccessful \nround  of  federal  habeas  corpus  litigation—Florida\namended  the  controlling  statute  to  provide:  “A  death\nsentence shall be executed by lethal injection, unless the\nperson sentenced to death affirmatively elects to be exe-\ncuted  by  electrocution.”  §922.105(1)  (2003).  The  now-\ncontrolling statute, which has not been changed in any \nrelevant  respect,  does  not  specify  a  particular  lethal-\ninjection procedure.  Implementation is the responsibility \nof the Florida Department of Corrections.  See ibid.; Sims \nv. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 670 (Fla. 2000) (per curiam).  The \ndepartment  has  not  issued  rules establishing  a  specific \nlethal-injection protocol, and its implementing policies and \nprocedures appear exempt from Florida’s Administrative\nProcedure Act.  See §922.105(7).\nAfter  the  statute  was  amended  to  provide  for  lethal \ninjection, the Florida Supreme Court heard a death row \ninmate’s claim that the execution procedure violated the \nEighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  of  cruel  and  unusual\npunishments.  Sims v. State, supra.  In Sims, the com-\nplainant, who had acquired detailed information about the \nprocedure from the State, contended the planned three-\ndrug sequence of injections would cause great pain if the \n\nCite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)  3 \nOpinion of the Court \ndrugs were not administered properly.  754 So. 2d, at 666– \n668.  The Florida Supreme Court rejected this argument \nas too speculative.  Id., at 668. \nOn November 29, 2005, the Governor of Florida signed \nHill’s death warrant, which ordered him to be executed on \nJanuary 24, 2006.  Hill requested information about the\nlethal  injection  protocol,  but  the  department  provided \nnone.  App. 21, n. 3 (Verified Complaint for Declaratory & \nInjunctive Relief ¶15, n. 3 (hereinafter Complaint)).  Hill \nthen challenged, for the first time, the State’s lethal injec-\ntion procedure.  On December 15, 2005, he filed a succes-\nsive postconviction petition in state court, relying upon the\nEighth Amendment.  The trial court denied Hill’s request\nfor  an  evidentiary  hearing  and  dismissed  his  claim  as\nprocedurally barred.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed\non January 17, 2006.  Hill v. State, 921 So. 2d 579, cert. \ndenied, 546 U. S. ___ (2006). \nThree days later—and four days before his scheduled \nexecution—Hill brought this action in District Court pur-\nsuant to 42 U. S. C. §1983.  Assuming the State would use \nthe procedure discussed at length in the Sims decision, see \nApp. 20–21, and n. 3 (Complaint ¶15, n. 3), Hill alleged \nthat the first drug injected, sodium pentothal, would not\nbe a sufficient anesthetic to render painless the admini-\nstration of the second and third drugs, pancuronium bro-\nmide and potassium chloride.  There was an ensuing risk,\nHill alleged, that he could remain conscious and suffer \nsevere pain as the pancuronium paralyzed his lungs and\nbody and the potassium chloride caused muscle cramping\nand a fatal heart attack.  Id., at 18–21 (Complaint ¶¶9–\n16).  The complaint sought an injunction “barring defen-\ndants from executing Plaintiff in the manner they cur-\nrently intend.”  Id., at 22 (Complaint ¶¶19–20).\nThe District Court found that under controlling Elev-\nenth Circuit precedent the §1983 claim was the functional \nequivalent of a petition for writ of habeas corpus.  Id., at \n\n4  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nOpinion of the Court \n15 (relying on Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F. 3d 1281 (2004)). \nBecause Hill had sought federal habeas corpus relief in an\nearlier  action,  the  District  Court  deemed  his  petition\nsuccessive and thus barred for failure to obtain leave to \nfile from the Court of Appeals as required by 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(b).  On the day of the scheduled execution the Court \nof Appeals affirmed.  It held that Hill’s action was a suc-\ncessive petition and that it would deny any application for \nleave  to  file  a  successive  petition  because  §2244(b)(2)\nwould not allow his claim to proceed.  Hill v. Crosby, 437 \nF. 3d 1084, 1085 (CA11 2006).  After issuing a temporary\nstay  of  execution,  this  Court  granted  Hill’s  petition  for \ncertiorari and continued the stay pending our resolution of\nthe case.  546 U. S. ___ (2006). \nII \n“Federal law opens two main avenues to relief on com-\nplaints  related  to  imprisonment:  a  petition  for  habeas\ncorpus, 28 U. S. C. §2254, and a complaint under the Civil \nRights  Act  of  1871,  Rev.  Stat.  §1979,  as  amended,  42 \nU. S. C. §1983.  Challenges to the lawfulness of confinement\nor to particulars affecting its duration are the province of \nhabeas corpus.”  Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S. 749, 750 \n(2004)  (per  curiam)  (citing  Preiser,  supra,  at  500).    An \ninmate’s  challenge  to  the  circumstances  of  his  confine-\nment, however, may be brought under §1983.  540 U. S., at \n750. \nIn Nelson v. Campbell, supra, we addressed whether a \nchallenge to a lethal injection procedure must proceed as a \nhabeas  corpus  action.  The  complainant  had  severely \ncompromised peripheral veins, and Alabama planned to \napply an invasive procedure on his arm or leg to enable \nthe injection.  He sought to enjoin the procedure, alleging\nit would violate the Eighth Amendment.  The Court ob-\nserved that the question whether a general challenge to a \nmethod of execution must proceed under habeas was a \n\nCite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)  5 \nOpinion of the Court \ndifficult  one.  The  claim  was  not  easily  described  as a\nchallenge to the fact or duration of a sentence; yet in a \nState where the legislature has established lethal injection\nas  the  method  of  execution,  “a  constitutional  challenge \nseeking to permanently enjoin the use of lethal injection\nmay amount to a challenge to the fact of the sentence\nitself.”  Id., at 644. \nNelson  did  not  decide  this  question.    The  lawsuit  at \nissue, as the Court understood the case, did not require an\ninjunction that would challenge the sentence itself.  The \ninvasive procedure in Nelson was not mandated by law, \nand the inmate appeared willing to concede the existence\nof an acceptable alternative procedure.  Id., at 645–646. \nAbsent a finding that the challenged procedure was neces-\nsary to the lethal injection, the Court concluded, injunctive\nrelief would not prevent the State from implementing the \nsentence.  Consequently, the suit as presented would not \nbe deemed a challenge to the fact of the sentence itself. \nSee ibid. \nThe decision in Nelson also observed that its holding\nwas  congruent  with  the  Court’s  precedents  addressing\ncivil rights suits for damages that implicate habeas relief. \nThose cases provide that prisoners’ suits for damages can \nbe barred from proceeding under §1983 when a judgment\nin the prisoner’s favor necessarily implies the invalidity of \nthe prisoner’s sentence.  See, e.g., Heck, 512 U. S., at 487; \nClose, supra, at 751.  The action in Nelson, however, was \nnot analogous to a damages suit filed to circumvent the \nlimits imposed by the habeas statute.  The suit did not \nchallenge  an  execution  procedure  required  by  law,  so \ngranting relief would not imply the unlawfulness of the \nlethal injection sentence.  See 541 U. S., at 647. \nIn  the  case  before  us  we  conclude  that  Hill’s  §1983 \naction is controlled by the holding in Nelson.  Here, as in \nNelson,  Hill’s action if successful would not necessarily\nprevent the State from executing him by lethal injection. \n\n6  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nOpinion of the Court \nThe  complaint  does  not  challenge  the  lethal  injection\nsentence as a general matter but seeks instead only to\nenjoin the respondents “from executing [Hill] in the man-\nner they currently intend.”  App. 22 (Complaint ¶20).  The \nspecific objection is that the anticipated protocol allegedly \ncauses “a foreseeable risk of . . . gratuitous and unneces-\nsary” pain.  Id., at 46 (Application for Stay of Execution \nand  for  Expedited  Appeal).    Hill  concedes  that  “other \nmethods of lethal injection the Department could choose to \nuse would be constitutional,” Brief for Petitioner 17, and \nrespondents do not contend, at least to this point in the\nlitigation, that granting Hill’s injunction would leave the \nState without any other practicable, legal method of exe-\ncuting Hill by lethal injection.  Florida law, moreover, does \nnot  require  the  Department  of  Corrections  to  use  the\nchallenged  procedure.  See  Fla.  Stat.  §§922.105(1),  (7) \n(prescribing lethal injection and leaving implementation to\nthe Department of Corrections).  Hill’s challenge appears\nto leave the State free to use an alternative lethal injection\nprocedure.  Under these circumstances a grant of injunc-\ntive relief could not be seen as barring the execution of \nHill’s sentence. \nOne difference between the present case and Nelson, of \ncourse, is that Hill challenges the chemical injection se-\nquence rather than a surgical procedure preliminary to \nthe lethal injection.  In Nelson, however, the State argued \nthat the invasive procedure was not a medical operation \nseparable from the lethal injection but rather a “necessary\nprerequisite to, and thus an indispensable part of, any \nlethal injection procedure.”  541 U. S., at 645.  The Court \nreasoned that although venous access was necessary for \nlethal injection, it did not follow that the State’s chosen\nmeans of access were necessary; “the gravamen of peti-\ntioner’s entire claim” was that the procedure was “gratui-\ntous.”  Ibid.  (emphasis deleted).  The same is true here. \nAlthough the injection of lethal chemicals is an obvious \n\nCite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)  7 \nOpinion of the Court \nnecessity  for  the  execution,  Hill  alleges  that  the  chal-\nlenged procedure presents a risk of pain the State can \navoid while still being able to enforce the sentence order-\ning a lethal injection. \nOne concern is that the foregoing analysis may be more \ntheoretical  than  real  based  on  the  practicalities  of  the \ncase.  A procedure that avoids the harms Hill alleges, for \ninstance, may be susceptible to attack for other purported \nrisks of its own.  Respondents and their supporting amici \nthus  contend  that  the  legal  distinction  between  habeas\ncorpus and §1983 actions must account for the practical \nreality  of  capital  litigation  tactics:  Inmates  file  these \nactions  intending  to  forestall  execution,  and  Nelson’s \nemphasis on whether a suit challenges something “neces-\nsary” to the execution provides no endpoint to piecemeal \nlitigation  aimed  at  delaying  the  execution.    Viewed  in \nisolation, no single component of a given execution proce-\ndure may be strictly necessary, the argument goes, and a \ncapital litigant may put off execution by challenging one \naspect of a procedure after another.  The amici  States \npoint  to  Nelson’s  aftermath  as  a  cautionary  example,\ncontending  that  on  remand  the  District  Court  allowed\nNelson to amend his complaint and that litigation over the \nconstitutionality  of  Alabama’s  adopted  alternative—one \nthat  Nelson  had  previously  proposed—continues  to  this\nday.  See Brief for the State of Alabama et al. 7–14. \nRespondents and their supporting amici conclude that \ntwo  different  rules  should  follow  from  these  practical \nconsiderations.  The United States as amicus curiae con-\ntends that a capital litigant’s §1983 action can proceed if, \nas  in  Nelson,  supra,  at  646,  the  prisoner  identifies  an\nalternative, authorized method of execution.  A suit like \nHill’s that fails to do so, the United States maintains, is \nmore  like  a  claim  challenging  the  imposition  of  any \nmethod of execution—which is to say, the execution it-\nself—because it shows the complainant is unable or un-\n\n8  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nOpinion of the Court \nwilling to concede acceptable alternatives “[e]xcept in the \nabstract.”  Brief for United States 14. \nAlthough we agree courts should not tolerate abusive\nlitigation tactics, see Part III, infra, even if the United \nStates’ proposed limitation were likely to be effective we\ncould not accept it.  It is true that the Nelson plaintiff’s\naffirmative  identification  of  an  acceptable  alternative\nsupported our conclusion that the suit need not proceed as\na habeas action.  541 U. S., at 646 (citing the inmate’s \ncomplaint and affidavits).  That fact, however, was not \ndecisive.  Nelson did not change the traditional pleading \nrequirements for §1983 actions.  If the relief sought would \nforeclose  execution,  recharacterizing  a  complaint  as  an\naction for habeas corpus might be proper.  See id., at 644, \n646.  Cf. Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. ___ (2005).  Imposi-\ntion  of  heightened  pleading  requirements,  however,  is \nquite a different matter.  Specific pleading requirements\nare mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and \nnot, as a general rule, through case-by-case determina-\ntions of the federal courts.  See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8 and \n9; Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 512–514 \n(2002).\nRespondents and the States as amici frame their argu-\nment differently.  While not asking the Court in explicit \nterms to overrule Nelson, they contend a challenge to a\nprocedure  implicating  the  direct  administration  of  an \nexecution  must  proceed  as  a  habeas  action.    Brief  for \nRespondents 30–31; Brief for the State of Alabama et al. \n16–18.  They rely on cases barring §1983 damages actions\nthat,  if  successful,  would  imply  the  invalidation  of  an\nexisting sentence or confinement.  See, e.g., Edwards v. \nBalisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997); Heck, 512 U. S. 477.  Those \ncases, they contend, demonstrate that the test of whether \nan action would undermine a sentence must “be applied \nfunctionally.”  Brief  for  the  State  of  Alabama  et al.  as \nAmici Curiae 16.  By the same logic, it is said, a suit \n\nCite as: 547 U. S. ____ (2006)  9 \nOpinion of the Court \nshould be brought in habeas if it would frustrate the exe-\ncution as a practical matter.\nThis argument cannot be squared with Nelson’s obser-\nvation that its criterion—whether a grant of relief to the \ninmate would necessarily bar the execution—is consistent \nwith Heck’s and Balisok’s approach to damages actions\nthat implicate habeas relief.  Nelson, supra, at 646–647. \nIn those cases the question is whether “the nature of the\nchallenge to the procedures could be such as necessarily to\nimply  the  invalidity”  of  the  confinement  or  sentence. \nBalisok, supra, at 645.  As discussed above, and at this \nstage of the litigation, the injunction Hill seeks would not \nnecessarily  foreclose  the  State  from  implementing  the \nlethal injection sentence under present law, and thus it \ncould not be said that the suit seeks to establish “unlaw-\nfulness [that] would render a conviction or sentence inva-\nlid.”  Heck, supra, at 486.  Any incidental delay caused by\nallowing Hill to file suit does not cast on his sentence the \nkind of negative legal implication that would require him\nto proceed in a habeas action. \nIII \nFiling an action that can proceed under §1983 does not\nentitle the complainant to an order staying an execution \nas a matter of course.  Both the State and the victims of \ncrime have an important interest in the timely enforce-\nment of a sentence.  Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, \n556 (1998).  Our conclusions today do not diminish that\ninterest, nor do they deprive federal courts of the means to\nprotect it.\nWe state again, as we did in Nelson, that a stay of exe-\ncution is an equitable remedy.  It is not available as a \nmatter of right, and equity must be sensitive to the State’s \nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without\nundue interference from the federal courts.  541 U. S., at \n649–650.  See In re Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236, 239–240 (1992) \n\n10  HILL v. MCDONOUGH \nOpinion of the Court \n(per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 323 (1990) (per \ncuriam) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).  Thus, like other stay \napplicants, inmates seeking time to challenge the manner in\nwhich the State plans to execute them must satisfy all of the \nrequirements for a stay, including a showing of a significant\npossibility of success on the merits.  See Barefoot v. Estelle, \n463 U. S. 880, 895–896 (1983).  See also Mazurek v. Arm-\nstrong, 520 U. S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam) (preliminary\ninjunction not granted unless the movant, by a clear show-\ning, carries the burden of persuasion). \nA court considering a stay must also apply “a strong equi-\ntable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim \ncould have been brought at such a time as to allow consid-\neration  of  the  merits  without  requiring  entry  of  a  stay.” \nNelson, supra, at 650.  See also Gomez v. United States Dist. \nCourt for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653, 654 (1992) \n(per  curiam)  (noting  that  the  “last-minute  nature  of  an \napplication” or an applicant’s “attempt at manipulation” of \nthe judicial process may be grounds for denial of a stay). \nAfter Nelson a number of federal courts have invoked their \nequitable powers to dismiss suits they saw as speculative or \nfiled too late in the day.  See, e.g., Hicks v. Taft, 431 F. 3d \n916 (CA6 2005); White v. Johnson, 429 F. 3d 572 (CA5 2005); \nBoyd v. Beck, 404 F. Supp. 2d 879 (EDNC 2005).  Although\nthe particular determinations made in those cases are not \nbefore us, we recognize that the problem they address is \nsignificant.  Repetitive or piecemeal litigation presumably\nwould raise similar concerns.  The federal courts can and \nshould protect States from dilatory or speculative suits, but \nit is not necessary to reject Nelson to do so. \nThe equities and the merits of Hill’s underlying action are \nalso not before us.  We reverse the judgment of the Court of \nAppeals and remand the case for further proceedings consis-\ntent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. ",

Consent  of  Petitioner’s \nCounsel of Record and the State District Attorney’s Office \nhas been obtained.1 \n    Human  Rights  Advocates,  a  California  non-profit \ncorporation, founded in 1978, with national and interna-\ntional  membership,  endeavors  to  advance  the  cause  of \nhuman rights to ensure that the most basic protections are \nafforded  to  everyone.  Human  Rights  Advocates  has  a \nSpecial Consultative Status at the United Nations. Hu-\nman  Rights  Advocates  has  submitted  briefs  as  amicus \ncuriae  in  cases  involving  individual  and  group  rights \nwhere  international  standards  offer  assistance  in  inter-\npreting both state and federal statutes at issue.2 \n    Human Rights Watch is a non-governmental organi-\nzation established in 1978 to monitor and promote obser-\nvance of internationally recognized human rights. It also \n \n    1 Letters from both counsel consenting to the filing of this brief are \nbeing sent with this brief to the Clerk of this Court. Counsel for a party \ndid not author this brief in whole or in part. No person or entity, other \nthan  the  Amicus  Curiae,  their  members  or  their  counsel  made  a \nmonetary contribution to the preparation and submission of the brief. \n    2 Examples  of  amicus  briefs  filed  by  Human  Rights Advocates \ninclude those in the following cases: Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 \n(2005); Coalition for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 110 F.3d 1431 (9th Cir. \n1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 963 (1997); Cal. Fed.

State, 842 P.2d 1240, 4 Cal. 4th 668 (1992). \n\n2 \nhas Special Consultative Status at the United Nations. It \nregularly reports on human rights conditions in more than \nseventy countries around the world, and it actively pro-\nmotes  legislation  and  policies  worldwide  that  advance \nprotections  in  the  area  of  domestic  and  international \nhuman rights and humanitarian law. \n    Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights (“Minnesota \nAdvocates”), founded in 1983, is a volunteer-based non-\nprofit organization committed to the impartial promotion \nand protection of international human rights standards \nand the rule of law. Minnesota Advocates conducts a broad \nrange of innovative programs to promote human rights in \nthe United States and around the world, including human \nrights monitoring and fact finding, direct legal representa-\ntion, education and training, and publications. Minnesota \nAdvocates has produced more than fifty reports document-\ning  human  rights  practices  in  more  than  twenty-five \ncountries; educated more than 10,000 students and com-\nmunity members on human rights issues; and provided \nlegal representation to thousands of low-income individu-\nals.  Minnesota  Advocates’  Death  Penalty  Project  was \norganized in 1991 to recruit Minnesota attorneys to assist \ndeath  row  inmates  with  their  post-conviction  appeals. \nMinnesota  Advocates  previously  has  submitted  amicus \ncuriae briefs in numerous cases, including to the Inter-\nAmerican Court of Human Rights.  \n    Amici would like to take the opportunity to advise this \nCourt of the pertinent international standards that may \nprovide  assistance  in  interpreting  the  United  States \nconstitutional provisions involved in this case. Specifically, \namici would like to address issues raised by Petitioner \nregarding the use of the use of the lethal injection protocol \ncurrently employed by Florida Department of Corrections. \n\n3 \nThe  applicable  international  standards  include:  1)  two \ninternational treaties ratified by the United States, and 2) \nthe interpretation of relevant clauses of one of the treaties \nby the body specifically charged with enforcing the treaty. \n    While international law does not prohibit the death \npenalty,  it  does  limit  methods  that  may  be  used.  The \ntreaty law in this area requires that the death penalty be \napplied in such a manner as to cause the least possible \nphysical and mental suffering. The parties have failed to \naddress  that  requirement.  Because  the  Court  may  find \nthis new information helpful, amici request that the Court \nconsider it. \n--------------------------------- ♦ --------------------------------- \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n    In a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and \nfiled in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Florida, petitioner Clarence Hill alleged that \nthe defendants, acting under color of state law, are using a \nprotocol for carrying out executions by lethal injection that \ncreates  a  foreseeable  and  unnecessary  risk  of  inflicting \npain. This Court granted certiorari in order to determine \nwhether such a claim is properly brought under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, or in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Amici \nurge the Court to consider the international treaty obliga-\ntions in determining the appropriateness of raising this \nclaim under Section 1983. \n    Florida’s procedures for lethal injection are not pre-\nscribed  by  statute  but  are  left  to  the  discretion  of  the \nDepartment  of  Corrections.  At  the  present  time,  they \nappear to be the same as when they were described in \nSims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 665 n.17 (2000): \n\n4 \nIn all, a total of eight syringes will be used, each \nof which will be injected in a consecutive order \ninto the IV tube attached to the inmate. The first \ntwo  syringes  will  contain  “no  less  than”  two \ngrams of sodium pentothal, an ultra-short-acting \nbarbiturate  which  renders  the  inmate  uncon-\nscious. The third syringe will contain a saline so-\nlution to act as a flushing agent. The fourth and \nfifth syringes will contain no less than fifty milli-\ngrams of pancuronium bromide, which paralyzes \nthe muscles. The sixth syringe will contain sa-\nline, again as a flushing agent. Finally, the sev-\nenth  and  eighth  syringes  will  contain  no  less \nthan one-hundred-fifty milliequivalents of potas-\nsium chloride, which stops the heart from beat-\ning. \n    Virtually all U.S. jurisdictions that perform executions \nby lethal injection appear to use a similar three-chemical \nprotocol.  Recently,  problems  with  California’s  cognate \nprotocol were found in Morales v. Hickman, __ F. Supp.2d \n__, 2006 WL 335427 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2006), where the \ndistrict court noted than in six out of thirteen California \nexecutions by lethal injection, the State’s own execution \nlogs “raise[d] at least some doubt as to whether the proto-\ncol  actually  is  functioning  as  intended,”  id.  at  *6,  and \nparticularly observed that four of the logs “contain indica-\ntions that there may have been problems associated with \nthe  administration  of  the  chemicals  that  may  have  re-\nsulted in the prisoners being conscious during portions of \nthe executions,” id. at 4 (quoting Beardslee v. Woodford, \n395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005)). \n    The trauma experienced by a person who regains or \nretains consciousness, who cannot communicate that fact \nbecause he has received a paralytic agent, and who is then \n\n5 \nsubjected to a painful procedure is almost unimaginable, \nas shown by the experience of Carol Weihrer: \nAccording to Weihrer’s affidavit, she underwent \neye surgery. The sedative she received was inef-\nfectual and left her conscious during the entire \nsurgery. Because of the administration of a neu-\nromuscular  blocking  agent  like  pancuronium \nbromide, however, she was unable to indicate her \nconsciousness and horrific pain to the doctor re-\nmoving her eyeball for surgical repair: “I there-\nfore experienced what has come to be known as \nAnesthesia Awareness,  in  which  I  was  able  to \nthink lucidly, hear, perceive, and feel everything \nthat was going on during the surgery, but I was \nunable to move. It burnt like the fires of hell. It \nwas the most terrifying, torturous experience you \ncan  imagine.  The  experience  was  worse  than \ndeath.” \nPress Release, Office of the Ohio Public Defender, Ohio’s \nExecution Procedure’s Not Fit for a Dog, http://opd.ohio. \ngov/press/pr_12_31-03.htm (Dec. 31, 2003) (quoting Affida-\nvit  of  Carol  Weihrer  and  describing  Section  1983  com-\nplaint  and  attachments  filed  that  day  by  condemned \ninmates Lewis Williams Jr. and John Glenn Roe). \n    In the instant case, the district court did not address \nthe substance of Clarence Hill’s Section 1983 complaint, \nand instead dismissed the action on jurisdictional grounds. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed that decision.  \n--------------------------------- ♦ --------------------------------- \n \n\n6 \nARGUMENT \nUNITED  STATES  TREATY  OBLIGATIONS  SUP-\nPORT  PETITIONER’S  CONTENTION  THAT  THE \nCURRENT PROTOCOL FOR LETHAL INJECTION \nVIOLATES THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n    The  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political \nRights, G.A.

The  document  should,  there-\nfore, provide meaningful guidance to the Court.3 \n    Article 7 of the Covenant provides: “No one shall be \nsubjected  to  torture  or  to  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading \ntreatment  or  punishment.”  Covenant,  supra,  at  art.  7. \nArticle 4(2) of the Covenant indicates that Article 7 is at \nno  times  derogable.  Id.  at  art.  4(2).  In  addition  to  the \nprohibition  against  torture,  the  Convention  Against \nTorture, supra, in Article 16, § 1 provides: \nEach State Party shall undertake to prevent in \nany territory under its jurisdiction other acts of \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or pun-\nishment which do not amount to torture as de-\nfined in article 1, when such acts are committed \nby or at the instigation of or with the consent or \nacquiescence of a public official or other person \nacting in an official capacity. \n    The  Human  Rights  Committee  is  the  body  which \nofficially monitors compliance with the Covenant. In its \n \n    3 The  Senate  consent  to  the  Covenant  was  accompanied  by  a \ndeclaration “that the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 are not self-\nexecuting.” S. Res. 4783, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The legislative \nhistory shows that those words were intended to prohibit only a private \nand independent cause of action. The declaration does not preclude \ncourts from using the treaty as a guide in elucidating constitutional \nguarantees. The United States government’s position is that “courts \ncould refer to the Covenant and take guidance from it.” Statement of \nConrad Harper, Legal Advisor, United States Department of State, to \nthe United Nations Human Rights Committee, U.N. GAOR Hum. Rts. \nComm., 53d Sess., 1405th mtg., U.N. Doc. HR/CT/404 (1995). Further, \nthe declaration does not affect the obligations of the United States \nunder the Covenant. See, David P. Stewart, United States Ratification \nof the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: the Significance of the \nReservations, Understandings, and Declarations, 42 DEPAUL L. REV. \n1183 (1993). \n\n8 \ncomments concerning Article 7 the Committee stated that \n“when the death penalty is applied by a State party for the \nmost serious crimes, . . . it must be carried out in such a \nway as to cause the least possible physical and mental \nsuffering.”  CCPR  Gen.  Comment  20,  U.N.  Hum.  Rts. \nCommittee, 44th Sess., at ¶ 6, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/21/Add. \n3  (1992).  The  Eighth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.” \nU.S. CONST. amend. VIII. Because the United States now \nhas ratified the Covenant, the development of Article 7 \nshould  help  courts  construe  the  scope  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment’s  final  clause.  The  Covenant  has  become  a \npart of United States law and thus surely is relevant to \nthe meaning of the Eighth Amendment.4 \n    The allegations in this case indicate that carrying out \nan execution using the current protocol for lethal injection \ndoes  violate  Article  7,  as  plainly  written  and  officially \nconstrued. The use of this protocol does not reliably “cause \nthe least possible physical and mental suffering.”5 \n \n    4 International human rights standards have often been useful \ntools for interpreting United States laws. See generally, Connie de la \nVega, Protecting Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 15 WHITTIER \nL.REV. 471, 476-77 (1994); Gordon A. Christenson, Using Human Rights \nLaw to Inform Due Process and Equal Protection Analyses, 52 U. CIN. L. \nREV. 3 (1993). See also, Ruth Bader Ginsburg & Deborah Jones Merritt, \nAffirmative  Action:  An  International  Human  Rights  Dialogue,  1 \nRUTGERS RACE & L.REV. 193 (1999); Anne Bayefsky & Joan Fitzpatrick, \nInternational Human Rights Law in United States Courts: A Compara-\ntive Perspective, 14 MICH. J. INT’L L. 1 (1993). \n    5 The  United  States  reservation  to  the  Covenant  that  cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment means the cruel and \nunusual punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth \nAmendments, S. Res. 4783, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), by no means \nprecludes Article 7’s application to this case. Article 7 is not inconsistent \nwith the Eighth Amendment regarding the facts of this case. The \n(Continued on following page) \n\n9 \n    The Human Rights Committee was given the oppor-\ntunity to again construe Article 7 in the case of Charles \nChitat Ng. U.N. Hum. Rts. Committee, 49th Sess., U.N. \nDoc. CCPR/C/49/D/469 (1991). After fleeing to Canada, Ng \nwas returned to the United States under the extradition \ntreaty  between  the  two  nations.  He  submitted  to  the \nHuman Rights Committee a communication claiming that \nthe  extradition  to  California  exposed  him  to  probable \nexecution by gas asphyxiation which violated his rights \nunder the Covenant. Under the extradition treaty, Canada \ncould have sought assurance that he would not be pun-\nished with death, but did not. \n    The Human Rights Committee concluded that Canada \nviolated Article 7 when it refused to seek such assurance \nsince it could reasonably have foreseen that Ng, if sen-\ntenced to death, would be executed by means of lethal gas. \nThe  Committee  specifically  held  that  “execution  by  gas \nasphyxiation,  should  the  death  penalty  be  imposed  on \n[Ng], would not meet the test of ‘least possible physical \nand mental suffering,’ and constitutes cruel and inhuman \ntreatment . . . ” and Canada thus violated Article 7 of the \nCovenant. Id. at 21. The Committee based its findings on \nevidence  submitted  by  Ng  regarding  the  length  of  con-\nsciousness after asphyxiation begins. Ng also referenced \nthe execution record of Robert Harris, noting that death by \nasphyxiation can take up to twelve minutes, during which \ntime  “condemned  persons  remain  conscious,  experience \n \nlanguage of the Eighth Amendment is broad enough to forbid the use of \nthis particular protocol for lethal injection as a means of execution, and \nUnited States courts should not ignore international pronouncements \non treaties to which it is party. \n\n10 \nobvious pain and agony, drool and convulse and often soil \nthemselves.” Id. at 14. \n    There is evidence that protocols similar to that used in \nFlorida have resulted in unnecessary suffering and poten-\ntially excruciating pain and thus in executions that violate \nthe prohibitions of Article 7 and of the Cruel and Unusual \nPunishments  Clause  of  the  Eighth Amendment. As  the \nDistrict Court in Morales found, the evidence of its use in \nCalifornia raises “at least some doubt as to whether [it] \nactually  is  functioning  as  intended.”  Morales,  2006  WL \n335427, at *6. Petitioner should not be subjected to death \nby use of that protocol until there is a judicial assessment \nof the potential for extreme pain that has been involved in \nits  past  use  and  a  determination  of  whether  it  will  be \n“carried it out in such a way as to cause the least possible \nand physical and mental suffering.” CCPR Gen. Comment \n20, supra.  \n    Other  courts  have  examined  particular  methods  of \nexecution  and  found  them  constitutionally  wanting.  A \ncourt  in  California  made  the  following  factual  findings \nwith respect to death by lethal gas:  \n[I]nmates who are put to death in the gas cham-\nber at San Quentin do not become immediately \nunconscious  upon  the  first  breath  of  lethal \ngas. . . . [A]n inmate probably remains conscious \nanywhere from 15 seconds to one minute, and . . . \nthere is a substantial likelihood that conscious-\nness, or a waxing and waning of consciousness, \npersists for several additional minutes. During \nthis  time  . . .  inmates  suffer  intense,  visceral \npain, primarily as a result of lack of oxygen to \nthe cells. The experience of “air hunger” is akin \nto the experience of a major heart attack, or to \nbeing held under water. Other possible effects to \n\n11 \nthe  cyanide  gas  include  tetany,  an  exquisitely \npainful concentration of the muscles, and painful \nbuild-up of lactic acid and adrenaline. Cyanide-\ninduced cellular suffocation causes anxiety, panic, \nterror, and pain. \nFierro v. Gomez, 865 F. Supp. 1387, 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1994) \n(citations omitted). Even though the district court’s deci-\nsion in Fierro has been vacated, the Ninth Circuit has \nupheld the findings of extreme pain and has concluded \nthat the use of execution by lethal gas is unconstitution-\nally cruel and unusual and violates the Eighth and Four-\nteenth Amendments. See, LaGrand v. Stewart, 173 F.3d \n1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 1999). That decision is in conformity \nwith  the  Human  Rights  Committee  decision  in  the  Ng \ncase. \n    At this point in Florida, persons on death row not only \nface the possibility of being subjected to extreme pain, but \nin addition must suffer the anxiety that they may. Amici \nask the Court to consider the significant parallel between \nthe  cases  and  the  treaty  standards  that  apply  when \nreviewing this case. \n--------------------------------- ♦ --------------------------------- \n \nCONCLUSION \n    The imposition of the death penalty using the current \nprotocol for lethal injection potentially violates the Inter-\nnational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \nConvention Against Torture. Because the United States is \na party to both treaties, the Eighth Amendment should be \nconstrued so as not to conflict with it. Hence, the case \nshould be remanded to the lower courts so that there can \n\n12 \nbe a proper trial on the protocol for lethal injection and a \ndetermination can be made on the merits on whether it \ndoes cause the least amount of suffering. \n    Date:  March 3, 2006 \nRespectfully submitted, \nCONSTANCE DE LA VEGA \nCounsel of Record \nDAVID WEISSBRODT \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae \n  Human Rights Advocates \n  Human Rights Watch \n  Minnesota Advocates for \n  Human Rights \n ",

MCDONOUGH, Interim Secretary, \nFlorida Department of Corrections, et al.,\nRespondents.\nBRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF THE \nCRIMINAL JUSTICE LEGAL FOUNDATION \nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE\nThe Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF)1 is a non-\nprofit  California  corporation  organized  to  participate  in\nlitigation relating to the criminal justice system as it affects the\npublic interest.  CJLF seeks to bring the constitutional protec-\ntion of the accused into balance with the rights of the victim\nand of society to rapid, efficient, and reliable determination of\nguilt and swift execution of punishment.\nIn 1996, Congress enacted a landmark reform of the law of\nhabeas corpus, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996, to curb the rampant abuses that had occurred up\n1. This brief was written entirely by counsel for amicus, as listed on the\ncover, and not by counsel for any party.  No outside contributions were\nmade to the preparation or submission of this brief.\nBoth parties have given written consent to the filing of this brief.\n\n2\nto that time, particularly in capital cases.  Petitioner in this case\nseeks to evade the limitations imposed by Congress by caption-\ning his pleading as a civil rights complaint instead of a habeas\npetition.  Such evasion is contrary to the interests CJLF was\nformed to protect.\nSUMMARY OF FACTS AND CASE\nClarence Hill murdered Pensacola Police Officer Steve\nTaylor twenty-three years ago.\n“On October 19, 1982, appellant stole a pistol and an\nautomobile in Mobile, Alabama. Later that day, appellant\nand his accomplice, Cliff Jackson, drove to Pensacola and\nrobbed a savings and loan association at gunpoint. When\nthe police arrived during the robbery, appellant fled out the\nback of the savings and loan building. Jackson exited\nthrough the front door, where he was apprehended immedi-\nately.  Appellant  approached  two  police  officers  from\nbehind as they attempted to handcuff Jackson. Testimony\nestablished that appellant drew his pistol and shot the\nofficers, killing one and wounding the other.”  Hill v. State,\n477 So. 2d 553, 554 (Fla. 1985) (“Hill I”).\nTo say that Hill’s case has been extensively reviewed would\nbe an understatement.  On the first appeal, the Florida Supreme\nCourt affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence based\non denial of a challenge for cause, although the views of the\njuror in question fell well short of the automatic vote rule later\nannounced in Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719, 729 (1992).\nCf. Hill I, supra, at 555.  After a second penalty trial, the\nFlorida Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence.  Hill v.\nState, 515 So. 2d 176 (Fla. 1987) (“Hill II”), cert. denied, Hill\nv. Florida, 485 U. S. 993 (1988).  State postconviction relief\nwas denied on the merits.  See Hill v. Dugger, 556 So. 2d 1385\n(Fla. 1990).\n\n3\nAfter a Federal District Court found fault with the harmless\nerror analysis in Hill II, the Florida Supreme Court reopened\nthe appeal, reweighed the aggravating and mitigating factors,\nand reaffirmed the death sentence.  Hill v. State, 643 So. 2d\n1071, 1072-1074 (Fla. 1994) (“Hill IV”), cert. denied, Hill v.\nFlorida, 516 U. S. 872 (1995).  The Eleventh Circuit had\nstayed its proceedings pending Hill IV, see Hill v. Moore, 175\nF. 3d 915, 920 (CA11 1999), and nearly five years after that\ndecision it affirmed denial of habeas relief.  See id., at 930.\nThis Court denied certiorari on January 10, 2000.  See Hill v.\nMoore, 528 U. S. 1087 (2000).\nFour days later, Governor Jeb Bush signed the bill changing\nFlorida’s primary method of execution to lethal injection.  See\nSims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 663, and n. 11 (Fla. 2000).  The\nFlorida  Supreme  Court  considered  on  the  merits  a  third\npostconviction petition by another inmate nearing execution\nand rejected claims very similar to those being made in the\npresent case.  See id., at 659, 665-668, and nn. 17-20.  The\nquestions about dosage and claims of executions being “botch-\ned” in other states using lethal injection were known and being\nlitigated at the time of enactment of the statute.\nHill pursued postconviction relief on an unrelated issue, see\nPet. for Cert. 5-6, and denial of relief was affirmed by the\nFlorida Supreme Court on May 13, 2005.  See Hill v. State, 904\nSo. 2d 430 (Fla. 2005).\nIn the April 16-22, 2005 issue of The Lancet, a British\nmedical journal, an article claimed that the level of anesthesia\nin American lethal injection procedures may be insufficient to\nprevent  suffering.    See  Koniaris,  Zimmers,  Lubarsky,  &\nSheldon,  Inadequate  Anaesthesia  in  Lethal  Injection  for\nExecution, 365 The Lancet 1412 (2005).2  In the correspon-\n2. Although The Lancet is a reputable journal, an accompanying editorial\ncasts doubt on whether the editors maintain objectivity on this issue.\nFor example, the editorial states, “Few experts believe that the threat of\ncapital  punishment  is  an  effective  deterrent.”    Editorial,  Medical\n\n4\ndence section of a subsequent issue, the article was challenged\nin letters by multiple experts, and the original authors gave their\nreply.  See Groner, et al., Inadequate Anaesthesia in Lethal\nInjection for Execution/Authors’ Reply, 366 The Lancet 1073\n(2005).\nGovernor Bush signed a new death warrant on November\n29, 2005.  See Hill v. State, 2006 Fla. Lexis 8, *2 (Jan. 17,\n2006) (“Hill VII”).  On December 15, after the warrant was\nsigned, eight months after the article was published, and nearly\nsix years after similar issues had been aired in Sims, Hill filed\na new postconviction motion.  Under Florida Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 3.851(h)(5), all such motions filed after issuance of\nthe death warrant are subject to the requirements for successive\nmotions.  See Hill VII, at *4; see also Bell v. Thompson, 545\nU. S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 2825, 2832-2833, 162 L. Ed. 2d 693, 704\n(2005) (recognizing particular disruptiveness of new proceed-\nings after scheduling of execution date).  The circuit court\ndenied the motion, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed on\nJanuary 17, 2006.  Although the Florida Supreme Court’s\ndecision on the injection claim discusses the merits, see Hill\nCollusion in the Death Penalty: An American Atrocity, 365 The Lancet\n1361 (2005).  Even the most elementary literature search, a strict\nprerequisite for a scientific article, would have disclosed the large and\ngrowing body of econometric evidence of deterrence.  See,  e.g.,\nDezhbakhsh, Rubin, & Shepherd, Does Capital Punishment Have a\nDeterrent Effect? New Evidence from Postmoratorium Panel Data, 5\nAm. L. & Econ. Rev. 344 (2003); Mocan & Gittings, Getting Off Death\nRow:  Commuted  Sentences  and  the  Deterrent  Effect  of  Capital\nPunishment, 46 J. L. & Econ. 453 (2003); Shepherd, Murders of\nPassion, Execution Delays, and the Deterrence of Capital Punishment,\n33 J. Legal Studies 283 (2004); see also Articles on Death Penalty\nDeterrence,  http://www.cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DPDeterrence.htm\n(revised Mar. 27, 2006) (collecting abstracts of these and other studies).\nAlthough the deterrence debate is not concluded, the fact that the editors\nof The Lancet would blithely recite a trite and false claim of expert\nconsensus, when there is in fact a robust debate in the published\nliterature, indicates a bias and a disregard for normal standards of\nscientific publications which undercut the probative value of their\nacceptance of the Koniaris article.\n\n5\nVII, at *4-*8, the State characterizes it as a ruling that the claim\nwas procedurally defaulted.  See Brief in Opposition 9, n. 7.3\nOn January 20, Hill applied to the Eleventh Circuit for\nleave to file a successive habeas petition, claiming that he was\nmentally retarded.  See In re Hill, 437 F. 3d 1080 (CA11 2006)\n(“Hill VIII”).  The Court of Appeals denied it as untimely on\nJanuary 24.\nAlso on January 20, Hill filed the present civil rights action\nin Federal District Court under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that lethal injection violates the\nEighth Amendment.  See Hill v. Crosby, 437 F. 3d 1084, 2006\nU.S. App. Lexis 1674, *1 (CA11 2006) (“Hill IX”).  The\nDistrict Court dismissed it the following day on the ground that\nit was the “functional equivalent of a successive habeas peti-\ntion.”  Id., at *2 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court\nof Appeals affirmed, see id., at *2-*3, based on its earlier\ndecision in Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F. 3d 1281 (CA11 2004).\nHill petitioned for a stay and writ of certiorari.  Justice Kennedy\ngranted the stay the same day, and the Court granted the writ of\ncertiorari the next day.  Hill’s stay application and petition for\ncertiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida were denied January\n24 and February 27, respectively.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1871, now codified at 42 U. S. C.\n§1983, may not be used to circumvent the limitations placed on\nhabeas corpus by the Congress and by this Court’s precedents.\nPreiser v. Rodriguez settled that when the relief sought is\nwithin the scope of habeas corpus, that procedure is exclusive.\nIf the limitations placed on habeas preclude relief, §1983\ncannot be used to obtain what Congress has decided to deny.\n3. If the decision had been on the merits, it would have preclusive effect\nin a § 1983 suit.  See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 103-104 (1980).\n\n6\nShorthand references in noncapital cases to the scope of\nhabeas  as  “the  fact  and  duration  of  confinement”  are  not\ncontrolling.  The underlying principle is that the habeas remedy\nis  exclusive  for  claims  within  its  scope.    Habeas  is  well\nestablished as the proper procedure for penalty phase and\nmethod of execution claims going back over a century, even\nthough neither type of claim seeks to shorten the duration of\nconfinement.  Habeas is available for method-of-execution\nclaims  when  they  are  timely  raised,  even  when  the  state\nchanges its method.  It is not available in this case because of\npetitioner’s choice to delay until the eleventh hour, and Con-\ngress’s prohibition of such late claims must not be circum-\nvented.\nARGUMENT\nI.  The rule of Mitchum v. Foster should not be \nextended beyond its purpose.\nA.  Mitchum v. Foster.\nOn its face, the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. §2283,\nwould seem to preclude the injunction that petitioner seeks in\nthis case.  “A court of the United States may not grant an\ninjunction  to  stay  proceedings  in  a  State  court  except  as\nexpressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in\naid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”\n(Emphasis added.)  Justice Brandeis, writing for a unanimous\nCourt, described the predecessor statute in Hill v. Martin, 296\nU. S. 393, 403 (1935) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted): \n“The prohibition of §265 is against a stay of ‘proceedings\nin any court of a State.’  That term is comprehensive.  It\nincludes all steps taken or which may be taken in the state\ncourt or by its officers from the institution to the close of\nthe final process.  It applies to appellate as well as to\noriginal proceedings; and is independent of the doctrine of\nres judicata.  It applies alike to action by the court and by\n\n7\nits ministerial officers; applies not only to execution issued\non a judgment, but to any proceeding supplemental or\nancillary taken with a view to making the suit or judgment\neffective.”\nPetitioner brought the present action under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983.  That statute authorizes a “suit in equity” for violations\nof federal rights.  It says nothing about staying state court\nactions.  Indeed, at the time of Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S.\n225 (1972), it did not mention actions in other courts at all.\nYet Mitchum held, “The test, rather, is whether an Act of\nCongress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable\nin a federal court of equity, could be given its intended scope\nonly by the stay of a state court proceeding.”  Id., at 238.\nApplying that standard to the intent of the Reconstruction\nCongress, Mitchum held that §1983 “falls within the ‘expressly\nauthorized’ exception” to the Anti-Injunction Act.  Id., at 243.\nA leading federal courts casebook asks rhetorically, “Didn’t\nMitchum  read  ‘expressly  authorized’  to  mean  ‘impliedly\nauthorized’?  Is that a tenable position?”  R. Fallon, D. Meltzer,\n& D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s Federal Courts and the\nFederal System 1162 (5th ed. 2003).  Yes, it did, and no, it\nisn’t. Mitchum is judicial disregard of unambiguous statutory\nlanguage of the most blatant kind.  For justification, the opinion\nrelied on caselaw that predated the 1948 enactment of the\npresent statute, see 407 U. S., at 234-235, combined with a\nRevisor’s Note that the statute was intended “to restore ‘the\nbasic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the\nToucey4 decision.’ ”  Id., at 236.\nIt is far from “evident” from this Note that the statute\nextends beyond “the specific holding of Toucey,” cf. ibid., to\nencompass the entire pre-1948 jurisprudence.  The Note hedges\nwith the word “generally,” and the Mitchum opinion can muster\nonly one example of a pre-1948 case where a federal statute\n4. Toucey v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 314 U. S. 118 (1941).\n\n8\nthat does not specifically refer to other court proceedings was\nheld to create an exception.  See id., at 234-235, and nn. 12-17.\nThe one case, referred to in note 17, was an emergency regula-\ntion in wartime, decided after Toucey, not before.  Yet even if\nthe Note did have the sweeping meaning the Mitchum Court\nread into it, it would contradict the fundamental principle that\nlegislative  history  cannot  override  unambiguous  statutory\nlanguage.  “No matter how clearly its report purports to do so,\na committee of Congress cannot take language that could only\ncover ‘flies’ or ‘mosquitos,’ and tell the courts that it really\ncovers ‘ducks.’ ”  Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501\nU. S. 597, 611, n. 4 (1991).  By the same token, a Revisor’s\nNote cannot strike the word “expressly” from the statute, yet\nthat is exactly what Mitchum allowed it to do.\nAlthough wrongly decided, Mitchum is now a precedent of\nlong standing.  It is also a statutory interpretation precedent,\nwhich gives it extra weight in the stare decisis calculus.  See,\ne.g., Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284, 295 (1996).  Amicus\nCJLF therefore does not suggest that it should be overruled.  It\nis entirely plausible that subsequent Congresses have decided\nto leave Mitchum in place because the damage that it might\nhave caused has been effectively contained by the rules of\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973) and Younger v.\nHarris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971).5  Preiser is discussed in Part II,\ninfra, and Younger is discussed in Brief for Criminal Justice\nLegal Foundation as Amicus Curiae in Nelson v. Campbell,\nNo. 03-6821, pp. 10-15.  When applying the Preiser and\nYounger rules, however, it is helpful to keep in mind just how\nshaky is the foundation of authority for federal courts to enjoin\nthe execution of state judgments at all.\nThe  holding  of  Mitchum  rests  entirely  on  the  Court’s\nconclusion that Congress wanted the federal courts to be able\n5. A post-Mitchum amendment to §1983, Pub. L. 104-317, §309(c), 110\nStat. 3853, limits injunctions against judicial officers but implicitly\nauthorizes them in unusual circumstances.\n\n9\nto enjoin state court proceedings under the Civil Rights Act in\ncertain extreme circumstances.  See 407 U. S., at 242.  Where\nthe reason for Mitchum’s rule ends, its rule should end.  See\nLockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 373 (1993).  Injunctions\nagainst state court proceedings under §1983 should not be\nissued in circumstances where issuance is contrary to the intent\nof a later-enacted statute, and a last-minute method-of-execu-\ntion claim in a state capital case is precisely such a circum-\nstance.\nB.  The Harris Case.\nIn the debate over the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the proponents repeatedly cited\none case as the premier example of what was wrong with the\nsystem.  That was the case of Robert Alton Harris, whose\nexecution culminated in Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for\nNorthern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992) and Vasquez v.\nHarris, 503 U. S. 1000 (1992) (per curiam).  See, e.g., 141\nCong. Rec. 4111-4112 (1995) (statement of Mr. Cox); id., at\n14734 (statement of Sen. Feinstein); id., at 15019 (statement of\nSen. Specter).  In that case, a challenge to the standard method\nof execution which had been in use for decades was deliber-\nately withheld through multiple rounds of litigation, including\nan appeal, nine state habeas petitions, and four federal habeas\npetitions, only to be filed in a civil rights suit a few days before\nthe scheduled execution.  See Gomez, supra, at 653 (four prior\nfederal habeas); Lungren & Krotoski, Public Policy Lessons\nfrom the Robert Alton Harris Case, 40 UCLA L. Rev. 295, 322\n(1992) (chronology, noting ninth state habeas petition, execu-\ntion date set for April 21, 1992, civil rights suit filed April 17).\n“There is no good reason for this abusive delay, which has been\ncompounded by last-minute attempts to manipulate the judicial\nprocess.”  Gomez, supra, at 654.\nIn Gomez, this Court did not allow the use of §1983 to\ncircumvent the successive petition rule of McCleskey v. Zant,\n499 U. S. 467 (1991).  Congress responded by enacting a new\n\n10\nsuccessive petition rule, more stringent than McCleskey.  See\n28 U. S. C. §2244(b); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 656-657\n(1996).  No language was included to specifically prohibit use\nof §1983 to evade the new rule.  None appeared to be needed.\nThe  precedents  of  Gomez  and  Preiser  should  have  been\nsufficient.\nIn  passing  AEDPA,  Congress  confirmed  this  Court’s\ndisapproval of the tactics used in the Harris case.  Congress\nraised the hurdle for successive petitions and their accompany-\ning stays several notches higher than this Court’s case law.\nGiven  that  the  Mitchum  rule  is  based  on  an  inference  of\ncongressional intent, the intent of the 104th Congress should\nalso be considered in its application.  That Congress intended\nto sharply limit federal court interference with state capital\njudgments after the first federal petition.  The Preiser rule,\nproperly applied, will implement that intent.\nII.  The Civil Rights Act may not be used to \ncircumvent Congress’s limits on habeas corpus.\nA.  The Specific and the General.\nThis case brings the Court once again to the well-traveled\nintersection between the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U. S. C.\n§1983, and the federal habeas corpus statute for state prisoners,\n28 U. S. C. §2254.  See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 480\n(1994); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 482-484 (1973).\nThe rule of the road is well established that habeas corpus, as\nthe more specific of the two, has the right-of-way at this\ncrossing, i.e., it “must be understood to be the exclusive remedy\navailable in a situation like this where it so clearly applies.”\nPreiser, supra, at 489.  Little more than reaffirmation of this\nprinciple is needed to answer the question presented in this\ncase.\nFederal court litigation by state-court criminal defendants\nhas long raised delicate questions of federalism.  See, e.g., Ex\n\n11\nparte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 252-253 (1886) (habeas); Fenner\nv. Boykin, 271 U. S. 240, 244 (1926) (civil rights); Stefanelli v.\nMinard, 342 U. S. 117, 120 (1951) (“special delicacy”).  Both\nthe habeas statute and the Civil Rights Act require striking a\nbalance between the need to protect federal rights from state\naction and the need to avoid undue interference in the state’s\nadministration of its own laws.  For the Civil Rights Act, these\nneeds are accommodated through several doctrines of “absten-\ntion,” the most important of which is the Younger doctrine.\nSee supra, at 8.  However, the problem has received more\nattention both from this Court and from Congress in the area of\nhabeas corpus, because federalism is implicated in every §2254\ncase, not just occasionally as it is in §1983 litigation.  This\ngreater attention has resulted in a more developed body of law,\nwith a finely crafted set of rules defining the limits of federal\ncourt action.  Particularly where Congress has balanced the\ninterests and defined the limits, courts and litigants must not be\npermitted to evade those limits and upset that balance simply\nby attaching a different label.  See, e.g., Calderon v. Thompson,\n523 U. S. 538, 553-554 (1998) (limits on successive petitions\nguide  discretion  in  motion  to  recall  mandate,  to  preclude\nevasion).\nThe plaintiffs in Preiser had lost good time credits in prison\ndiscipline proceedings and sought to challenge those proceed-\nings in Federal District Court in §1983 actions, combined with\nhabeas corpus petitions.  See 411 U. S., at 476-482.  The relief\nthey sought was release from confinement.  See id., at 487.\nCourt of Appeals panels in two of the three cases held that the\ncases were habeas petitions, not civil rights actions, and as such\nhad to be dismissed for nonexhaustion.  See id., at 479-481.\nThese decisions were reversed en banc.  See id., at 482.  This\nCourt reversed in turn.\nPreiser discusses the scope of habeas corpus and the relief\navailable under it as that procedure had evolved through the\ntime  of  the  decision,  not  just  the  very  limited  review  of\njurisdiction of the committing court available in the early\n\n12\n1800s.  See id., at 484-486.  “In the case before us, the respon-\ndents’ suits  in  the District Court fell squarely within this\ntraditional scope of habeas corpus.”  Id., at 487.  If they\nsucceeded, they would be released from custody earlier, the\nrelief typically available in habeas.  Again, the word “tradi-\ntional” in this passage includes modern expansions of the scope\nof habeas.  See id., at 487-488.  The Preiser Court rejected the\nposition of the dissent that the Civil Rights Act should reach\nwherever habeas relief would not have been available in times\npast.  See id., at 488, n. 8.\nThe broad language of the Civil Rights Act, applicable to\nthe case on its face, was not conclusive.  Preiser held that the\nCivil Rights Act could not be used where the subject matter of\nthe suit was so clearly within the scope of “the specific federal\nhabeas corpus statute.” Id., at 489 (emphasis added).  This\nconclusion was based squarely on the need to prevent evasion\nof congressional limits on habeas, of which exhaustion was the\nmost important at that time.   “It would wholly frustrate explicit\ncongressional intent to hold that the respondents in the present\ncase could evade [the exhaustion] requirement by the simple\nexpedient of putting a different label on their pleadings.”  Id.,\nat 489-490.  Although Preiser speaks in terms of the exhaustion\nrequirement and attacks on the fact and length of confinement,\nits underlying principle is somewhat broader.  If the relief\nsought is the type of relief for which Congress has provided\nhabeas corpus, then the Civil Rights Act must not be used to\nevade the limitations that Congress has placed on habeas and\nupset the balance that Congress has struck.  It is no answer to\nsay that this particular plaintiff cannot actually obtain relief on\nhabeas.  Two of the Preiser plaintiffs could not, because they\nhad failed to exhaust state remedies.  See id., at 479-481.  If\nCongress has decided that habeas relief should not extend to a\nprisoner in the petitioner’s circumstances, that is precisely the\npolicy determination that the courts must respect and not evade\nthrough the Civil Rights Act.  See id., at 490-491.\n\n13\nThe  rule  of  Preiser  that  the  specific  statute,  with  its\nlimitations, controls in the area where the specific and general\nstatutes overlap, see Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 20 (1998)\n(Souter, J., concurring), is simply one application of a well-\nestablished principle.  Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820 (1976)\nillustrates the breadth of this principle.  Congress had provided\na remedy for discrimination claims by federal employees in 42\nU. S. C. §2000e-16.  The plaintiff missed the deadline for\njudicial review of the administrative determination of his claim,\nand he tried to evade that requirement by invoking the general\nemployment discrimination statute.  See Brown, supra, at 823-\n824.  Quoting Preiser, Brown held that the balance struck by\nCongress could not be evaded merely by attaching a different\nlabel.  Id., at 832-833.  “It would require the suspension of\ndisbelief to ascribe to Congress the design to allow its careful\nand thorough remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful\npleading.”  Id., at 833.  “In a variety of contexts the Court has\nheld that a precisely drawn, detailed statute preempts more\ngeneral remedies.”  Id., at 834 (citing Preiser, along with cases\non Federal Tort Claims Act, Suits in Admiralty Act, and venue\nrequirements in patent cases).  A specific remedy may be\ncumulative rather than exclusive when the language or history\nof the statute indicates that intent, see id., at 833-834, but\nneither the habeas statute in Preiser nor the employment statute\nin Brown fell in that category.  See id., at 835.  In each case, the\nspecific remedy was exclusive, and the plaintiff could not\ninvoke the general one, even though the specific one was no\nlonger available to him.\nIn the cases since Preiser, the line between §1983 and\nhabeas has not always been easy to draw, but two consistent\nthemes emerge.  Section 1983 may not be used to obtain release\nfrom custody directly, nor may it be used to prevent the state\nfrom carrying out the judgment as entered.\nIn Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 554-555 (1974),\n§1983 was not available to restore good time credits, but it was\navailable  for  injunctive  relief  and  damages  for  improper\n\n14\nprocedures for revocation of good time.  An injunction requir-\ning certain procedures in a good time revocation hearing does\nnot prevent the state from carrying out its judgment.  The\nprison merely needs to hold a new hearing, and the prisoner\nmeanwhile remains in prison.  Similarly, Gerstein v. Pugh, 420\nU. S. 103, 107, n. 6 (1975), permitted injunctive relief regard-\ning pretrial detention hearings.  Release was not asked, and\nthere was not yet any state court judgment to interfere with.\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 478-479 (1994) involved\na suit for damages by a prisoner who claimed his conviction\nwas invalid but whose challenges to that conviction on appeal\nand in habeas corpus had been rejected.  The majority avoided\nthe collision between §1983 and habeas by reading into §1983\na requirement that if a claim necessarily implies invalidity of\nthe conviction or sentence, the state judgment must be actually\nset aside in other proceedings before a §1983 suit can proceed.\nSee id., at 486-487.  This rule precludes the possibility that a\nprisoner could evade the habeas exhaustion requirement (and,\nsince AEDPA, the deference standard) by getting a §1983\njudgment that resolves the validity of the criminal judgment\nand then attacking the criminal judgment in state court with a\nclaim that federal judgment must be given preclusive effect.\nJustice Souter concurred in the judgment, joined by three\nother  Justices.    He  noted  that  an  action  for  damages  for\nunlawful confinement “would, practically, compel the State to\nrelease the prisoner.”  Id., at 498.  Preiser therefore applied,\nand requires “a state prisoner challenging the lawfulness of his\nconfinement to follow habeas’s rules before seeking §1983\ndamages . . . .”  Ibid.  Under either approach, §1983 cannot be\nused to prevent a state from carrying out its criminal judgment.\nCertiorari from this Court and habeas in the lower federal\ncourts are the exclusive means Congress has provided for that\npurpose.\nThree recent cases have applied the Preiser/Heck rule to\nprison discipline proceedings.  In Edwards v. Balisok, 520\nU. S. 641 (1997), the prisoner sought declaratory relief and\n\n15\ndamages for alleged due process violations in the revocation of\ngood-time credit, where the violations alleged would necessar-\nily have rendered the revocation invalid.  See id., at 643, 648.\nThe claim was therefore not cognizable under §1983 despite\nthe facts that the prisoner did not seek release and that the claim\nwent to procedure rather than substance of the revocation.  See\nid., at 645.  Injunctive relief might be available, however, to\nenjoin future due process violations.  See id., at 648-649.  The\nCourt also noted that the §1983 suit must be dismissed, not\nstayed, to the extent it was precluded.  See id., at 649.\nIn contrast, Muhammad v. Close, 540 U. S. 749, 752-753\n(2004) (per curiam) was a suit for damages for retaliatory\nprosecution of a charge on which the prisoner was acquitted.\nHe did not challenge his discipline on another charge, on which\nhe was convicted.  See id., at 753.  Because the claim could not\nhave any effect on the time served, there was no basis for\nhabeas relief, and the Heck rule was inapplicable.  See id., at\n754-755.\nWilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 1248,\n161 L. Ed. 2d 253, 262 (2005) reviewed the cases and summa-\nrized the rule “that a state prisoner’s §1983 action is barred\n(absent prior invalidation)—no matter the relief sought . . . , no\nmatter the target of the prisoner’s suit . . . —if success in that\naction would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confine-\nment or its duration.”  Because the prisoners sought only new\nparole hearings, at which the authorities could deny parole,\nvalidity of confinement or its duration was not at issue, and\n§1983 relief was not precluded.  See id., 125 S. Ct., at 1248,\n161 L. Ed. 2d, at 263.\nAll of these cases are decided in the context of convictions\nfor noncapital felonies punished by incarceration.  Fact and\nduration of confinement, in this context, is equivalent to the\nability of the state to enforce its criminal judgment.  In each\ncase where the state can continue to keep the prisoner in prison\nfor the full duration that it would have imprisoned him without\n\n16\nfederal court action, the §1983 case can proceed.  Where the\noutcome would result in a shorter duration of confinement,\nthereby altering the outcome of the state’s criminal processes,\nhabeas corpus is the exclusive federal remedy.\nTranslated  into  the  realm  of  capital  punishment,  the\nequivalent of “release from confinement or a shorter stay in\nprison,” see ibid. (emphasis added), is removal of the death\nsentence or delay in its execution.  Just as a noncapital felon is\nbarred from §1983 if his claim would result in one day less in\nprison, so the capital murderer is barred if success would mean\none day more delay in the state’s execution of its judgment.\nWe will return to this point in discussing the Nelson case infra,\nat 19-20, but first some background on habeas corpus and\nmethod-of-execution claims is necessary.\nB.  Habeas and Method of Execution.\nUnder  Preiser,  the  threshold  question  in  determining\nwhether a §1983 action is cognizable is simply one of whether\nthe claim lies within the scope of habeas corpus.  Although the\nuse of habeas to litigate method of execution claims “may lack\na perfect historical pedigree,” cf. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.\n478,  496  (1986)  (cause  and  prejudice  test  for  procedural\ndefault), it is well established at this point.  In the usual habeas\ncase, the prisoner is contending that he should not have been\nconvicted at all, and hence should not have been imprisoned at\nall, or else that his sentence of incarceration is too long and he\nshould be released sooner.  Hence, the dispute is typically\nstated as a challenge to the fact or duration of confinement.\nSee, e.g., Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 527 (2002); see also\nMuhammad, 540 U. S., at 750 (“Challenges to the validity of\nany confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the\nprovince of habeas corpus . . . ”).  In challenges to the penalty\nphase of a capital case, the prisoner is contending that he\nshould have been sentenced to life in prison, and so in a sense\nit is the prisoner who is arguing for a longer confinement than\nthe state wishes to impose.  Even so, penalty phase claims have\n\n17\nbeen routinely reviewed on habeas throughout the modern\ncapital punishment era.  See, e.g., Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668, 698-699 (1984).  Congress enacted its most\nrecent reforms of habeas corpus with capital cases as its central\nfocus, see 141 Cong. Rec. 15018 (1995) (statement of Sen.\nSpecter), and it did not eliminate the penalty phase litigation, so\nit must have intended that this practice continue.\nReview of method of execution on habeas goes back at\nleast to In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436 (1890), an Eighth\nAmendment challenge to electrocution.  The Court denied an\napplication for writ of error because the decision below was “so\nplainly right,” id., at 447, i.e., on the merits, without any hint\nthat habeas was an incorrect procedure.  Kemmler arose on\nstate habeas, so the Court would not necessarily have com-\nmented on the procedure if the state courts did not, but the\nsame year the Court denied federal habeas on the same ground\nin Jugiro v. Brush, 140 U. S. 686 (1890).  The Court sum-\nmarily affirmed by citing Kemmler, a merits decision.  In the\nmodern era, Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern\nDist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653, 653 (1992) (per curiam) clearly\ncontemplates that habeas is available for a method of execution\nclaim, and at least hinting if not holding that habeas is the\nexclusive remedy.  In Stewart v. LaGrand, 526 U. S. 115\n(1999) (per curiam), a method of execution claim was decided\non habeas on the basis of well-established habeas doctrine, with\nno question of the applicability of the procedure.  See id., at\n119 (citing Teague  v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) and Coleman\nv. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991)).  Of course, the\nunexplained and unchallenged exercise of jurisdiction does not\nform a precedent which is binding in a case where the question\nis squarely presented, see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352,\nn. 2 (1996), but the long history of the exercise of this jurisdic-\ntion does at least illustrate that method of execution claims are\nestablished and accepted as being within the scope of habeas\ncorpus.\n\n18\nThe fact that Florida changed its method of execution to\nlethal injection after Hill’s first federal petition was completed\nraises a question of whether habeas is a practical remedy for\nlitigating a changed method.  The Court’s interpretation of both\nthe successive petition and statute of limitations provisions of\nAEDPA indicate that it is.\nThe habeas statute of limitations begins on the latest of\nseveral events, one of which is “the date on which the factual\npredicate of the claim or claims presented could have been\ndiscovered through the exercise of due diligence.”  28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d)(1)(D).  Johnson v. United States, 544 U. S. 295, 125\nS. Ct. 1571, 1579, 161 L. Ed. 2d 542, 553-554 (2005) gave a\npractical construction to the parallel language of §2255 to\ninclude a “necessary condition for relief,” in that case the\nvacatur of a prior conviction.  A prisoner in Hill’s situation\ncould hardly ask for relief from a method of execution before\nits adoption, so by analogy to Johnson the one-year clock began\nrunning when Florida changed its method.\nThe successive petition limitation has also been interpreted\nflexibly  enough  to  accommodate  this  situation.    If  a  first\npetition is dismissed as unexhausted, a new petition following\nexhaustion is not subject to the “second or successive petition”\nrule of 28 U. S. C. §2244(b), even though it literally fits that\ndescription.  See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 488 (2000).\nSimilarly, a claim of mental incompetence to be executed\npreviously dismissed as unripe could be reasserted when it\nbecame ripe.  See Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637,\n644-645 (1998).\nHill could have filed a federal habeas petition challenging\nFlorida’s method of execution within one year of its adoption,\nplus tolling for any time a properly filed state petition was\npending.  Instead, he waited five years, after the federal statute\nhad run, and after the death warrant had been signed, raising a\nprocedural bar under clearly established state law.  See supra,\nat 4-5.  Habeas corpus is available for method-of-execution\nclaims when it is diligently sought, but it is not available when\n\n19\nthe claims are held in reserve to spring on the courts at the last\nminute to stop a scheduled execution.\nC.  Nelson v. Campbell.\nAlthough all previous method-of-execution cases in this\nCourt had been resolved on habeas or by applying habeas\nprinciples,  the  Court  allowed  a  §1983  suit  in  Nelson  v.\nCampbell, 541 U. S. 637 (2004).  The Court was careful to\ncharacterize its holding as “extremely limited,” id., at 649, and\nnot resolving the issue regarding “method-of-execution claims\ngenerally.”  Id., at 644.\nNelson involved a controversy over the use of a “cut-down”\nprocedure for execution of an inmate whose veins were not\naccessible in the usual manner.  See id., at 640-641.  This\nsituation  was  distinguishable  from  the  usual  method-of-\nexecution claim, because “the gravamen of petitioner’s entire\nclaim is that use of the cut-down would be gratuitous.”  Id., at\n645  (emphasis  in  original).  Most  importantly,  the  Court\ndistinguished  cases  seeking  to  enjoin  executions,  noting,\n“Petitioner has alleged alternatives that, if they had been used,\nwould have allowed the State to proceed with the execution as\nscheduled.”  Id., at 646 (emphasis added).\nIn other words, the Court believed that issuance of the\nrequested injunction would have permitted the state to complete\nthe execution of the judgment in the criminal case on the day it\nwould have done so without federal court action.6  This places\nNelson in the same category of Muhammad and Wilkinson.  See\nsupra, at 15.\nIn practice, allowing such attacks on the State’s standard\nmethod of execution in last-minute §1983 litigation will impact\nthe enforcement of criminal judgments.  Unless every inmate\nis going to be allowed to specify his individual execution\n6. The actual aftermath of Nelson, to be described in the amicus brief of\nAlabama, is a different story.\n\n20\nmethod, the state will have to defend its standard protocol.\nHearing  that  challenge  will  typically  mean  a  stay  of  the\nexecution, as happened in this case.  Also, as in this case, it will\ntypically mean further delay of justice which is already very\nlong overdue.  The Preiser line of cases says that habeas is the\nexclusive remedy if success means interference with the state’s\ncriminal judgment, see supra, at 15, but “success” in the capital\ncontext can include a stay of execution, even if the state\nultimately prevails.  “Each delay, for its span, is a commutation\nof a death sentence to one of imprisonment.”  Thompson v.\nWainwright, 714 F. 2d 1495, 1506 (CA11 1983).\nNelson should be limited to its unusual facts.  Challenge to\nthe State’s standard method of execution should be through\nhabeas corpus.  When the method is unchanged throughout the\nproceedings,  habeas  requires  exhaustion  of  state  remedies\nbefore the first federal habeas petition and then raising the\nclaim in that petition.  Otherwise, the claim is barred.\nWhen, as in this case, the State changes methods after the\nfirst federal petition, the inmate must still invoke state reme-\ndies, if there are any, at the appropriate time.  Hill did not do\nso, and his claim is defaulted.  See supra, at 4-5.  A claim\nunder the Civil Rights Act does not lie, and there is no point\nconverting this proceeding to a habeas petition.\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit should be affirmed.\nApril 2006\nRespectfully submitted,\nKENT S.

Respondents  have  not  advanced  a \ncomprehensible argument for denying Mr. Hill a forum to \nadjudicate  his  Eighth  Amendment  claim.    Nor  does  the \namicus brief of the States offer a principled legal justification \nfor  that  result.1    The  United  States  at  least  attempts  to \n                                                 \n1 The States offer “a cautionary tale” to argue for abandonment of \nthe rule this Court unanimously announced in Nelson v. Campbell, \n541 U.S. 637 (2004).  The tale they tell is one about supposed \n“abuse” by Nelson in proceedings on remand from this Court.  Of \ncourse, if any such “abuse” occurs, the district court has equitable \ndiscretion to hold that Nelson (or any other § 1983 plaintiff) is \ndisentitled to relief under Gomez v. United States District Court \nfor the Northern District of California, 503 U.S. 653 (1992) (per \ncuriam) – a point this Court made explicitly in Nelson, 541 U.S. at \n649.    In  fact,  however,  amici’s  description  of  the  remand \nproceedings in Nelson is a gross distortion.  Nelson has not altered \nhis  position  on  remand.    As  this  Court  recognized,  Nelson’s \nposition from the outset included challenges to the “cut-down” \nprocedure  “as  well  as  the  warden’s refusal to  provide reliable \ninformation regarding the . . . protocol.”  Id. at 645-46.  On remand \nNelson has continued to assert that central line placement is a \nconstitutional  way  to  execute  him;  he  has  sought  only  the \ninformation needed to assure it is done by qualified personnel \nunder proper conditions.  See Hearing Tr. 8, Nelson v. Campbell, \nNo. 2:03-CV-1008-T (M.D. Ala. Oct. 6, 2004).  The sole reason \nthe  Nelson  litigation  remains  unresolved  is  because  Alabama \nofficials  have  refused  to  prepare  a  protocol  that  specifies  the \nprocedure so that it can be evaluated medically.  Moreover, amici’s \n“cautionary  tale,”  which  is  crafted  to  convince  this  Court that \nNelson has created a device for obstructing executions in Alabama, \nnotably  fails  to  disclose  that  Alabama’s  Attorney  General  has \nmoved to set six execution dates since the decision in Nelson; all \n \n\n2 \nadvance legal arguments for denying Mr. Hill the right to \ninvoke § 1983 (or in the alternative to proceed in habeas), but \nits  position  rests  on  mischaracterizations  of  this  Court’s \ndecisions in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004), Slack \nv. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473 (2000), and Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637 (1998).   \nThe  long  and  short  of  it  is  that  Nelson  v.  Campbell \ncontrols here and entitles Mr. Hill to pursue his claims in a \n§ 1983 action.  As Nelson recognized, “[a] suit seeking to \nenjoin a particular means of effectuating a sentence of death” \nis a proper § 1983 action because it “does not directly call \ninto question the ‘fact’ or ‘validity’ of the sentence itself – by \nsimply  altering its method of execution, the State can  go \nforward with the sentence.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644.  Mr. \nHill advances precisely such a claim.  Nor is there any reason \nto deny Mr. Hill a § 1983 cause of action on the theory that \nhis  § 1983  proceeding  constitutes  an  evasion  of  the \nlimitations imposed on habeas petitions.  Even if brought as a \nhabeas action, his Eighth Amendment claim could not be \ncharacterized as a second or successive petition under Slack \nand Martinez-Villareal because it did not ripen until after Mr. \nHill’s first federal habeas proceedings ended.  Respondents \nand the United States can dispute that conclusion only by \ntreating  the  dissents  in  Slack  and  Martinez-Villareal  as \nthough they were the opinions of the Court. \n                                                 \nof those executions were carried out; in none of them did the \ninmate  scheduled  for  execution  file  a  § 1983  challenge  to  the \nmethod of execution.  See Alabama Dep’t of Corrections, Inmates \nExecuted  in  Alabama,  available  at \n<http://www.doc.state.al.us/execution.htm> (last visited Apr. 16, \n2006) (listing prisoners executed in Alabama and their dates of \nexecution). \n \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.  MR. HILL’S CLAIM IS PROPERLY BROUGHT \nUNDER § 1983. \n1.    Neither  respondents  nor  their  amici  offer  any \npersuasive reason for refusing to allow Mr. Hill to pursue his \nEighth  Amendment  claim  in  a  § 1983  action.    Although \nrespondents suggest that all challenges to procedures used to \ncarry out lethal injections are at the “core” of habeas (Fla. Br. \n22-23)  and  therefore  prohibited  in  § 1983  actions,  that \ncontention  ignores  virtually  everything  the  Court  said  in \nNelson  v.  Campbell,  as  well  as  decades  of  this  Court’s \njurisprudence.  See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242 \n(2005); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994); Presier v. \nRodriquez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973). \nFor its part, the United States at least acknowledges the \nwell-established  law  set  forth  in  Preiser  and  its  progeny, \nwhich dictates that § 1983 is unavailable only for challenges \nto  the  fact  or  duration  of  an  inmate’s  sentence  –  i.e., \nchallenges  that,  if  successful,  would  invalidate  (or \nnecessarily imply the invalidity of) a sentence.  See U.S. Br. \n9-11, 12-13.  As the United States recognizes in theory, a \nchallenge  to  the  particulars  of  a  State’s  lethal  injection \nprocedure  falls  within  the  category  of  claims  that  may \nproperly be brought in a § 1983 action.  If successful, such a \nchallenge  does  not  “necessarily  prevent  [the  State]  from \ncarrying out its execution,” Nelson, 541 U.S. at 647, because \n“by simply altering its method of execution, the State can go \nforward with the sentence,” id. at 644.  See U.S. Br. 12-13, \n18-19.  In contrast, the category of challenges that must be \nbrought in habeas proceedings comprises those cases “where \na prisoner contends that execution per se constitutes cruel \nand unusual punishment – i.e., that the particular method of \nexecution being contemplated by the State and any other \nmethod of execution would be unconstitutional.”  U.S. Br. 13. \n \n\n4 \nMr.  Hill’s  challenge  is  indisputably  in  the  former \ncategory.    He  does  not  contend  that  “execution  per  se \nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment.”  Id.  He does not \nseek  relief  “permanently  enjoin[ing]  the  use  of  lethal \ninjection” or relief that would require “statutory amendment \nor  variance”  before  the  State  could  carry  out  a  lethal \ninjection.  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644.  Nor would the relief Mr. \nHill seeks necessarily imply the invalidity of his sentence.  \nUnder the well-established law reflected in Nelson, therefore, \nMr. Hill has a right to invoke § 1983.2   \n2.    The  United  States  nevertheless  contends  that  Mr. \nHill’s claim should be treated as though it were in the latter \ncategory  and  relegated  exclusively  to  habeas.    That \ncounterintuitive result is dictated, the United States contends, \nby the fact that Mr. Hill’s complaint “nowhere specifically \nidentified  an  alternative  method  by  which  he  could \npermissibly be executed.”  U.S. Br. 14.  But it has never been \n                                                 \n2 The United States seeks to distinguish Nelson from Mr. Hill’s \ncase on grounds that cannot withstand the slightest scrutiny.  The \nUnited States describes as an “essential” feature of Nelson that the \ncut-down  procedure  Nelson  challenged  could  have  been \nchallenged by a prisoner had Alabama sought to use it “for the \npurposes of medical treatment.”  U.S. Br. 12.  That factor does not \ndistinguish Mr. Hill’s case because an inmate could use § 1983 to \nchallenge  the  reckless  administration  of  torturous,  medically \nunsound anesthetic or other drugs as a medical treatment.  Nor is \nthe United States correct that an inquiry into whether an inmate’s \nclaim  for  relief  would  “necessarily  prevent  [the  State]  from \ncarrying out its” sentence is applicable only to so-called “hybrid” \ncases, and not to direct challenges to lethal injection procedures.  \nSee U.S. Br. 16-18.  In Nelson, the Court stated unambiguously \nthat “[i]n the present context [i.e. a challenge to a lethal injection \nprocedure],  focusing  attention  on  whether  [the]  petitioner’s \nchallenge . . . would necessarily prevent Alabama from carrying \nout its execution” was the appropriate test for deciding whether the \ninmate could pursue his claim in a § 1983 action.  541 U.S. at 647. \n \n\n5 \nthe  law  that  plaintiffs  invoking  § 1983  to  challenge  the \nconstitutionality of the manner in which their sentences are \ncarried out must propose a specific constitutional alternative, \nor must instead proceed in habeas if they do not.  Nor should \nthe Court adopt any such rule now.   \nFirst, because the courts below dismissed this case on the \npleadings,  the  dismissal  can  be  upheld  on  the  ground \nproposed by the United States only if this Court requires \n§ 1983 plaintiffs challenging execution procedures to specify \na constitutional alternative in their complaints.  Even if such \na  change  in  pleading  rules  were  desirable,  it  could  not \nproperly  or  fairly  be  ordered  judicially  to  apply \nretrospectively,  but  is  instead  “a  result  which  must  be \nobtained  by  the  process  of  amending  the  Federal  Rules.”  \nLeatherman  v.  Tarrant  County  Narcotics  Intelligence  & \nCoordination  Unit,  507  U.S.  163,  168  (1993);  see  also \nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002). \nSecond, requiring a plaintiff to set forth a constitutionally \nacceptable alternative would be antithetical to this Court’s \ninsistence  that  courts  adjudicating  § 1983  cases  must \npreserve the discretion of state officials regarding how to \nchange  procedures  in  response  to  a  finding  of \nunconstitutionality.    As  this  Court  has  explained,  “strong \nconsiderations of comity . . . require giving the States the \nfirst opportunity to correct the errors made in the internal \nadministration of their prisons.”  See Lewis v. Casey, 518 \nU.S. 343, 362-64  (1996).  Rather than forcing a State to \naccept a § 1983 plaintiff’s preferred procedure, the proper \ncourse is to “refrain[ ] from ‘dictat[ing] precisely what course \nthe State should follow’” and “‘charg[ing] the Department of \nCorrection with the task of devising a Constitutionally sound \n[alternative].’”  Id. at 362 (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. \n817, 818-19 (1977)).  There is no reason why that principle \nof deference to state administrative discretion – which the \n \n\n6 \nUnited States ignores – should apply any differently in the \npresent context. \nThird, the approach suggested by the United States would \nundermine the clarity and predictability of the established \nrule for deciding when cases must be brought in habeas.  The \napplication  of  that  rule  to  Mr.  Hill’s  complaint  is \nstraightforward.  Because he does not challenge the fact or \nduration of his sentence or advance any claim that asserts its \ninvalidity – indeed, his complaint expressly disclaims any \ncontention  that  Florida  is  constitutionally  forbidden  to \nexecute him by lethal injection – he is entitled to proceed \nunder § 1983.  What the United States proposes is that his \nclaim  be  treated  as  though  it  were  a  “fact  or  duration” \nchallenge because the practical effect of adjudicating it may \nbe to delay his execution.  The Court unanimously rejected \nexactly the same argument in Nelson.  As Nelson explained, \n“focusing  attention  on  whether  petitioner’s  challenge  .  .  . \nwould  necessarily  prevent  Alabama  from  carrying  out  its \nexecution  both  protects  against  the  use  of  § 1983  to \ncircumvent  any  limits  imposed  by  the  habeas  statute  and \nminimizes  the  extent  to  which  the  fact  of  the  prisoner’s \nimminent execution will require differential treatment of his \notherwise cognizable § 1983 claims.”  541 U.S. at 647.3 \n                                                 \n3  In  the  face  of  this  clear  holding,  there  is  no  basis  for  the \ncontention of the United States that “the fact of the prisoner’s \nimminent execution” should be viewed as barring “his otherwise \ncognizable  § 1983  claims.”    Nelson  explained  that  the  district \ncourts’ equitable authority under Gomez would suffice to police \nabuse (see note 1 supra) and that plaintiffs challenging execution \nprocedures under § 1983 would be constrained by the requirements \nof the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3626.  \nSee Nelson, 541 U.S. at 649-50.  As Nelson indicates, there is no \nreason also to substitute ad hoc analysis of the kind the United \nStates proposes for the clear rule of Preiser and its progeny. \n \n\n7 \nFourth,  the  United  States  is  simply  incorrect  in  its \nassertion that requiring inmates such as Mr. Hill to specify a \nconstitutionally acceptable alternative is necessary to ensure \nthat they do not thwart execution “by challenging individual \nmethods of execution seriatim.” U.S. Br. 16.  As with any \nother  § 1983  challenge,  the  State  has  two  options  when \nconfronted with a claim that a particular execution procedure \nviolates the Eighth Amendment:  it can dispute the claim or it \ncan propose an alternative that eliminates the basis for the \nobjection.    If  the  State  chooses  to  defend  the  challenged \nprocedure and the trial court upholds it, the court’s judgment \ndisposes of the litigation and the execution goes forward.  If \nthe State chooses to put forward an alternative procedure, \neither the inmate will agree (and the case will be disposed of \nby  consent  decree)  or  the  case  will  be  contested  (and \ndisposed of by court order).  Either way, the challenge will \nbe resolved in a manner that is no different from a case in \nwhich a plaintiff affirmatively pleads a specific alternative.  \nOnly if the State continues to put forward alternatives that the \ntrial  court  finds  to  be  unconstitutional  will  the  litigation \ncontinue in seriatim fashion.4 \n                                                 \n4 Given the constitutional options available to the State for carrying \nout execution by lethal injection, see, e.g., Morales v. Hickman, \n415 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th \nCir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006), there is no reason to \nbelieve that seriatim challenges will prevent lawful executions. In \nMorales,  for  example,  the  district  court  determined  that \nCalifornia’s protocol did not comport with the Eighth Amendment \nunless modified in one of two critical respects.  See Morales, 415 \nF. Supp. 2d at 1047-48.  When the State modified the protocol in a \nmanner consistent with the court’s order, Morales challenged the \nrevised protocol.  The District Court rejected Morales’s challenge, \nfinding the protocol, as revised, constitutional.  See Morales v. \nHickman, No. 06-219JF (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2006); see also Baze \nv. Rees, No. 04-CI-01094 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 8, 2005) (finding \n \n\n8 \nTo be sure, in Nelson, the Court mentioned the alternative \nprocedure alleged by the inmate in that case.  But Nelson’s \nallegations  merely  confirmed  that  he  did  not  seek  to \nchallenge the validity of his death sentence, given that his \ncomplaint requested injunctive relief that could have been \nconstrued as barring his execution entirely.  See 541 U.S. at \n648; see also id. at 647 (questioning whether the prayer for \nrelief “transformed his conditions of confinement claim into \na challenge to the validity of his death sentence”).  Where, as \nhere, an inmate makes clear that the challenge is neither to \nthe death sentence per se nor to the State’s chosen method of \nlethal injection, but only to specific procedures, the inmate \nneed not plead an alternative procedure to bring the claim \nwithin Nelson.5 \nII. THERE IS NO OTHER GROUND FOR DENYING \nMR. HILL ACCESS TO A § 1983 FORUM FOR HIS \nEIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM. \nThere  is  no  merit  to  any  of  the  remaining  reasons \nadvanced by respondents and the United States for denying \n                                                 \njugular vein access unconstitutional but upholding lethal injection \nthrough peripheral vein access).   \n5 Although the question of how to bring “general” method-of-\nexecution claims is not presented here, the logic of this Court’s \ncases suggests that such claims are congnizable under § 1983.  In \nDotson  the  Court  made  clear  that  the  “implied  exception”  to \n§ 1983’s coverage is limited to claims that lie “within the core of \nhabeas corpus,” Dotson, 125 S. Ct at 1247 (internal quotation \nomitted), and in Nelson, this Court noted that method of execution \nchallenges  “fall  at  the  margins  of  habeas,”  541  U.S.  at  646.  \nMoreover, requiring “general” method of execution claims to be \nbrought in habeas would force district courts to confront threshold \nissues  as  to  whether  a  particular  challenge  is  “general”  or \n“specific,” eschewing the clarity and efficiency that would result \nfrom adopting Nelson’s bright line for all method of execution \nclaims. \n \n\n9 \nMr. Hill the right to pursue his Eighth Amendment claim in a \n§ 1983 action. \n1.    The  Eleventh  Circuit  cannot  be  affirmed  on  the \nground that Mr. Hill failed to satisfy the requirement of the \nPrison  Litigation  Reform  Act  (“PLRA”)  that  he  exhaust \nadministrative remedies before bringing his § 1983 action.  \nRespondents do not raise exhaustion as an alternative ground \nfor affirmance in this Court, and they have never suggested \nthat  administrative  remedies  are  available  to  Mr.  Hill.  \nBecause  the  requirement  is  not  jurisdictional,  it  has  been \nwaived.6  It certainly should not be considered at the behest \nof an amicus when the party defending the judgment has not \nraised it – especially where the amicus does not even try to \nidentify the specific administrative procedure that Mr. Hill \nshould have exhausted prior to filing his complaint. \nNotably,  Mr.  Hill’s  complaint  alleged  that  no \nadministrative remedies were available to him.  See J.A. 17-\n18.  In response, the State alleged only that “Hill has not \nidentified  what  administrative  remedies  he  claims  he  has \nexhausted.”  J.A. 25 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)).  The State \ndid not identify any unexhausted procedures available to Mr. \nHill.  The PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is not a rule of \npleading  the  plaintiff  must  satisfy.    It  is  an  affirmative \n                                                 \n6 See Anderson v. XYZ Corr. Health Servs., Inc., 407 F.3d 674, 677 \n(4th Cir. 2005); Richardson v. Goord, 347 F.3d 431, 433-34 (2d \nCir. 2003) (per curiam); Steele v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 355 F.3d \n1204, 1206 (10th Cir. 2003); Ali v.

Nor  can  the  Eleventh  Circuit  be  affirmed  on  the \nground that Mr. Hill is disentitled to relief under Gomez v. \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of \nCalifornia, 503 U.S. 653 (1992) (per curiam).  To begin with, \nthat is not a matter for this Court at the present juncture.  It is \na matter for the district court to consider on remand after this \nCourt corrects the erroneous holding of both courts below \nthat the district court lacked jurisdiction in the case.  See \nNelson,  541  U.S.  at  648.    As  Nelson  made  clear,  any \nequitable considerations are to be assessed by the district \ncourt in the first instance.  See 541 U.S. at 649-50; cf. Padilla \nv. Hanft, __ S. Ct. __, No. 05-533, 2006 WL 845383, at *2 \n(Apr. 3, 2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (it is the province of \n                                                 \n7 See Anderson, 407 F.3d at 681; Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, \n1119 (9th Cir. 2003); Casanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 77 (1st \nCir. 2002); Ray v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 295 (3d Cir. 2002); Foulk \nv.

California, 543 U.S. \n499 (2005) (assuming that the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is \nwaivable); id. at 528 n.1 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (pointing out \nassumption); Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262, 267 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (suggesting  that  exhaustion  is  an  affirmative \ndefense). \n8 Had respondents pleaded the defense in the district court, that \ncourt would have had to determine whether the State had in fact \nshown that Mr. Hill had administrative remedies available to him.  \nSee Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 736 n.4 (2001) (“Without the \npossibility  of  some  relief,  the  administrative  officers  would \npresumably  have  no  authority  to  act  on  the  subject  of  the \ncomplaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust.”).  Given \nthat no one so far has even attempted to point this Court to any \navailable administrative procedure, it is highly unlikely that the \nState could have made the requisite showing. \n \n \n\n11 \nthe district court, in the course of its supervision of a case, to \nguard  against  any  abuses  of  the  judicial  system  by  the \nparties). \nIn any event, Mr. Hill diligently pursued his claim as \nsoon as it ripened.  His claim was not ripe before his death \nwarrant  issued,  because  it  was  only  at  that  time  that  the \nFlorida Department of Corrections (“DOC”) was obliged to \nbegin planning to conduct his execution, and only at that \npoint that Mr. Hill could attempt to ascertain the specific \nmeans  by  which  the  State  meant  to  carry  out  his  lethal \ninjection.  See Worthington v. Missouri, 166 S.W. 3d 566, \n583 n.3 (Mo. 2005).  That is the case in Florida because the \nDOC retains complete discretion over how lethal injections \nwill be carried out, and it shrouds its intentions in secrecy. \nNo  statute  specifies  the  chemicals  or  the  injection \nsequence  to  be  used,  the  procedures  for  performing  the \ninjection, any qualifications or training required for persons \nengaged in administering the chemicals and monitoring the \nexecution, or the means of venous access.9  Nor does the \nFlorida lethal injection statute – or any other provision of \nFlorida  law  –  require  that  such  procedures  be  devised \nthrough a rule-making process, or even in consultation with \n                                                 \n9 In contrast, Florida prescribes, with careful detail, the chemicals \nto  be  used  in  animal  euthanasia  and  the  chemicals  that  are \nprohibited for such use (including any neuromuscular blocking \nagent); a strict “order of preference” for the manner in which the \nlethal  solution  is  to  be  administered;  the  qualifications  that  a \nperson administering the lethal solution must possess; and a 16-\nhour “euthanasia technician course” that anyone administering the \nlethal solution must have taken.  See Fla. Stat. § 828.058.  The \nstatute goes on to detail the minimum topics that the certification \ncourse must cover (including pharmacology, proper administration \nand storage of euthanasia solutions) and the manner in which the \ncurriculum for the course is to be approved (by the Board of \nVeterinary Medicine).  See id. § 828.058(4)(a).   \n \n\n12 \nmedical experts.10  And the DOC itself has not published any \nstable set of procedures through rule-making or otherwise.  \nThe DOC retains total discretion to change at any time and \nwith  respect  to  any  particular  execution  the  chemical \nsequence, the manner of its administration, the qualifications \nand training of the  execution team, and any provisions it \nmight (or might not) adopt to ensure proper administration \nand adequate anesthetic depth. \nThe United States does not dispute that the DOC has total \ndiscretion  in  these  regards.    Instead,  the  United  States \nsuggests that Mr. Hill could not “presume” that the DOC \nwould exercise that discretion prior to his execution and that \nhe should instead be required to assume that the State would \nuse the procedures revealed in litigation six years earlier in \nSims v. State, 754 So.2d 657 (Fla. 2000).  See U.S. Br. 26 \nn.9.  That contention cannot be squared with this Court’s \nripeness doctrine. \nThe  “central  concern”  of  the  ripeness  doctrine  “is \nwhether  the  case  involves  uncertain  or  contingent  future \nevents that may not occur as anticipated.”  13A Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3532, at 112 \n(2d ed. 1984).  Accordingly, the ripeness inquiry looks to \nwhether a sufficiently concrete and definitive agency policy \nor  practice  exists.    Otherwise,  judicial  intervention  would \n“den[y] the agency an opportunity to correct its own mistakes \nand to apply its expertise.”  FTC v. Standard Oil Co., 449 \nU.S. 232, 242 (1980).  As this Court has explained in the \nanalogous context of federal administrative review,  \n                                                 \n10 Compare Fla. Stat. § 828.055 (requiring the Board of Pharmacy \nto adopt rules for permits authorizing the use of chemicals in \nanimal euthanasia, which “shall set forth guidelines for the proper \nstorage and handling” of the chemicals); id. § 828.058 (requiring \ntraining for animal euthanasia technicians involving a curriculum \napproved by the Board of Veterinary Medicine). \n \n\n13 \n[T]he ripeness requirement is designed “to prevent \nthe  courts,  through  avoidance  of  premature \nadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract \ndisagreements over administrative policies, and also \nto protect the agencies from judicial interference until \nan administrative decision has been formalized and its \neffects  felt  in  a  concrete  way  by  the  challenging \nparties.” \nOhio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732-\n33 (1998) (citation omitted). \nHere, rather than promulgate a definitive policy, the DOC \nhas retained total discretion.  For this reason, it was only \nwhen  Mr.  Hill’s  execution  was  imminent  that  he  could \nattempt  to  ascertain  what  procedures  would  be  used  to \nexecute him.  Significantly, the DOC even then refused to \ndisclose  its  execution  protocol,  and  Florida’s  lawyers \nsuccessfully opposed Mr. Hill’s efforts to obtain the protocol \nthrough  public-records  requests  and  other  state-court \ndiscovery procedures, which requests the Florida Supreme \nCourt did not finally deny until January 17, 2006.  See Pet’r \nBr.  8-9.    The  State  cannot  fight  tooth  and  nail  to  resist \npublication  of  any  definitive  protocol  and  then  accuse  a \ncondemned person of inequitable conduct because he must \nwait  until  his  death  warrant  is  issued  to  ascertain  the \nparticular procedures that will be used in his execution. \nThe State could, however, secure an earlier resolution of \nany  challenges  to  its  execution  procedures  simply  by  the \norderly adoption of rules and their public disclosure.  The \nDOC could then properly insist that the question whether its \nchosen procedures for administering lethal injection violate \nthe Eighth Amendment be adjudicated before any individual \ninmate’s date of execution is set. \nGiven the lack of any constraints on the DOC’s discretion \nand the absence of any authoritative procedures that would \n \n\n14 \nhave provided the courts with a sufficiently concrete lethal \ninjection  process  to  review  before  Mr.  Hill’s  execution \nwarrant issued and the DOC began its preparations to execute \nhim, Mr. Hill’s claim did not ripen until that time.  And from \nthat moment forward, Mr. Hill diligently pursued his claim.  \nMr. Hill initially filed suit in state court, in order to defend \nagainst  an  argument  that  he  had  failed  to  exhaust  state \nremedies.11    As  soon  as  his  action  was  dismissed  on \nprocedural grounds in state court, he immediately filed his \n§ 1983 action. \nIII. MR. HILL CANNOT BE DENIED A FORUM ON \nTHE  THEORY  THAT  HIS  SUIT  SHOULD  BE \nRECHARACTERIZED  AS  A  SUCCESSIVE \nHABEAS PETITION.  \nThere is also no merit to the contention by respondents \nand some of their amici that Mr. Hill’s § 1983 complaint \nwould be subject to dismissal as a “second or successive” \nhabeas  petition  if  it  were  recharacterized  as  a  habeas \npleading.  Thus, even apart from Nelson v. Campbell, there is \nno conceivable justification for concluding that his § 1983 \nclaim is an impermissible end-run around the limitations on \nhabeas jurisdiction. \n1.  To begin with, the suggestion of the United States that \nthis  question  ought  not  be  considered  by  the  Court  is \nindefensible.  Respondents did not raise any objection to its \nconsideration and fully briefed the question (as did the State \namici).  That should be dispositive.  Cf. City of Springfield v. \nKibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 260 (1987) (refusing to reach claim \n                                                 \n11  Although  Mr.  Hill  was  not  required  to  exhaust  state-court \nremedies prior to bringing his federal-court action under § 1983, \nsee Dotson, 125 S. Ct. at 1249, he did so out of an abundance of \ncaution, recognizing that if the district court were to construe his \ncomplaint as a habeas filing, he would have had to exhaust those \njudicial remedies, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). \n \n\n15 \nonly because respondent objected “at the first point that she \nwas on notice that it was at issue”).  In any event, both the \ndistrict court and the Eleventh Circuit squarely addressed the \nquestion below.  See Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, \n501 U.S. 1083, 1099 n.8 (1991).  The district court held that \nthe petition was “the functional equivalent of a successive \npetition for writ of habeas corpus” and that petitioner “should \nhave first sought the permission of the Eleventh Circuit under \n28 U.S.C. § 2244 to file such a successive petition.”  J.A. 15.  \nThe court of appeals affirmed, holding that “the district court \nlacked jurisdiction to consider [Mr. Hill’s] claim because it is \nthe functional equivalent of a successive habeas petition and \nhe failed to obtain leave of this court to file it.”  J.A. 10. \nMoreover, the issue was fairly presented in the petition \nfor certiorari.  The petition characterized the Eleventh Circuit \nas  holding  that  “[a]ny  challenge  amounts  to  a  successive \nhabeas petition,” Pet. at 14-15, and it quoted the court of \nappeals’ holding that Mr. Hill’s claim was successive, see id. \nat 14-15. \nFinally, this issue is “inextricably linked” to the questions \nthat all concede are presented.  Invoking Preiser, respondents \nand the United States contend that Mr. Hill’s § 1983 claim \nshould be foreclosed because it is an attempt to avoid the \nrestrictions on habeas jurisdiction.  That contention invites \ninquiry into whether in fact the claim would be precluded in \nhabeas.  Thus, there is no justification for refusing to conduct \nthe inquiry.  See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 84-86 \n(1995); cf. City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y., \n125 S. Ct. 1478, 1490, n.8 (2005); Ballard v. Commissioner, \n125 S. Ct. 1270, 1275, n.2 (2005). \n2.  On the merits, lacking any case law to support their \nposition, respondents and the United States contend first that \nMr.  Hill’s  claims  are  barred  by  the  plain  language  of \nAEDPA.  Specifically, they assert that because Mr. Hill’s \nclaim is “successive,” it must satisfy both conditions set forth \n \n\n16 \nin  §  2244(b)(2)(B),  i.e.,  that  the  factual  predicate  for  the \nclaim could not have been discovered previously and that the \nclaim must demonstrate Mr. Hill’s innocence.  See U.S. Br. \n21-22;  Fla.  Br.  34-36.    But  that  argument  assumes  its \nconclusion.    AEDPA’s  textual  conditions  apply  only  to \n“second or successive” petitions.  They do not define (or \neven  purport  to  define)  what  constitutes  a  second  or \nsuccessive petition. \nSlack and Martinez-Villareal make that distinction clear.  \nIn  neither  case  could  the  habeas  petitioners  satisfy  either \ncondition of § 2244(b)(2)(B).  Yet the Court allowed the \nclaims  to  proceed,  holding  that  the  petitions  at  issue, \nalthough numerically second or successive, were not “second \nor successive” within the meaning of AEDPA.  In Slack, the \nCourt held that “[a] petition filed after a mixed petition has \nbeen dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before the district court \nadjudicated any claims is to be treated as ‘any other petition’ \nand is not a second or successive petition.”  529 U.S. at 487 \n(emphasis added).  Similarly, the Court held in Martinez-\nVillareal that “respondent’s Ford claim was not a ‘second or \nsuccessive’ petition under § 2244(b).”  523 U.S. at 645. \nThese decisions are dispositive of the question whether \nMr.  Hill’s  claim  is  “second  or  successive”  within  the \nmeaning of AEDPA.  Although the United States is correct \nthat those cases did not technically decide the precise issue \npresented here, they leave no doubt about how the issue here \nshould  be  resolved.    Martinez-Villareal  permits  the \nadjudication of a claim that ripened only after the first federal \npetition was denied.  The United States suggests that the \nCourt  simply  held  that  petitioner  was  entitled  to  an \nadjudication of all the claims presented in his first petition.  \nThat is not accurate.  The petitioner in Martinez-Villareal \nreceived an adjudication of all claims in his first petition – \nthe Ford claim was properly dismissed as unripe.  What the \nCourt actually held was that petitioner was entitled to a re-\n \n\n17 \nadjudication of his claim on the merits once it had ripened, \nwhich is all that Mr. Hill seeks here. \n Slack likewise did more than merely hold that a petition \nre-filed after dismissal of a so-called “mixed” petition is not a \n“second” petition – it also adopted pre-AEDPA case law as \nthe base-line for defining “second or successive.”  Justice \nKennedy’s opinion stated unambiguously that “[t]he phrase \n‘second  or  successive  petition’  is  a  term  of  art  given \nsubstance in our prior habeas corpus cases,” 529 U.S. at 486, \nand neither the United States nor Florida contends that, under \nthis Court’s “prior habeas corpus cases,” Mr. Hill’s petition \nwould be successive.  It is thus unsurprising that the courts of \nappeals have consistently relied on Martinez-Villareal and \nSlack to reject the precise position the United States advances \nhere.  See Pet’r Br. 35-36.  Cf. Johnson v. United States, 125 \nS.  Ct.  1571,  1579  (2005)  (rejecting  an  interpretation  of \nAEDPA under which “the statute of limitations may begin to \nrun  (and  even  expire)  before  the  § 2255  claim  and  its \nnecessary predicate even exist”). \nEven if Slack and Martinez-Villareal left any doubt on \nthe  matter,  there  is  little  to  recommend  the  approach \nadvanced by the United States (and, as noted, no case law to \nsupport it).  On this view, to avoid forfeiting federal review \nof an Eighth Amendment claim every habeas petitioner must \ninclude  in  his  first  federal  petition  a  challenge  to  every \nconceivable method of execution.  Thus, Mr. Hill would have \nto have challenged not only the gas chamber, hanging, and \nlethal  injection  (even  though  electrocution  was  Florida’s \nchosen method of execution), but also (for example) every \npossible  combination  of  chemicals  that  could  be  used  to \nimplement  lethal  injection,  or  risk  having  all  of  those \nchallenges lost forever.  Similarly, every prisoner, whether \nmentally competent or  not, would have to raise a plainly \nunripe Ford claim to guard against the possibility that he or \nshe will become incompetent by the time of his execution \n \n\n18 \n(when the claim first ripens).  And prisoners would have to \nanticipate a host of other claims that might arise after first \nfederal  habeas  was  over,  such  as  claims  under  Brady  v. \nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), which often arise after initial \nfederal habeas proceedings are completed (see, e.g., Banks v. \nDretke, 540 U.S. 668 (2004)).  Why Congress would have \nwanted to clutter first federal habeas petitions with such an \narray of hypothetical and unripe claims as a precondition for \ntheir  later  adjudication  once  they  had  ripened  is  never \nexplained. \nMoreover, as noted in Mr. Hill’s opening brief, such an \nargument is at odds with this Court’s prior understanding of \nsecond or successive petitions, which does not require the \nfutile act of filing an unripe claim merely to preserve it for \nlater.  Pet’r Br. at 33-34.  The United States chides Mr. Hill \nfor  relying  on  those  pre-AEDPA  decisions,  but  (as  noted \nabove) this Court squarely held that AEDPA used “second or \nsuccessive petition” as a “term of art” that drew substance \nfrom  “our  prior  habeas  corpus  cases.”    529  U.S.  at  486.  \nGiven that AEDPA itself contains no definition of “second or \nsuccessive,” it is hardly surprising that the Court looked to its \nprior decisions. \nIn truth, respondents and the United States do not seek to \napply  Slack  and  Martinez-Villareal  faithfully,  but  instead \nseek to repackage the dissents in those cases as the holdings \nof the Court.  But the Court squarely rejected the contention \nthat all claims that are numerically second or successive are \ngoverned  by  AEDPA’s  rules  for  “second  or  successive” \npetitions and adopted a more flexible understanding informed \nby pre-AEDPA case law.  Congress could have overturned \nthat interpretation if it had wanted to do so, but it has not.  \nThere is no basis for departing from those decisions now. \n3.    Bereft  of  a  convincing  argument  to  support  the \nEleventh Circuit’s dismissal of Mr. Hill’s habeas petition on \njurisdictional  grounds,  the  United  States  –  but  not \n \n\n19 \nrespondents – urges this Court to dismiss the claim as barred \nby  AEDPA’s  statute  of  limitations.    See  U.S.  Br.  24-27 \n(invoking 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)).  That position, which has \nnot  been  raised  by  any  court  or  party  throughout  this \nlitigation, provides no basis for resolving the petition here. \nThe  limitations  defense  is  not  jurisdictional.    It  is  an \naffirmative  defense  that  ordinarily  must  be  pled  and  is \nsubject to waiver.  The State has not raised the defense at any \nstage of this case. It would be altogether inappropriate for \nthis Court to take up the defense at the request of an amicus \nwhen the State has chosen not to raise it.12 \n                                                 \n12 In Day v. McDonough, 04-1324 (argued Feb. 27, 2006), this \nCourt is considering a district court’s authority to dismiss a habeas \npetition on limitations grounds even when the State has waived the \nissue.  Should the petitioner in Day prevail, the argument of the \nUnited States here would necessarily fail as well. \nBut even if a court may in some cases dismiss on limitations \ngrounds in the face of a State’s waiver, it would be inappropriate \nfor this Court to exercise that sort of discretion in the first instance \non the present record.  Among other things, limitations defenses \nsuch as those raised by the amicus often turn on an intensely \nfactual analysis.  Compare Pet’r Br. at 45-50, Day v. Crosby, No. \n04-1324 (U.S. filed Nov. 30, 2005) (no disputed facts with respect \nto tolling of limitations provision).  Mr. Hill’s case, for example, \npresents a strong case for equitable tolling, which the courts of \nappeals have agreed applies to AEDPA’s limitations provisions.  \nWhen there are facts to be determined and equities to be weighed, \nresolution by this Court on a motion to dismiss is inappropriate, \nparticularly when neither party has fully briefed the issue.  See \nLance  v.  Dennis,  126  S.  Ct.  1198,  1203  (2006)  (per  curiam) \n(reversing jurisdictional holding but remanding for district court to \naddress preclusion arguments in the first instance); id. (Ginsburg, \nJ., concurring) (noting that preclusion is “best left for full airing \nand decision on remand”). \n \n\n20 \nIn any event, the statute of limitations does not justify \ndismissal, for reasons discussed earlier in this Reply.  In Mr. \nHill’s situation, “the date on which the factual predicate of \nthe claim . . . presented could have been discovered through \nthe exercise of due diligence,” § 2244(d)(1)(D), is the same \nas the date on which the claim ripened:  the date when Mr. \nHill’s execution warrant issued.  Mr. Hill’s claim was thus \ntimely when filed, and § 2244(d)(1)(D) affords no basis for \ndismissing the petition. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \nDONALD B.

KAHN\nCLERK\nD.C. Docket No. 06-00032-CV-SPM\nCLARENCE E. HILL,\nPlaintiff-Appellant, \nversus\nJAMES MCDONOUGH,\nCHARLES CRIST,\nDefendants-Appellants.\n______________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Florida\n_____________\n(September 15, 2006)\nBefore TJOFLAT, HULL and PRYOR, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\n\nPetitioner Clarence E. Hill, currently an inmate on Florida’s death row,\nmoves this court for a stay of execution and expedited appeal of the dismissal of\nhis pending action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in which he alleges violations\nand threatened violations of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution.  We find that Hill does not meet the\nstandard for injunctive relief, and accordingly we deny his petition.\nThe basic facts of the underlying case resulting in Hill’s death sentence are\nset forth in the decision of the Florida Supreme Court affirming Hill’s conviction\nand death sentence on direct appeal.  Hill v. State, 515 So. 2d 176, 177 (Fla.\n1987).  Over the course of more than 20 years, Hill has pursued various\nunsuccessful appeals and collateral proceedings seeking to have his conviction\nand death sentence overturned.  On January 24, 2006, four days before his\nscheduled execution, Hill filed a civil complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In his\ncomplaint, Hill alleged that the particular three-drug lethal injection method used\nby Florida to carry out executions constituted cruel and unusual punishment in that\nthe administration of the first drug might insufficiently render the condemned\nprisoner unconscious.  Thus, a condemned prisoner might suffer severe pain\ncaused by the administration of the second and third drugs in the execution series.\n2\n\nThe day after Hill filed his complaint, the district court dismissed his claims\nfor lack of jurisdiction, holding that Hill’s action was effectively a successive\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus filed without leave and, thus, ran afoul of 28\nU.S.C. § 2244(b).  Hill v. Crosby, No. 4:06-CV-032-SPM, 2006 WL 167585, at\n*2–*3 (N.D. Fla. Jan. 21, 2006).  On appeal, this court affirmed, denying Hill’s\napplication for a stay.  Hill v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1084, 1085 (11th Cir. 2006).  The\nSupreme Court stayed the execution, granted certiorari and reversed, holding that\nHill’s claim could properly be brought as a § 1983 action where it challenged only\nthe particular lethal injection protocol being used by the state, not the validity of\nlethal injection sentences generally.  Hill v. McDonough, 546 U.S. ---, 126 S. Ct.\n1189, 1190, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1144 (2006) (mem.); 547 U.S. ---, 126 S. Ct. 2096,\n2102, 165 L. Ed. 2d 44 (2006).  On remand, we further remanded the case to the\ndistrict court for consideration on the merits.  Hill v. McDonough, --- F.3d ---,\n2006 WL 2472727, at *1  (11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006).\nThereafter, in the course of one day – September 1, 2006 – Hill filed an\namended complaint and request for a preliminary injunction, the State filed a\nresponse and motion to dismiss, and the district court issued an order denying the\ninjunction and dismissing the complaint.  On September 5, 2006, Hill moved for\nreconsideration, which motion was denied by the district court on September 11. \n3\n\nNow, Hill asks this court to stay his impending execution to allow for an expedited\nappeal.1\nAt the outset, we note that we do not here review the district court’s order\ndenying Hill’s request for injunctive relief and dismissing his complaint.  By his\ncurrent motion, Hill asks only that we delay the execution and expedite his appeal. \nWere we to grant the relief that Hill seeks, we would only reach a review of the\ndistrict court’s decision after receiving the parties’ arguments via an accelerated\nbriefing schedule.  With Hill’s execution scheduled to be carried out within a\nmatter of days from our receipt of the instant motion, we decline to engage in that\nprotracted, and ultimately futile, sequence of events.\nInstead, we dispose of Hill’s motion by denying his request for an\ninjunction based upon our independent analysis of the equities.  In its decision\nremanding Hill’s action to this court, the Supreme Court noted that it did not rule\non whether a condemned § 1983 plaintiff challenging the method of execution\nmight be eligible for a stay of execution to allow him to pursue his suit, but that\n“federal courts can and should protect States from dilatory or speculative suits” in\n1 Although Hill generally characterizes his motion as one for a “stay of execution,” it is\napparent that he petitions this court for a preliminary injunction, not a stay of the district court’s\norder.  The action of the district court leaves nothing for this court to stay, as the dismissal of the\ncomplaint and denial of reconsideration leave no further action to be taken by the district court. \nInstead, we treat Hill’s motion as a request for an order temporarily enjoining the State from\ncarrying out Hill’s execution until his appeal in this case can be decided.\n4\n\nrecognition of the “important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence.” \nHill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. at ---, 126 S. Ct. at 2104.  The Court further noted\nthat “a stay of execution is an equitable remedy.  It is not available as a matter of\nright, and equity must be sensitive to the State’s strong interest in enforcing its\ncriminal judgments.”  Id.  Thus, we consider Hill’s motion for injunctive relief\nanew, but with the clear indication from the Supreme Court in this case that we\nmay deny Hill’s request if the equities demand that result.\nAs with any application for injunctive relief, our analysis turns in part on\nthe type of injunction being sought.  Hill’s request for a preliminary injunction is\nnot predicated on any independent cause of action; instead, he requests the\ninjunction solely for the purpose of allowing time to pursue his appeal.  As such,\nthe injunction sought is not a “traditional” injunction, but instead one grounded in\nthe authority of the federal courts under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a),\nwhich states, “The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress\nmay issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions\nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” See Klay v. United\nHealthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092, 1099–1100 (11th Cir. 2004) (explaining that\n“[t]he Act does not create any substantive federal jurisdiction” and that the Act “is\na codification of the federal courts’ traditional, inherent power to protect the\n5\n\njurisdiction they already have, derived from some other source”).  An injunction\nunder the All Writs Act “must simply point to some ongoing proceeding, or some\npast order or judgment, the integrity of which is being threatened by someone\nelse’s action or behavior.”  Id. (noting “a court’s traditional power to protect its\njurisdiction”).  Such is clearly the case here.  Hill has noticed his appeal of the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of his § 1983 complaint, and we clearly have jurisdiction\nover that appeal.  Were we to grant a preliminary injunction in order to allow time\nto hear Hill’s appeal, we would be doing so to protect our appellate jurisdiction\nfrom the impending act of the State of Florida to execute Hill.2\nWe find, however, that the equities do not support Hill’s request.  Simply\nput, Hill was the architect of the very trap from which he now seeks relief.  At the\noutset, Hill filed his § 1983 complaint four days before his previously scheduled\nexecution date of January 24, 2006, and just after the Florida Supreme Court\nrejected his application for post-conviction relief on, among other grounds, his\nchallenge to the Florida lethal injection protocol.  See Hill v. State, 921 So. 2d\n579, 582–83 (Fla. 2006).  Hill’s assertion of essentially the same lethal injection\n2 Because we already have subject matter jurisdiction over Hill’s appeal of the dismissal\nof his § 1983 action, this case is entirely different from In re: Clarence Edward Hill, 437 F.3d\n1080, 1083 (11th Cir. 2006), where our jurisdiction ceased once we denied Hill’s application\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A) to file a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n6\n\nchallenge in the Florida courts reveals that he was aware of the grounds for the\nclaim much earlier than the date on which he actually filed his § 1983 action in\nfederal district court.  But we need not rely on that inference alone to determine\nthat Hill unreasonably delayed in filing his federal complaint.  The Florida\nSupreme Court considered a challenge to the Florida lethal injection protocols on\nsimilar grounds as early as 2000.  Sims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657, 666–68 (Fla.\n2000).3  Although it is unclear from the procedural history whether Hill addressed\nthe Sims precedent in his post-conviction proceedings after 2000, the fact remains\nthat, during the pendency of his various collateral challenges, Florida had\nconsidered the same type of claim upon which Hill now seeks relief.  In light of\nthis context, Hill cannot claim that it was impossible for him to initiate his federal\nsuit any earlier.\nFurther, with regard to more recent procedural history, Hill has again\ndemonstrated his intent to delay proceedings in order to necessitate a stay.  After\nthe district court denied his request for injunctive relief and dismissed his\ncomplaint, Hill moved for reconsideration and, again, for a stay of execution.  The\ndistrict court denied his motions on September 11, 2006, noting that “Hill’s\n3 The Florida Supreme Court relied on Sims in rejecting Hill’s lethal injection challenge\nduring post-conviction proceedings.   Hill v. State, 921 So. 2d at 582–83.\n7\n\nemotionally-laden arguments raise no new evidence. . . . [I]t appears that Hill is\nengaging in dilatory tactics to delay a death sentence.”  Order Denying Motion for\nReconsideration and Motion for Stay at 2–3, Hill v. McDonough, No. 4:06-CV-\n032-SPM (N.D. Fla. Sept. 11, 2006).   By moving for reconsideration, Hill only\nfurther delayed this court’s receipt of his case on appeal, bringing us within days\nof his scheduled execution before he filed the instant motion for a stay and\nexpedited appeal.\nIn light of Hill’s actions in this case, which can only be described as\ndilatory, we join our sister circuits in declining to allow further litigation of a §\n1983 case filed essentially on the eve of execution.  See White v. Johnson, 429\nF.3d 572, 573–74 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that even if the condemned inmate’s §\n1983 action was cognizable, “‘he is not entitled to the equitable relief he seeks’\ndue to his dilatory filing” (citations omitted)); Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414,\n417–18 (5th Cir. 2004) (condemned inmate who filed § 1983 action ten weeks\nbefore his scheduled execution “leaves little doubt that the real purpose behind his\nclaim is to seek a delay of his execution, not merely to effect an alteration of the\nmanner in which it is carried out”); see generally Hicks v. Taft, 431 F.3d 916 (6th\nCir. 2005); Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir. 2004).  This holding is\nconsistent with the Supreme Court’s instruction in its remand of Hill’s case that\n8\n\n“[a] court considering a stay must also apply ‘a strong equitable presumption\nagainst the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such time as\nto allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.’” Hill v.\nMcDonough, 547 U.S. at ---, 126 S. Ct. at 2104 (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, Hill’s motion for a stay of execution and expedited appeal is\nDENIED.\n9",

The Court has considered these\npleadings as well as the responses and the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants\n(docs. 6 and 34).   Hill is a death-sentenced inmate currently scheduled for\nexecution on September 20, 2006.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court\nfinds the motion to dismiss must be granted.\n1  Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (Jun. 12, 2006).\n2  Hill v. McDonough, No. 06-10621 (11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2006).\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 2 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 2 of  10\nBACKGROUND:\nFour days before his execution was scheduled to occur, Hill brought this\naction under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that Defendants, acting in their official\ncapacities under Florida law, will cause unnecessary pain in the execution of his\nsentence of death.  Hill claims that his execution will violate the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, which prohibit cruel\nand unusual punishment.  He requests an injunction barring Defendants from\nexecuting him in the manner they intend.  He claims that the particular protocol\nused by the Florida Department of Corrections (“DOC”) in carrying out their\nexecutions by lethal injection (three injections, including an anesthetic, a paralytic\nagent, and potassium chloride to stop the heart) “creates a foreseeable risk of\nthe gratuitous and unnecessary infliction of pain on a person being executed.” \n(Doc. 2 at 5).\nThis Court, on January 21, 2006, dismissed the motion for lack of\njurisdiction, citing the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F.3d\n1281 (11th Cir. 2004), which construed appellant’s action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nas a successive habeas corpus petition.  Although the decision was affirmed by\nthe Eleventh Circuit, Hill v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1084 (2006), the United States\nSupreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that because Hill was not\nchallenging lethal injection as a general matter, but only the method of injection,\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 3 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 3 of  10\nhe could proceed under §1983.  Hill v. McDonough, 126 S. Ct. 2096 (Jun. 12,\n2006).\nHill does not contest the legality of capital punishment as a whole, nor\ndoes he even assert that lethal injection per se is unconstitutional.  The narrow\nissue presented by Hill’s complaint is whether the specific lethal injection protocol\nutilized by DOC, with its particular sequence, amount and combination of\nchemicals, violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and\nunusual punishment.\nFACTS:\nHill bases his original and amended complaints on the affidavit of Dr.\nDavid A. Lubarsky (doc. 2, Attachment B) who co-authored a study published in\nThe Lancet, “Inadequate Anaesthesia in Lethal Injection for Execution,” Vol. 365,\nThe Lancet 1412-14 (April 16, 2005) (doc. 2, Attachment C).3  The Lancet study\nexplained that a typical lethal injection protocol consists of administering a\n3The article states as follows:\nLethal injection usually consists of sequential administration of sodium thiopental for\nanaesthesia, pancuronium bromide to induce paralysis, and finally potassium chloride to\ncause death. (Cite omitted).  Without anaesthesia, the condemned person would\nexperience asphyxiation, a severe burning sensation, massive muscle cramping, and\nfinally cardiac arrest.  Thus, adequate anaesthesia is necessary both to mitigate the\nsuffering of the condemned and to preserve public opinion that lethal injection is a near-\npainless death.\n The Lancet at 1412.               \n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 4 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 4 of  10\nsuccession of three drugs to effect the inmate’s death.  The first one, sodium\npentothal, acts as an anesthetic, while the second, pancuronium bromide,\nparalyzes the body and prevents the inmate from moving or otherwise showing\npain or discomfort.  The final chemical, potassium chloride, is what stops the\nheart and actually causes death.  \nThe study found, in the jurisdictions examined, that at least some of the\ntime, insufficient doses of anesthesia were administered, enabling the inmate to\nexperience the feelings of being suffocated and going into cardiac arrest, yet be\nunable to move or alert anyone to the problem.4 \nWhile Florida’s procedure was not examined in the study, Hill argues that\nFlorida’s practice is “substantially similar” and thus poses the same risk to\ninmates.  He requests a preliminary injunction temporarily prohibiting his\nexecution as well as a permanent injunction forever barring DOC from using its\ncurrent lethal injection method.  \nIn his amended complaint, Hill also raises for the first time before this\nCourt his concerns with regard to the formulation and adoption of Florida’s lethal\n4  The above conclusion is based on research and data from post-mortem toxicological\ntests conducted on condemned inmates in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina,\nfrom which the researchers found that the concentrations of thiopental (sodium pentothal) were\nlower than that required for surgery in 88% of the executed inmates and that 43% of the executed\ninmates had concentrations of thiopental consistent with awareness because they had an\ninsufficient amount of sodium pentothal in their bloodstream to provide adequate anesthesia. \n(Doc. 2-1 at 7-8).   The article suggests that “some inmates might experience awareness and pain\nduring execution.”  The Lancet at 1412.\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 5 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 5 of  10\ninjection procedures.  He contends, for example, that there is an absence of\nstandardized procedures for the administration of the chemicals and unqualified\npersonnel involved in the procedure as well as insufficient guidelines upon which\nthese personnel can rely if they are required to exercise their discretion during\nthe process of the execution.  Additionally, he contends that Florida’s protocol\nhas no plan in place if the inmate requires medical assistance during the\nexecution.  (See Doc. 37 at 4).5  \nANALYSIS:\nBefore the Court is Hill's request for a preliminary temporary injunction,\ni.e., a stay of execution, prohibiting Defendants from executing him until this\nCourt has had the opportunity to fully consider his complaint without haste.  The\nCourt’s analysis of this issue is guided by the strong equitable presumption\nagainst granting a stay in this case.  See Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for\nN. Dist. of Cal., 503 U.S. 653, 654, 112 S. Ct. 1652, 1653, 118 L. Ed. 2d 293\n(1992)(per curiam) and Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 158\nL. Ed. 2d 924 (2004).   As stressed by the Court in Nelson:\nA stay is an equitable remedy, and “[e]quity must take into consideration\n5  These same concerns were addressed in Sims.  See Sims, 754 So. 2d at 666 n.18. \nThe Florida Supreme Court examined them collectively, stating, “Because these subissues\nconcern the adequacy and sufficiency of the DOC’s written protocol, we have treated these seven\nsubissues together.”  Id.  The court went on to find that DOC’s procedures for administering lethal\ninjection “do not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment.”  Id. at 668.\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 6 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 6 of  10\nthe State’s strong interest in proceeding with its judgment and . . .\nattempt[s] at manipulation.” [Gomez, 503 U.S. at 654, 112 S. Ct. at 1653]. \nThus, before granting a stay, a district court must consider not only the\nlikelihood of success on the merits and the relative harm to the parties, but\nalso the extent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing\nthe claim.  Given the State’s significant interest in enforcing its criminal\njudgments, there is a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a\nstay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow\nconsideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\nId. at 541 U.S. at 649-50, 124 S. Ct. at 2126 (internal citations omitted).  The\nCourt in Hill v. McDonough, 126 S. Ct. at 2104, reiterated this point:  “We state\nagain, as we did in Nelson, that a stay of execution is an equitable remedy.  It is\nnot available as a matter of right, and equity must be sensitive to the State’s\nstrong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue influence from\nthe federal courts.”  \nWhile the Lancet study itself may be relatively new, the factual basis of\nHill’s claim (that the doses of the anesthetic sodium pentothal may be insufficient,\nthus permitting those injected to experience the feelings of being suffocated and\nhaving a heart attack, but unable to express their pain by virtue of being\nparalyzed by pancuronium), has been raised and disposed of in other cases.  \nSee Brown v. Crawford, 408 F.3d 1027 (8th Cir. 2005); Bieghler v. State, 839\nN.E.2d 691 (Ind. 2005).  This Court also held in its previous order dated January\n21, 2006 that “[p]laintiff has made no showing that he could not have discovered\nthese underlying predicates through the exercise of due diligence.”  (Doc. 10 at\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 7 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 7 of  10\n4).\nMoreover, Florida’s lethal injection methods were subjected to a full\nevidentiary hearing in 2000 in Sims v. State, 754 So. 2d 657 (Fla. 2000), and Hill\ncould have challenged the procedure after the Sims decision was rendered.  The\nprocedural history of this case is set out more fully in Hill v. State, 921 So.2d 579\n(Fla. 2006).   Hill was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in\nMay of 1983; his conviction became final some five years later.  See Hill v.\nFlorida, 485 U.S. 993 (1988).  \nOn November 29, 2005, Governor Bush signed a death warrant\nscheduling Hill’s sentence of death to be carried out on January 24, 2006.  On\nDecember 15, 2005, Hill filed a successive motion for postconviction relief in\nstate court raising for the first time the same argument with regard to lethal\ninjection that he raises here.  The trial court denied  this motion and the Florida\nSupreme Court affirmed this denial.  Hill then filed the instant complaint pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on January 20, 2006, just four days prior to the date of his\nexecution. \nHill has offered no reason for his delay in bringing a § 1983 action until\njust days before his scheduled execution.   Therefore, under the authority of\nGomez, Nelson and Hill, this Court finds that Hill has delayed unnecessarily in\nbringing his § 1983 challenge of Florida’s lethal injection procedure, and his\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 8 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 8 of  10\ncomplaint must be dismissed.  See also In re Hicks, 375 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th\nCir. 2004); Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 2004)(“By waiting as\nlong as he did, Harris leaves little doubt that the real purpose behind his claim is\nto seek a delay of his execution, not merely to effect an alteration of the manner\nin which it is carried out.”); White v. Johnson, 429 F.3d 572, 574 (5th Cir.\n2005)(“White has been on death row for more than six years, and only now, with\nhis execution imminent, has decided to challenge a procedure for lethal injection\nthat the State has been using for his entire stay on death row . . . . White has no\nexcuse for delaying his claim until the eleventh hour, and he cannot argue that\n‘he was unaware of the State’s intention to execute him by injecting the three\nchemicals he now challenges.’” (citing Harris, supra, 376 F.3d at 417)); White v.\nLivingston, 126 S. Ct. 601 (2005)(denial of stay of execution); Patton v. Jones,\n2006 WL 2468312 (10th Cir. Aug. 25, 2006); Reese v. Livingston, 453 F. 3d 289,\n291 (5th Cir. June 20, 2006)(court denied request for stay as untimely)(“Reese’s\nlate claim is no different than the late claim in White [v. Johnson], and we are not\npersuaded that Hill has undermined the decisions of this Court insisting upon a\ntimely filing or that until Hill the suit could not have been brought.”) 6 \nThis Court finds persuasive the following comments made by the Reese\n6\n  The Supreme Court also recognized in Nelson that “the mere fact that an inmate states a\ncognizable § 1983 claim does not warrant the entry of a stay as a matter of right.”  Nelson, 541 U.S. at 649,\n124 S. Ct. at 2125-26.\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 9 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 9 of  10\ncourt in denying the request for equitable relief as untimely:\nTimely filing would have afforded the opportunity for developing\nfacts and considered resolution of the merits of the repeated\ncharges being leveled against this method of execution.  Testimony\nin open court can cast away shadows and allow a principled\ndecision of the merit of the assertions of all concerned–rather than\nforcing courts to choose between speculative assertions and “just\ntrust me” responses.  As we read Hill, a plaintiff cannot wait until a\nstay must be granted to enable him to develop facts and take the\ncase to trial–not when there is no satisfactory explanation for the\ndelay.  \nReese, 453 F.3d at 291.\nIn addition to the Lancet study, Hill contends in his amended complaint\nthat “new and critical” information has surfaced since his original complaint.  This\ninformation is recent case law from other federal jurisdictions in which evidentiary\nhearings were held and discovery conducted with regard to the various states’\nlethal injection protocols and procedures.  Hill cites Taylor v. Crawford, 2006 WL\n1779035 (W.D. Mo. Jun. 26, 2006), Morales v. Hickman, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.\nFeb. 19, 2006), and Cooey v. Taft, 430 F.Supp.2d 702 (Apr. 28, 2006).  These\ncases are not binding on this Court, and they can be distinguished significantly\nfrom Hill’s case.  In each of these cases, the inmate brought his § 1983 action\neither prior to having an execution date set or in a timely enough manner that the\ncourt was able to adequately develop a factual record.7  The courts in Cooey and\n7The Court notes that in Cooey v. Taft, 430 F. Supp. 2d 702 (Apr. 28, 2006), one of the\nplaintiffs was allowed to intervene in the § 1983 action prior to his execution date being set; thus\nthe district court granted an injunction staying his execution once scheduled.  The court\nspecifically found that the plaintiff had not unnecessarily delayed in bringing an action under §\n\nCase 4:06-cv-00032-SPM     Document 39     Filed 09/01/2006     Page 10 of 10(cid:10)\nPage 10 of  10\nMorales specifically found that the inmates were diligent in filing their § 1983\nactions;8 thus, those courts were not bound by the precedent which this Court\nmust follow.   Hill’s unnecessary delay in bringing this action forecloses the relief\nwhich he seeks.\nAccordingly, it is \nORDERED and ADJUDGED as follows:\n1. The amended motion to dismiss (doc. 34) is hereby granted.\n2. The “Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive\nRelief” (doc. 37) is hereby dismissed.\n3. No stay of execution shall issue in this case.                 \nDONE and ORDERED this first day of September, 2006.\n   s/ Stephan P. Mickle              \nStephan P. Mickle\nUnited States District Judge\n1983. The court stated, “. . . Plaintiff [Jeffrey] Hill was not within days of his execution.  He did not\nsit on his laurels.  He did not wait until the State had set or even requested an execution date.” \nSee id. at 706.\n8See id.  Also, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Morales v. Hickman, 438 F.3d 926,\n930 (Feb. 19, 2006), stated “Morales’ diligence allowed the court to more thoroughly consider the\nrelevant legal and factual issues that ultimately bore on its conclusion.”  ",

HILL, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nJames McDONOUGH, Charlie Crist, Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 06-10621.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.\nAugust 29, 2006.\nD. Todd Doss, D. Todd Doss, P.A., Lake City, FL, for Hill.\nBefore EDMONDSON, Chief Judge, and TJOFLAT and PRYOR, Circuit Judges.\nON REMAND FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nClarence E. Hill is a Florida death row inmate. On January 20, 2006, Hill brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nto enjoin the State of Florida from carrying out his execution by lethal injection on January 24, 2006. He alleged\nthat the State's execution procedure constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments because the first drug to be injected, sodium pentothal, would not suffice as an anesthetic to render\npainless the administration of the second and third drugs that would cause his death. That is, he could remain\nconscious and suffer severe pain as the second drug paralyzed his lungs and the third drug caused cramping\nand a fatal heart attack.\nThe district court, relying on our decision in Robinson v. Crosby, 358 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir.2004), concluded that\nHill's § 1983 claim was the functional equivalent of a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which this\ncourt had not authorized him to file, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A), and therefore dismissed the claim for lack of\njurisdiction. We affirmed. Hill v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1084, 1085 (11th Cir. 2006).\nHill petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The Court granted the writ and stayed his execution\npending its resolution of the case. Hill v. Crosby, 546 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 1190, 163 L.Ed.2d 1144 (2006)\n(mem). Following oral argument, the Court held that Hill's § 1983 claim could proceed, vacated our judgment,\nand remanded the case for further proceedings. Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 2102-04, 165\nL.Ed.2d 44 (2006). Since, as the Supreme Court observed, \"[t]he equities and the merits of Hill's underlying\naction\" have not been determined, id. at 2104, and because the district court is the appropriate forum for such\n1314 determination, we vacate that *1314 court's decision and remand the case for further proceedings.\nSO ORDERED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
