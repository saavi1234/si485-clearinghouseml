Definitions \nA.  \"Defendants\" are the Secretary of US. Department of Heath and Human Services, in \nhis official capacity; Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, in his official \ncapacity; and the Associate Commissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and \nFamilies, in his official capacity. \nB.  \"Department\" means the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services. \nC.  \"Silver Ring Thing\" (\"SRT\") is that organization doing business as Silver Ring Thing \ncUlTent1y located at 530 Moon Clinton Road, Moon Twp., Pennsylvania, 15108 or \nany successors to that entity known to the Defendants. \nD.  \"Plaintiff' is the American Civil Liberties Union ofMassachuselts. \nII.  Background \nA.  On May 16, 2005, Plaintiff filed a complaint in US. District Court, District of \nMassachusetts, alleging that Defendants' funding of Silver Ring Thing (\"SRT\") \nviolated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n\nB.  Under current regulatory requirements of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, \"Organizations that receive direct financial assistance from the Department \nof Health and Human Services under any Department program may not engage in \ninherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or \nproselytization, as part of the programs or services funded with direct financial \nassistance from the Department.\" 45 C.F.R. 87.1 (c).  69 Fed. Reg. 42586, 42593 \n(2004).  \"If an organization conducts [inherently religious] activities, the activities \nmust be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded \nwith direct financial assistance from the Department ....\"   Id. \nC.  On August 22, 2005, the Department --through Defendant Harry Wilson, Associate \nCommissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and Families (\"FYSB\")---sent \nSRT a letter explaining that the Department had reviewed the terms and conditions of \nthe grant and their relation to all applicable federal laws and regulations including, \nbut not limited to, 45 C.F.R. Part 87 (2005).  The letter stated in part: \"Our review \nindicates that SRT may not have included adequate safeguards to clearly separate in \ntime or location inherently religious activities from the federally-funded activities.  In \nparticular, it appears that the Federal project that is funded under the SRT grant \nincludes both secular and religious components that are not adequately separated. \nBased on the information received to date, we do not believe that SRT  ' s actual use of \nfederal funds for its program adequately complies with Federal grant requirements. \nAccordingly, FYSB is suspending the drawdown of Federal funds until such time as \nwe are confident that the SRT program is in compliance with all relevant federal \nrules, regulations and policies.\"  A copy of this document is attached to this \nagreement as Exhibit 1. \nD.  On September 20, 2005, FYSB sent SRT a letter regarding a possible Corrective \nAction Plan (\"CAP\") for SRT.  That letter stated in part:  \"As you know, the Federal \ngoverrunent is prohibited from funding 'inherently religious activities.'  Enclosed \nwith this letter is a listing of safeguards that we believe will provide a general \nframework for addressing the concerns we have raised with your program. ... We \nrecommend that SRT consider these safeguards when drafting a CAP, and provide \ndetailed plans for how the SRT specifically plans to make changes to its program.\" A \ncopy of that September 20, 2005 letter, with the attached list of \"Safeguards \nRequired,\" is attached to this agreement at Exhibit 2. \nE.  SRT and the Administration for Children and Families CACF\") ternlinated the SRI \ngrant effective January 31, 2006. \nIII.  Terms of Agreement \nA.  Defendants agree that, consistent with regulatory requirements in place at the time of \nthis agreement, they will not fund the abstinence education program of SRT as that \nprogram was structured and implemented by SRT throughout the term ofthe FY05 \ngrant. \n2 \n\n1.  In the event that SRT applies for an abstinence education grant award from \nDefendants or Defendants fund SRT's abstinence education program during fiscal \nyears 2006 through 2008, and to the extent consistent with then-existing legal \nrequirements administered by the Defendants as to all grantees, Defendants shall \nundertake the following actions with respect to SRT: \na.  Defendants shall require SRT to set forth in its grant application a \ndescription of the program and activities for which it is seeking federal \ngrant funds.  Defendants shall require SRT to state how it plans to spend \ngovernment funds and to track its spending of government funds. \nb.  Defendants shall ensure that SRT's program, activities, and accounting \nprocedures are consistent with 45 C.F.R. Part 87 (2005), which \nspecifically prohibits the use offederal funds to support inherently \nreligious activities and imposes the requirement that any such activities \nbe conducted separately in time or location from HHS-funded programs \nor servIces. \n2.  In the event that SRT applies for an abstinence education grant award from ACF \nor ACF funds SRI's abstinence education program during fiscal years 2006 \nthrough 2008, and to the extent consistent with then-existing legal requirements \nadministered by the ACF as to all grantees, ACF shall undertake the following \nactions with respect to SRI. \na.  ACF shall ensure that SRT's program, activities, and accounting \nprocedures are consistent with the \"Safeguards Required\" set forth in the \nthree-page attachment to the September 20, 2005 letter from the FYSB \nto SRT.  A copy of that September 20,2005 letter, with the attached list \nof \"Safeguards Required,\" is attached to this agreement at Exhibit 2. \nb.  ACF shall require SRT to sign a certification and grant assurance that it \nwill comply with 45 C.F.R. Part 87 (2005), which specifically prohibits \nthe use of federal funds to support inherently religious activities and \nimposes the requirement that any such activities be conducted separately \nin time or location from HHS-funded programs or services. \nc.  ACF shall conduct quarterly monitoring phone calls ofSRT that will \ninclude discussing key issues, problems, and corrective actions \nproposed. As necessary and appropriate, should Defendants obtain \ninformation that they believe requires further on-site inspection, ACF \nwill undertake a site visit to SRT to inqnire as to whether SRT is \ncomplying with the conditions and terms set forth in SRI's grant \napplication, the certification described above in Part IIL2.b. and 45 \nC.F.R. Part 87.  After reviewing the results of monitoring phone calls \nand/or site visits, ACF will specifically raise with SRT any issues \nconcerning SRI's compliance with the conditions and terms described \nabove; create a record of those issues; and take any and all actions that \n3 \n\nDefendants determine are necessary to ensure SRT's compliance, \nincluding by setting a deadline for corrective action and other actions set \nforth in 45 C.F.R. Part 74 (2005).  After reviewing the results of each \nsuch monitoring call, and/or reports of site visits, ACF will summarize \nits findings as to SRT's compliance in an agency record that is subject to \nthe Freedom ofInfonnation Act. \nd.  During the duration of this agreement, Defendants further agree to \nprovide the Plaintiff (ACLU of Massachusetts) through its counsel \n(ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU Foundation) with \nnotice that SRT has received a Congressional earmark, or will otherwise \nbe awarded a grant by ACF for abstinence education no later than 30 \ndays after ACF leams of the Congressional eannark or 30 days after \nSRT has been notified of a grant award.  Defendants further agree to \nprovide Plaintiff through its counsel with notice that SRT has applied for \na grant from ACF no later than 30 days after ACF receives the grant \napplication. \nB.  This agreement shall remain in effect until September 30, 2008, which is the last day \nofFY08. \nC.  This agreement does not constitute an admission of the correctness of any position \ntaken by any party in this litigation, or an admission by the Defendants that any of \ntheir actions at issue in Plaintiffs' Complaint were contrary to law, statute, regulation, \nor policy. \nD.  This agreement in no way precludes Plaintiff from filing suit against Defendants or \ntheir successors for failure to comply with the Constitution, federal law, or the tenns \nof this agreement. \nE.  The parties shall bear their own attomey fees and costs in this action. \nF.  By separate stipulation, the Plaintiff and the Defendants shall stipulate to the \ndismissal of the above-captioned civil action without prejudice pursuant to Rule \n41 (a)(l)(ii), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  IfIntervenor the Silver Ring Thing \ndeclines to join the stipulated dismissal, Plaintiff and Defendants shall jointly file a \nmotion to dismiss the action without prejndice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2). \n4 \n\nSIGNED AND STIPULATED TO ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES \nFOR THE DEFENDANTS \nPETER D.

We have also reviewed the tenns and conditions of the grant and their relation to \nall applicable federal laws and regulations including, but not limited to 45 CFR 87.1(0) \n(Federal Register Volume 69, No. 136, July 16,2004). RegUlations governing the \nCommUnity-Based Abstinence Education funding state the following: \nOrganizations that receive direct (mancial assistance from the Department \nmay not engage in inherently religious activities, such as Worship, \nreligious instruction, orprosclytlzation, as part of the programs or services \nfunded with direct :financial assistance from the Department,  If an \norganization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered \nseparately, in time or location, from the programs or services finlded with \ndirect financial assistance from the Department, and participation must be \nvoluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services funded with such \nassistance. \n45 CPR 87.1(c), \nOur review indicates that the SRT may not have included adequate safeguards to clearly \nseparate in time or location inherently religious activities from the federally-funded \nactivities.  Tn particular, it appears that the Federal project that is funded under the SRT \ngrant includes both secular and religious components that are not adequately separated. \nBased on the information received to date, we do not believe that SRT's actual use of \nfederal funds for its program adequately complies with Federal grant requirements. \nAccordingly, FYSB is suspending the drawdown of Federal funds until such Hme as we \nare confident that the SRT program is in compliance with all relevant federal rules, \nregulations and policies. \nvIG-,  SOO/ZOO'd  vtV-l  .IDOJ,  IDeo,: II  ,o-zz-!ny \n\nPage 2 -Mr. Denny Pattyn \nIn addition, we are requiring that the SRT submit to FYSB a COl1.'ective Action Plan \n(CAP) that remedies the issues identified above.

Somo of the ways in which this \nmay be accomplished include, but are not limited to, the following examples: \n•  Creating separate and distinct names lor the programs; \n•  Creating separat.e and distinct looks for the promotionalmatcrials used to promote \neach program; and  . \n•  Promoting only the federally ftmded abstinence education program in materials, \nwcbsitcs,. or comtll.crcials purchased with any por(ion of the federal funds. \n45 CFR 87.1 (c).  (\"Organizations that receive direcljinancial assistancefi'Oi'I\"I rhe \nDepartment under any Department program may not engage in inherently religious \nactivities, such as worship, religious illstrzlction, or proselytizatiol1, as part of the \nprograms 01' selllicesfi{nded with direct financial assisl!1nce from the Department. ''). \n69 Fed Reg. 42586, 42593 (2004). \n2.  Separate Pre,sentatiolls \nCompletely separate the presentation of any abstinence education prognlrn with \nreligious content from the presentation of the federally fllndedabstillencc education \nprogram by time or 10catio11 iJl such a way that it is clear that the tlOJO programs are \nseparate and distinct.· If separating the two programs by time but presenting them in \nthe same location, one programm\\lsi completely end before the other program begins. \nSome of the ways in which.separation ofprescntatiol1S may be accomplished include, \nbut are not limited to, the following exarnples.: \n•  The programs are hcldin comp1ctely different sites or all completely \n. d iffe rellt days, \n•  The programs arc held at tile same site at completely different times, \nScpamtion may be accomplished through such mcans as: \nHave suffkient time between the two programs to vacate the room, turn down \nthe lights, leave the stage, etc. in order to reasonably conclude the first \nprogram bdore beginning the second; \nCompletely dismiss the partici.pants of the first program; \nThe second program could follow in the same room or,where feasible, in a \ndifferent room to further ciistingnish the difference between the programs. \n•  The programs are held ill different locations of the same sHe at the same \ntime: \nSeparation may bo accomplished through such means as: \nCompletely separate registration locations; and \nCompletelyseparate areas where programs are held snch as by room, ballway, \nor Hoor, ctc.  . \n\n45 CFR 87.1.

'').  69 Fed. \nReg. 42586, 42593 (2004). \nI\\l0te:  federal guidelines that have been drafted for situations where a federal grantee \nalso provides religious programming use examples where an organization offered \nprograms that are completely different ft:om eilch.other such as a soup kitchen and a \nprayer meeting.  Because the SRT organization offers two programs that both \npromote abstinence until marriage and because the clients served arc children, it is \nvery impomll1t that the separation between the programs be accentuated. \n3.  Religions M.aterials \nEliminate all religions materials from the presentation of the federally funded \nabstinence edllcation program.  This inelu'des: \n•  Rings with religious messages; . \n•  Bibles; \n•  Abstinence vows with religious references; \n•  Registration materials that inelude religious inquiries Or refer\"l1ces; \n•  Follow np activities.that include or lead to religious outreach; and \n•  Religiollscolltent in parent materials. \n45 CPR 87.1.

Cost Allocation' \nDemonstrate thnt federal funds are only being used for the kdcrally 1imded \nabstinence education program.  Some of the ways in which separation of fnnds may \nbe accomplished ineli.lde,bui are not limited to, the foliowing examples: \n•  Implement the use of time sheets that keep track of all staff hoUl'S charged to the \nfederally funded grant, whether the staITwork in other programs or not. \n•  Require any staff working in both federally funded programs and other programs \nto clearly indic.ate how many hours. arc spent on each program. \n•  If 3ny staff work on hoth a federally flmdc.'<1 program and a nOll-federally Iunded \nprogram at the same site oi1 the same day, reqUire the staff to clearly indicate not \nonly how many hours are spent on the federal program but also wlrich S1Jccific \nhours are spent on the federal progmm.  The hour.s should reflect that time spent \non any abstinence education program with religiolls content have been complelely \nseparated from bours spent on the federally funded abstinence education program. \n•  Show cost allocations for all .items and activities that involve both programs such \nas staff time, equipment, or other expenses such astrave! \\0 event sites. \nThis may be accomplished through such means as: \nExample:  iftransportation is used to go to a site where a federally funded \nabstinence education program is conducted and a religious or non-religious \nprogram funded tluough othel\" means is also conducted by the grantee at the \nsame site,. one half of the travel costs (gas, lodging, etc.) should be charged \n\nto the federal program, .If !lIree separate and distinct programs are \nconducted at a site by a federaLly funded grantee and one of them is the \nfederally fll11ded program, only one third of the travel costs should be \ncharged to the fedoral program, etc, \nExample:  if an electronic device is used 30% of the timo [or the federally \nfunded abstinence education program, this should be demonstrated through \nclear record keeping,  Only 30% of the cost of the electronic device should \nbe charged to the program. \nOMB CircuLar A-I 22, Attachment A. § AA,a, (2);  45 C.F.R. 87.1, . \n5.

Invitation toRcligious pj'ogram \nAt the end oflhe federally funded abstinence education program, grantee may \nprovide a bricfand non-coercivc invitation to attend the religious abstinence \neducation rirogram,  . \nThe invimtion should make it very clear that this is a separate program from the \nfederally fUl1dedahstinence education program, that parlicipltllts arc not required to \nattend, and that participation in federally funded programs are not contingent on \nparticipation in other programs sponsored by the grantee organization, \nReligious materials, such as theSilver Ring Thing Bible, a ring with religious \nelements, and registration that includes religions follow-up may only be provided in \nthe privately funded program rather than the federally funded program. \n45 CPR 87.1 (c),.

MAGISTRATE JUDGE = ~2 ~ ,.~_.,\nPlaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (\"Plaintiff\" or \"ACLU of\nMassachusetts\"), for its complaint in the above-captioned matter, alleges as follows:\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n1. Defendants have provided more than one million dollars of public funds to an\norganization called the \"Silver Ring Thing\" (or \"SRT\"). The Silver Ring Thing is a ministry that\nuses abstinence education as a means to bring \"unchurched\" students to Jesus Christ. Federal\ndollars support the Silver Ring Thing’s religious activities and religious content. Both because\nthe federal funding of the Silver Ring Thing constitutes a direct government grant to a\npervasively sectarian institution and because the federal dollars are demonstrably underwriting\nreligious activities and religious content, the funding violates the Establishment Clause of the\n\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution. Furthermore, the federal grant to the SRT\nimpermissibly communicates a message of governmental endorsement of and preference for\nreligion in general and the specific religious tenets of SRT in particular. Plaintiff- whose\nmembers include taxpayers whose tax dollars are used to finance the Silver Ring Thing program\n- seeks, among other relief, an injunction barring the Defendants from continuing to fund the\nSilver Ring Thing.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n2. This action arises under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution\nand presents a federal question within this Court’s jurisdiction under Article IIl of the\nConstitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n3. Plaintiff\" s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the\ninherent equitable powers of this Court.\nThe Court has the authority to award costs and attorneys’ fees under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2412.\n5. Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (e).\nPARTIES\n6. PlaintiffACLU of Massachusetts is a statewide affiliate of the national American\nCivil Liberties Union. The ACLU of Massachusetts is incorporated as a Massachusetts not-for-\nprofit corporation and is a membership organization with approximately 20,000 members in the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. The mission of the ACLU of Massachusetts is to defend and\nadvance the individual freedoms embodied in the federal and Massachusetts Constitutions. The\nACLU of Massachusetts conducts extensive advocacy in support of the rights safeguarded by the\n2\n\nEstablishment Clause of the United States Constitution. Its members include individuals who\npay income taxes to the United States and who oppose government funding that promotes\nreligion, including such government funding to the Silver Ring Thing.\n7. Defendant Harry Wilson is the Associate Commissioner for the Administration on\nChildren, Youth and Families and is the head of the Family and Youth Services Bureau\n(\"FYSB\"), the subdivision of the United States Department of Health and Human Services\n(\"HHS’) charged with administering the federal Abstinence Education Special Congressional\nInitiative Project Grants to the SRT. Defendant Wilson has failed to sufficiently monitor or\naudit the funding of SRT. Defendant Wilson and his successors are sued in their official\ncapacity.\n8. Defendant Wade Horn is Assistant Secretary for Children and Families for the\nAdministration for Children and Families in HHS. Defendant Horn has authority over the\nFamily and Youth Services Bureau and has failed to cause FYSB to monitor or audit the funding\nof SRT sufficiently. Defendant Horn and his successors are sued in their official capacity.\n9. Defendant Mike Leavitt is the Secretary of the United States Department of\nHealth and Hmnan Services and is responsible for the administration and oversight of the\nDepartment. Defendant Leavitt has authority over the Administration on Children, Youth and\nFamilies and FYSB and has failed to guarantee that the funding of SRT is sufficiently monitored\nor audited. Defendant Leavitt and his successors are sued in their official capacity.\nFACTS GIVING RISE TO THIS ACTION\nA. The Silver Ring Thing\n10.    The federal government has awarded more than one million dollars to the Silver\nRing Thing in the past three years.\n\n11. According to IRS filings, the Silver Ring Thing, IRS ID number 25-1376083, is\nalso known as the John Guest Evangelistic Team, which has the same address, the same\ntelephone number, and the same IRS ID number.\n12. According to 2001 IRS filings, the John Guest Evangelistic Team is an\n\"Evangelistic Ministry.\" In its \"Statement of Program Service Accomplislmnents,\" it describes\nits three main programs as \"Evangelistic crusade planning, coordination, and implementation,\nincluding development and distribution of religious material,\" \"International evangelistic\nprograms including Christian center in Cuba, Ukraine, Ghana and Holland,\" and \"Radio\nbroadcast of religious teaching on twelve radio stations.\" Internal Revenue Service Form 990,\n2001 (filed Aug. 12, 2002).\n13. In the I3BC documentary, \"American Virgins,\" Silver Ring Thing Executive\nDirector Dennis Pattyn states, \"I believe that the end of the world is approaching very quickly\nand I believe that Christ will come back .I.. .believe that we are approaching the return of\nChrist, which is a huge event.\" When asked if abstinence is the appropriate place for his energies\nif the end of the world is so close, Mr. Pattyn explains that abstinence education is merely a\nmeans to an end for the Silver Ring Thing, and the end is to bring faith into the lives of students.\n14.    In the It ~\" Time Silver Ring Thing newsletters, the Silver Ring Thing/John Guest\nEvangelistic Team describes \"Our Ministry\" as follows: \"The ministry of John Guest and his\nteam is to call our world to Christ. The Silver Ring Thing is now the primary outreach of the\nJohn Guest Team. The mission is to saturate the United States with a generation of young people\nwho have taken a vow of sexual abstinence until marriage and put on the silver ring. l’his\nmission can only be achieved by offering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the best\n\nway to live a sexually pure life.\" See, e.g., Silver Ring Thing It ~’ Time Newsletters, Fall 2004,\nSpring 2004, May 2004, April 2004.\n15.    Articles in the II ’s’ Time newsletters highlight the success of the Silver Ring Thing\nin achieving its stated mission. For example, the April 2004 SRT newsletter commented, \"Who\nwould have ever thought we would see the day when promoting sexual abstinence among\nstudents would become an opportunity to communicate the Good News of the Gospel. Through\nour Silver Ring Thing program, students who are longing for sexual purity have the chance to\nbegin again. The Good News that comes with Jesus Christ is that He is the power and the hope\nof starting over.\" April 2004 Newsletter\nhttp://www.silverringthing.com/images/srtnewsCW324final.pdf).\n16.    According to SRT’s applications for federal funds, a key component of the Silver\nRing Thing program is its three-hour high-tech multi-media presentations (\"Three-Hour\nPresentation\") that culminate in students taking an abstinence pledge and donning the SRT ring:\n\"The high-tech presentation is the ’thing’ in the Silver Ring ThTinhge  .p..r.ogram features\nhilarious skits, concert sound systems, and high-energy music and is presented by a team of\ntalented and trained peer level performers. A typical SRT event lasts three hours...\" \"The\nclimax of the event, is when the participants join together in reciting the abstinence pledge which\nstates that they will present their silver ring to their spouse on their wedding day, symbolizing\nthat they have abstained from sexual behavior.\"\n17. According to Silver Ring’s Thing’s website, SRT has held at least three of these\nevents in the Boston area since April 2003, and another Boston event is tentatively scheduled for\nOctobm- 15, 2005.\n5\n\n18.    On information and belief, the Three-Hour Presentation, discussed in more detail\nbelow, is permeated with religion.\n19.    In keeping with SRT’s focus on bringing students to Jesus, the registration card\nfor the Three-Hour Presentation requires the following information: name, address, email\naddress, age, school, grade, \"Do you currently attend church?\" \"If so, where?\" Students are\nrequired to fill out a registration card in order to attend a SRT Three-Hour Presentation.\n20. The SRT announces in its SRT newsletter how many students after each Three-\nHour Presentation have \"made a commitment to Jesus.\"\n21.    This same information about how many students have \"made a commitment to\nJesus\" after each Three-Hour Presentation is posted on its website as well. The website also\nincludes a photograph of the students at a particular Three-Hour Presentation who have \"made a\ncommitment to Christ.\"\n22.    In response to an inquiry about the SRT school assembly program, an SRT\nrepresentative stated in an e-mail dated August 30, 2004: \"The vision of our program is to reach\nas many un-churched students as possible, and we see [public school] assemblies as an\nopportunity to reach a larger audience.\" In an e-mail dated August 26, 2004, the SRT\nrepresentative explained that \"[b]asically, the assembly is designed to compel students to attend\nthe [Three-Hour Presentation] following shortly afterwards.\"\n23.    According to SRT’s federal grant applications, another key component of the\nSilver Ring Thing is its twelve-step follow-up plan (\"Follow-Up Plan\"): \"SRT recognizes that\nmaking a pledge and putting on a ring is only the beginning. Very few people can remain true to\ntheir pledge unless they have strong individual and group support. For this reason, SRT has\ncreated a 12-Step follow-up plan.\"\n6\n\n24. On inforrnation and belief, as described below, religion permeates the Follow-Up\nPlan.\n25.    On information and belief, it is not possible to participate fully in the complete\nSRT program, which includes the Three-Hour Presentation and Follow-Up Plan, without\nencountering religious content and proselytization.\n26. On intbrmation and belief, the Silver Ring Thing is so permeated by religion that\nany secular activities it has cannot be separated from its sectarian ones.\nB. Religious Content of SRT’s Three-Hour Presentation\n27.    On information and beliel; the Silver Ring Thing’s Three-Hour Presentation,\nwhich federal dollars help support, is a highly religious program that promotes Christianity.\n28.    On intbrmation and belief, the Three-Hour Presentation is offered in two parts.\nThere is a short intermission between the first and second part.\n29.    On information and belief, during the intermission, SRT Executive Director\nDennis Pattyn asks students to decide whether they want to hear more about abstinence with or\nwithout religion.\n30.    On information and belief, students are strongly encouraged to remain for the\nreligious programming. For example, Mr. Pattyn has told the audience that he highly\nencourages them to stay in the room.\n31.    On information and belief, students attending the Three-Hour Presentation feel\npressured to attend the religious programming.\n32.    On information and belief, federal funds support both the religious programming\nand the secular programming in the second part of the Three-Hour Presentation.\n\n33.    On information and belief, those who wish to attend the secular programming\nmust go to a different room than the one used for the first part of the Three-Hour Presentation.\nThose attending the religious progran~ming do not need to switch rooms.\n34.    On information and beliel; in typical sessions, no more than a handful of students\nleave the room for the secular programming.\n35.    On information and belief, those who remain for the religious programming are\nexposed to a ninety-minute session suffused with religious proselytization.\n36. On information and belief, in the religious programming, SRT members testify on\nstage about how their lives improved after they accepted Jesus Christ.\n37.    On information and belief, in the religious programming, SRT members quote and\nexplicate Bible passages on stage.\n38.    On information and belief, in the religious programming, Mr. Pattyn discusses on\nstage his own born-again experiences that occurred when he was a teenager.\n39.    On information and belief, in the religious programming, Mr. Pattyn urges\naudience members to do as he did and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to come into their lives.\n40.    On information and belief, in the religious programming, Mr. Pattyn recites a\nprayer asking Christ to forgive any past sins, and tells audience members that their sins could be\nforgiven on the spot.\n41.    On information and belief, at the end of the event, Mr. Pattyn instructs audience\nmembers to go get their rings.\n42.    On information and belief, the rings are available at all SRT performances and\ncost $15.00.\n\n43.    The rings are inscribed with \"1 Thess. 4:3-4.\" This is a reference to the Bible\nverse 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, which reads: \"God wants you to be holy, so you should keep clear\nof all sexual sin. Then each of you will control your body and live in holiness and honor.\"\n44.    On information and belief, SRT does not offer SRT rings without inscription of\nthis biblical verse.\n45.    On information and belief, students are given a Silver Ring Thing Sexual\nAbstinence Study Bible when they purchase a ring.\n46. On information and belief, once people have their SRT ring and SRT Bible, Mr.\nPattyn directs the audience to the first page of the Bible. This page contains the Silver Ring\nThing Covenant. The audience is told to fill in their names, sign and date it, and within three days\nidentify an accountability partner who would countersign the Covenant.\n47.    The Silver Ring Thing Covenant reads: \"In signing this covenant before God\nAlmighty, I , agree to wear a silver ring as a sign of my pledge to abstain from\nsexual behavior that is inconsistent with Biblical standards. On my wedding day, I will present\nmy silver ring to my spouse, representing my faithful commitment to the marriage covenant.\"\nThere are places for both the student and his or her accountability partner to sign.\n48.    On information and belief, SRT does not offer an SRT abstinence pledge without\nreligious content.\n49.    On information and belief, these examples of religious content in the SRT three-\nhour event are not exhaustive.\n\nC. Religious Content of SRT’s Twelve-Step Follow-Up Program\n50. On information and belief, the Silver Ring Thing’s twelve-step follow-up\nprogram, which federal dollars help support, is a highly religious program that promotes\nChristianity.\n51. The Silver Ring Thing describes on its website\n(http://www.silverringthing.com/follow.html) its twelve-step follow-up program as follows:\nI. The Ring - the symbol and namesake of the Silver Ring Thing. The ring is a\nconstant reminder of the commitment made and sends a profound message to\neveryone who sees it.\n2. SRT Bible - abstinence study Bible with support material specific to students.\nA distinct connection between the Bible and e-mail follow-up provides depth and\nfurther understanding of the decision made.\n3. The Vow - a public promise to remain abstinent until marriage pledged by each\nstudent in a group setting. The Vow is signed and dated on the first page of the\nSRT Bible as a reminder and constant source of encouragement and support. [The\nVow reads, \"In signing this covenant before God Almighty, I                 ,\nagree to wear a silver ring as a sign of my pledge to abstain from sexual behavior\nthat is inconsistent with Biblical standards. On my wedding day, I will present my\nsilver ring to my spouse, representing my faithful commitment to the marriage\ncovenant.\"]\n4. A Faith Decision - in accepting the ring, the student accepts the reason for\nwearing it. The student understands that God has a plan for his or her life, and a\nplan for his or her sexuality. When the decision is faith-based, the student has the\npower of God working within them.\n5. Accountability Partner - within 48 hours, every student is asked to name an\naccountability partner of the same sex to encourage, share, and support his or her\ndecision.\n6. E-mail - SRT team members initiate e-mail contact with all students in an\nexhaustive effort to remain present in the daily lives of students. E-mails go out\ntwice a week for two months and help guide and direct students through the SRT\nBible and through daily circumstances.\n7. SRT Mentoring - Staff members readily available to answer questions and offer\nsupport via phone, instant messenger, e-mail, or personal visitation where\npossible.\n10\n\n8. CREW/Leadership training - SRT is a teen and peer-driven organization.\nStudents are taught leadership skills that strengthen the willpower to keep the vow\nand are given technical training of SRT systems and equipment. Joining Crew\nstrengthens the abstinence commitment.\n9. Youth Group - using contact information, students are encouraged and\n\"plugged-in\" to local youth networks for support and discipleship.\n10. Website - our website, www.silverringthing.com, provides information ibr\nupcoming shows, current issues, latest SRT news, pictures, etc. Areas such as\n\"Deb’s Diary,\" \"Ask the Doctor,\" and \"SRT Helpline\" provide honest answers to\nreal-life questions and challenges and help them understand the importance of an\nabstinence commitment.\n11. Abstinence Saturated Communities - SRT is aggressively expanding its\nnational and international reach and students become part of an every-growing\npeer group who will strengthen each other’s commitment. The goal is to perform\n20-30 events per year in each Hub city, where students can attend numerous\nshows and receive constant encouragement and positive peer pressure.\n12. Internship/Staff Opportunities - High school and college intern positions are\navailable along with full-time staffpositions in each developing Hub city. These\npositions provide strong bonds and fellowship, adding an additional level of\naccountability.\n52, On information and belief, there is no secular version of the twelve-step follow-up\nprogram.\n53. On information and belief, there is no SRT ring without inscribed biblical verses\n(see Step 1).\n54.    On information and belief, there is no SRT abstinence pledge without religious\ncontent (see Step 3).\n55, On information and belief, there is no SRT secular sexual abstinence study guide\n(see Step 2).\n56. The SRT Sexual Abstinence Study Bible (the \"SRT Study Bible\") (see Step 2)\npromotes religion. In particular, it preaches Christianity. According to the SRT Study Bible, for\nexample:\n11\n\na.     \"Abstinence without faith = Failure (It’s God’s idea!).\"\nb.     Among the top ten ingredients to remaining abstinent is \"Develop\nyour personal relationship with Jesus Christ.\"\nc. \"Jesus Christ [is] the Only Way to God ..I.f. humankind could\nhave reached God any other way, Jesus would not have had to die.\"\nd. You will go to hell if you have not accepted Jesus: \"If you have\naccepted God’s wonderful gift of salvation through his Son, Jesus Christ, your\nname will be found in the Book of Life, and you will spend eternity in heaven\nwith God. If you have chosen to reject Christ, then your final destination will be\nthe lake of fire. No arguments. Case closed.\" \"In hell, nonbelievers will be\ndoomed to exist in unending torment with the Devil and his demons ....\nNonbelievers will spend eternity in agony T...h.ose who know Christ have much\nto gain. Those who do not, have everything to lose.\"\nThese examples of religion content from ’/he SRT Bible are not\nexhaustive.\n57. An accountability partner is another step of the twelve-step SRT follow-up\nprogram. (See Step 5). According to the SRT website\n(http://ww~.silverringthing.com/partner.html), when accountability partners meet, they should\n\"[t]ake time to pray tbr each other\" and \"[s]hare with each other what the Lord has been teaching\nyou.\" Recommended questions accountability partners should ask each other include \"How has\nyour walk with God been going?\" and \"Do you need prayer for anything?\"\n12\n\n58.    On information and belief, all student participants, regardless of whether they\nattend the secular or religious version of the SRT Three-Hour Presentation, receive the same\nfollow-up e-mails from the SRT.\n59.    These SRT follow-up e-mails, which are designed to help students remain true to\ntheir abstinence pledge (see Step 6), are filled with religious content and promote Christianity.\na. For example, one email, sent December 14, 2004, informs readers\nthat they can. still put on a ring even if they have already had sex: \"Yes! You can\nstill put on a ring!!! It’s called STARTING OVER. Jesus meant every word that\nhe spoke about forgiveness. All you have to do is this:\nAcknowledge that you didn’t do things His way before.\nAccept the fact that He completely forgives you and you can start over.\nForgive yourselt~. Christ }brgives you, so let it go!\nCome to the next show and put on a ring as a symbol that you are waiting\nuntil your wedding day!\nDon’t let your past rule your life - let Christ. Also, for a little more\nencouragement, check out John 8:1-11 for a great example.\"\nb. Another e-mail, sent January 4, 2005, assures students that they\nwill be able to resist temptations because \"[i]n your time of need God will provide\nyou with whatever it takes to get away from, out of or to overcome the\ntemptation.\" The e-mail continues: \"When I find myself tempted, I just say a\nprayer right then and there, in my head without closing my eyes or anything, and I\nask Him for help. Usually it’s like, ’Hey God, what’s up, 1 need some help here\nand I know you’re the guy to ask. Thanks.’ Someway, somehow, God gives me\n13\n\nwhat I need to overcome the temptation, whatever it takes He provides. Imagine\nhow stoked God is up there in heaven when one of His children on earth stays\nstrong and shows Satan what’s what by overcoming temptation!\"\nc. These examples of religious content in the follow-up e-mails are\nnot exhaustive.\n60.    The SRT website, which students are advised to consult (see Step 10), is filled\nwith religious content and promotes religion.\n61.    For example, according to \"Deb’s Diary,\" a personal column on the website\nstudents are encouraged to consult:\na. \"Here are some ways you can strive to be pure: Pursue Faith. The\nonly way to keep strong in God is to read his word, talk to him and worship him\n24/7 .... Talk about God ....When you let others know about who you believe\nin, it not only strengthens your faith, but it lets them know where you stand on\ncertain issues.\" P-U-R-I-T-Y, Deb’s Diary\n( h ttp : / /’a,~-~v.silv crringthing.c om / d e b 26.h tml ).\nb. \"You don’t need anyone you are romantically interested in to\nCOMPLETE you, Honestly, the only person you need to complete you is Jesus.\nCome on - has anyone else taken it upon themselves to die for you lately?...\nYou are totally complete in Christ. There is no other person anywhere that could\ncomplete you.\" Deb’s Diary; Jerry McGuire Was Wrong\n(http://,a~aw, v.silv crringthing.com / de bO9.h tml ).\nc. These examples of religious content in \"Deb’s Diary\" are not\nexhaustive.\n14\n\n62. The SRT Newsletter, made available on the website, is also filled with religious\ncontent, as these following excerpts demonstrate:\na, \"Vision Now Reality: As the traveling crew continues to.do its\nwork in cities across America each week, more people are becoming part of this\nabstinence phenomenon. And ultimately, they are developing a relationship with\nJesus Christ. This is such good news! We want you to catch the vision that is\nnow a reality for us! As you read this edition of It’s Time, you’ll see how God is\nusing the John Guest Team and the Silver Ring Thing in powerful ways.\" April\n2004 Newsletter (http://w’a~v.silverringthing.com/images/srmewsCW324final.pdf).\nb. \"National Prayer Team Kick-Off: How would you like to be a\nprayer warrior for the Silver Ring Thing ministry? We are organizing a national\nteam of pray-ers who will commit to praying for the many aspects of the\nministry.\" May 2004 newsletter\n(http://www.silverringthing.com/images/srtnews5 5final.pdf).\nThese examples of religious content in the SRT newsletter are not\nexhaustive.\nD. Abstinence Education Special Congressional Initiative Project Grants\n63.    Each year for the past three years, Congress has set aside in its annual Omnibus\nAppropriations Bills special earmarks for abstinence education. These grants are known as\nAbstinence Education Special Congressional Initiative Project Grants (\"special abstinence\ngrants\").\n15\n\n64. According to the special abstinence grant guidelines, the funds are to be used to\npromote abstinence education, as defined by Section 510 of Title V of the Social Security Act, to\nstudents aged 12-18.\n65.    The grants are administered by the United States Department of Health and\nHuman Services (\"HHS\"). Since June 2004, the grants have been administered by the Family\nand Youth Services Bureau, a division of the Administration for Children and Families within\nHHS. Previously, the grants were administered by the Maternal Child and Health Bureau, a\ndivision of the Health Resources and Services Administration within HHS.\nE. Federal Funds Support Silver Ring Thing’s Religious Activity\n66.    The Silver Ring Thing has requested and received over one million dollars of\nfederal funds in the past three years. FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Public Law 108-7\n(February 20, 2003), 117 Stat. 11 (awarded for the time period August t, 2003 to July 31,2004);\nFY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Public Law 108-199 (January 23, 2004) 118 Stat. 39\n(awarded for the time period August 1, 2004 to July 3 I, 2005); FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations\nBill, Public Law 108-477 (December 8, 2004), 118 Stat. 2809 (for the time period August 1,\n2004 to July 31,2006).\n67.    On information and belief, these funds are used to support the Three-Hour\nPresentations and the Follow-Up Program.\n68.    For example, in fiscal year 2003, the SRT 2003 application for federal funds\n(which was granted) requested $335,450 of public funds for the salaries and benefits of positions\nthe SRT described as \"integral to the development and production of the Silver Ring Thing’s\nabstinence education and follow-up initiatives.\" Likewise, the SRT’s 2004 application for\n16\n\nfederal funds (which was likewise granted) proposed that the majority of its 2004 federal grant,\n$350,000, be used for salaries and benefits.\n69.    On information and belief, other federal funds have been used to support the\nThree-Hour Presentation and the Follow-Up Program. For example, according to SRT’s budget\nproposals, federal funds have been allocated for equipment and vehicles \"critical for producing\nthe SRT high tech sexual abstinence education program.\" This includes, for example, funds for\n\"the complete truss system used to set up all the sound, light, and video equipment for producing\na SRT show\" as well as \"vans... to transport the crew to shows all over the U.ST .h..e.se\nvehicles are needed to transport all of the program staff, crew, and equipment to all of the\nnational programs.\" Moreover, according to SRT’s budget proposals, federal funds have been\nallocated to support office space, supplies, and computers to be used by \"staff, interns,\nvolunteers, and crew. All of these people are integral to the development and production of the\nSRT abstinence education program and follow-up program.\"\n70.    On information and beliet; the special abstinence grants are awarded directly to\nthe Silver Ring Thing. The grants are not awarded as vouchers to individual students who then\ndecide to direct the funds to the Silver Ring Thing. Nor is the amount of the grants contingent on\nthe number of students participating in the Silver Ring Thing programs.\n71.    On information and belief, the Silver Ring Thing makes no effort to segregate\ngovernment funds for solely secular uses.\n72.    Defendants have failed to establish safeguards sufficient to prevent the SRT from\nusing government funds for religious activities and purposes.\n73.    in sum, SRT uses taxpayer dollars to promote religious content, instruction, and\nindoctrination.\n17\n\n74.    As a result of the above-described actions of Defendants, Plaintiff, on behalf of its\nmembers, has suffered irreparable injury.\nCAUSE OF ACTION\n(Violation of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution)\n75.    Plaintiffrealleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation\ncontained in paragraphs 1 through 74 as if set forth fully herein.\n76.    The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\nprovides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n77.    For the reasons set forth above, Defendants have violated the Establishment\nClause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nRELIEF REQUESTED\nWHEREFORE Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following\nrelief:\nI. a judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 declaring that Defendants’ actions, as set\nforth above, violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution;\n2. the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering Defendants and their\nagents, representatives, successors and those acting in concert with them to cease and\ndesist from disbursing federal funds to SRT;\n3. an award of costs and attorneys’ fees; and\n4. such further and other relief as this Court deems appropriate.\n18\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nSARAH WUNSCH (BBO #548767)\nACLU of Massachusetts\n99 Chauncy St., Suite 310\nBoston, MA 02111\n(617) 482-3170, ext. 323\nJUL1E STERNBERG*\nCAROLINE MALA CORBIN*\nACLU Reproductive Freedom Project\n125 Broad Street, 18th Floor\nNew York, New York 10004\n(212) 549-2633 (phone)\n(212) 549-2652 (fax)\nDANIEL MACH*\nVICTORIA JUEDS*\nTHOMAS PULHAM* i\nJESSICA TILLIPMAN*\nJenner & Block LLP\n601 Thirteenth St., NW\nSuite 1200 South\nWashington, DC 20005\n(202) 637-6313 (phone)\n(202) 661-4917 (fax)\nAttorneys for Plaintiff\nDated: May 16, 2005\n*Motion for Admission Pro Hac Vice Pending\niAdmitted in California only; practicing under the supervision of the partners of Jelmer & Block\nLLP.\n19",
