While the plaintiff suggests a different approach to lethal injection, he does not prove that the current method used by Missouri violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Further the Court is not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violates applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment. The Court also does not find that Missouri physicians who are involved in administering the lethal injections are violating their ethical obligations nor that the procedure is violative of the Thirteenth Amendment.

Further the Court is not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violates applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment. The Court also does not find that Missouri physicians who are involved in administering the lethal injections are violating their ethical obligations nor that the procedure is violative of the Thirteenth Amendment.

    "summary": "<p>On July 28, 2005 a death-sentenced inmate of the Potosi Correctional Center in Washington County, Missouri, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Missouri Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  He claimed that there was a 43% chance that the defendants' planned lethal injection procedure would torture him and cause him unnecessary pain.  He argued that this violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  He also argued that the infliction of the death penalty, and specifically the use of a form of execution more painful than necessary to bring about the death involved, violated the Thirteenth Amendment because it was a relict, vestige, and badge of slavery.  Specifically, he was concerned that that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection would require a painful \"cut-down\" procedure, and that the anesthetic used (thiopental) would wear off too soon, allowing him to be conscious during the administration of potassium chloride, which causes a painful burning sensation throughout the body.  In addition, the plaintiff argued that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.</p><p>The defendants asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming that the plaintiff had to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing the case in District Court.  On December 28, 2005, the District Court (Judge Scott O. Wright) denied their request, finding that the plaintiff did not have to exhaust his administrative remedies because if the defendants had wanted to change the method of execution due to the pain it inflicted, they would have already done so.  </p><p>On January 18, 2006, the plaintiff asked the District Court to order the defendants not to execute him until the court had held a hearing and decided how to resolve the issues in the case.  The next day, the District Court (Judge Wright) granted his request and ordered the defendants not to execute the plaintiff until the court told them that they could do so.  The defendants appealed.  On January 29, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Judges William J. Riley, Clarence Arlen Beam, and David Rasmussen Hansen) vacated the stay and ordered the District Court to hold a hearing before noon on February 1, 2006.  They also held that the execution should be stayed until midnight on February 3, 2006.  </p><p>According to the Eighth Circuit's order, the District Court held a hearing to decide the merits of the case on January 31, 2006.  After the hearing, Court (Judge Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr.) found that neither the chemicals used by the State of Missouri for lethal injection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections constituted cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court reasoned that while the plaintiff suggested a different approach to lethal injection, he did not prove that the current method used by Missouri violated the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Court also said that it was not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violated applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment, and it did not believe that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.  Finally, the Court said that the lethal injection procedure did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of slavery.  The plaintiff appealed.  </p><p>On April 27, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judges Riley, Beam, and Hansen) issued a per curiam opinion vacating the District Court's decision and remanding the case so that the lower court could hold a more thorough hearing and expand the record.  The Eighth Circuit decided to do this because they felt that the time constraints that they had imposed on the lower court had been unreasonable, and they wished to allow the parties more time to present their cases.  Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095 (8th Cir. 2006).</p><p>After holding a more extensive hearing, the District Court ruled on June 26, 2006, amended its earlier decision, ordering the defendants to prepare a written protocol for lethal injections that included the following changes:  1) a board certified anesthesiologist must be responsible for the mixing and administering of all drugs used during the lethal injection, 2) at least 5 grams of thiopental must be administered and the anesthesiologist must certify that the thiopental has rendered the plaintiff unconscious, 3) the state must purchase any equipment necessary to allow the anesthesiologist to monitor the depth of the anesthetic, in order to insure that the plaintiff will not feel any pain, 4) the state must have a contingency plan in place in case problems develop during the execution procedure, 5) an auditing process must be in place to ensure that all individuals involved in the lethal injection process are correctly following the protocol, and 6) after the Court approves the lethal injection protocol, it must not be changed without the prior approval of the Court.  The District Court then sent this ruling up to the Eighth Circuit for their consideration and approval.  Taylor v. Crawford, 2006 WL 1779035 (W.D.Mo. June 26, 2006).</p><p>On July 24, 2006, the defendants filed a revised protocol for use in carrying out the inmate's death sentence in the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit remanded their jurisdiction back to the lower court so that the new protocol could be considered.  On September 12, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) rejected the defendants' revised protocol, saying that even though it was an improvement, it was not enough to meet the standards of the Constitution because it lacked a provision for purchase of equipment that allows monitoring of anesthetic depth.  The Court ordered the defendants to submit a revised protocol to the Court by October 27, 2006.  </p><p>The defendants asked the District Court to reconsider their rejection of the revised protocol, and on October 16, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) refused to reconsider the decision.  The defendants appealed that refusal, and on June 4, 2007, the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the defendants' proposed revisions of the protocol were sufficient to get rid of any Constitutional problems.  They also vacated the District Court's injunction that had forbidden the defendants from executing the plaintiff.  The plaintiff asked the Eighth Circuit to rehear the case en banc, and on August 8, 2007, the Eighth Circuit declined to do so.  The plaintiff filed a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.</p><p>Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon denied the inmate's request for clemency and he was executed on February 25, 2014.</p>",

"THIS IS A CAPITAL CASE \nEighth Circuit stay expires at 5:00 p.m. CST \nNo. _______ \n \nIn The \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n__________________________ \n \nMICHAEL ANTHONY TAYLOR, \n \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nLARRY CRAWFORD, \nDirector, Department of Corrections, State of Missouri, \n \nand \n \nJAMES D. PURKETT, \nSuperintendent, Eastern Reception, Diagnostic & Correctional Center, \n \nRespondents. \n__________________________ \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals \n__________________________ \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL SUGGESTIONS IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION \nFOR STAY OF EXECUTION \n__________________________ \n \nCOMES NOW the petitioner, by and through counsel, and files these \nsupplemental suggestions in support of his application for stay of \nexecution. \n\nAs noted in Mr. Taylor’s initial pleading, this court must apply the \nstandards of  Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 US 1306, 1308 (1980) to this motion.  \nApplying that standard here requires a stay.  \nIn addition to the fact that is court has pending before it two similar \ncases, the particular facts of this case also support the prongs of the test \nthat there is a reasonable probability that this Court will grant certiorari \nand a substantial likelihood of relief. \nMr. Taylor’s §1983 motion, unlike that of Mr. Bieghler, to whom this \ncourt recently denied relief, was pending for six months when the Missouri \nSupreme Court set a date for Mr. Taylor’s execution.  As noted in previous \npleadings, the Missouri Supreme Court created the current time urgency \nby setting the date for execution before the defendants in the §1983 action \nhad even filed an answer to the plaintiffs’ petition. \nIn response, the district court acted with due respect both to the \ninterests of the defendants and the plaintiffs. It set a hearing on the merits \nless than 30 days after the scheduled execution, and stayed the execution \npending the hearing.  The Eighth Circuit instead directed that a hearing be \nheld before the execution date.  The order was issued on a Sunday \nafternoon, and Mr. Taylor’s counsel did not become aware of it until \nJanuary 30, 2006, the day the hearing was scheduled to begin. \n‐ 2 ‐ \n\nBoth the district court and the defendants implicitly conceded that a \nfair hearing was improper when the defendants did not oppose, and the \ncourt granted, the motion of intervenor plaintiff Richard Clay to withdraw \non the grounds that such an unfair hearing should not be binding on him. \nIn order to accommodate the unreasonable order of the court of \nappeals, the district court unreasonably truncated the hearing.  In his \nappeal, Mr. Taylor has presented two specific instances of prejudice arising \nfrom this limitation that prevented him, in violation of his rights to due \nprocess of law, from fairly presenting his civil rights claim to the district \ncourt. \nTo obtain a judgment that Missouri’s method of lethal injection did \nnot constitute cruel and unusual punishment, the defendants relied \nexclusively on testimony from experts about the way in which the process \nshould work.  Despite the fact that this protocol has been used, according to \nthe state, for approximately five years, the district court refused to require \nthe state to make available the medical professionals who actually carry it \nout so that the plaintiffs could adduce evidence about how the process \nworks in practice.  Nor would the court allow the plaintiffs to investigate \nindependently whether those professionals in fact had the qualifications \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\nthe defendants said they had, or what their experience was with the \nparticular processes involved in the Missouri protocol. \nThis is particularly important because there are inherent problems \nwith Missouri’s method of execution.  Intravenous access is gained via the \nfemoral (leg) vein, using a sophisticated medical procedure that involves \nthe insertion of a guidewire and a large than normal intravenous catheter.  \nThis is an unnecessary, painful procedure that is used in spite of the fact \nthat there are other less painful and safer ways to gain intravenous access.  \nFurther, Missouri, which uses a three chemical sequence of thiopental, \npancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride, makes no provision for \nmonitoring the prisoner’s level of anesthesia prior to administration of the \nlatter two drugs.  Reasonable medical standards call for careful monitoring \nof anesthesia whenever a barbiturate (such as sodium thiopental) is used in \nconjunction with a muscle relaxer (such as pancuronium bromide.)  This is \nbecause the muscle relaxer will paralyze the patient and prevent him from \ncommunicating his pain and suffering if the barbiturate is not at the proper \nlevel in his brain.   \nAs noted in the declaration of Dr. Sri Melethil, previously provided \nto this court, certain persons have “acute tolerance” to sodium thiopental.  \nThese people will awaken despite the administration of a dosage of the \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\ndrug which would ordinarily cause sleep.  Missouri makes no provision for \ndetermining whether this has happened during the execution process.  The \nphenomenon is common enough that reasonable medical standards require \nthat precautions be taken to avoid it.  \nDr. Melethil’s evidence was not presented to the district court \nbecause he was traveling and did not learn of the immediate hearing until \nJanuary 31, 2006, when it was already in progress; his previous \ncommitments made it impossible for him to participate that day.  His \ndeclaration was filed the next day, but the district court issued its ruling on \nthe evening of January 31.1  Thus, in addition to forbidding Mr. Taylor \nfrom presenting relevant and necessary fact witnesses, the district court \nprevented him from presenting relevant expert testimony. \nMr. Taylor presented the testimony of two experts at the truncated \nhearing despite the lack of notice.  The district court relied heavily on the \ncredibility of the state’s expert in the absence of fact witnesses and the \ntestimony of a pharmacokineticist such as Dr. Melethil.  Had a full hearing \nbeen conducted, there is a reasonable probability that the district court \nwould have ruled otherwise. \n                                                 \n1 Dr. Melethil’s declaration indicates that he had been involved with the case \nsince September, 2005; he was not a last‐minute addition to Mr. Taylor’s evidence. \n‐ 5 ‐ \n\nWHEREFORE, for the reasons presented in his application for stay \nand in this pleading, the petitioner prays the Court for its order granting a \nstay of execution pending this Court’s disposition of his petition for a writ \nof certiorari to review the judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand if certiorari is granted, pending the final disposition of his cause in this \ncourt.. \n

Missouri, \nCentral Division. \nMichael Anthony TAYLOR, Plaintiff, \nv. \nLarry CRAWFORD, et al., Defendants. \nNo. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG. | June 26, 2006. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nEric Berger, Ginger Anders, Jenner & Block LLP, Matthew S. Hellman, Jenner & Block, LLC, Donald B. Verrilli, \nWashington, DC, John William Simon, John William Simon, J.D., Ph.D., St. Louis, MO, for Plaintiff. \nMichael Pritchett, Missouri Attorney General, Jefferson City, MO, for Defendants. \nOpinion \n \nORDER \nFERNANDO J. GAITAN, JR., District Judge. \n \nI. BACKGROUND \n*1 Plaintiff filed his Complaint on June 3, 2005, and an amended complaint on September 12, 2005 (Doc. # 36)1. In his First \nAmended Complaint plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that Missouri’s method of execution by lethal injection violates \nthe Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments because it would inflict on him cruel and unusual punishment, would \ndeprive him of life, liberty or property without due process of law and would inflict upon him a badge of slavery, in that the \nthree drug sequence using a procedure whereby the drugs are administered through the femoral artery creates a foreseeable \nrisk of the infliction of gratuitous pain. Plaintiff also argued that the physician’s role in the execution violated medical ethics. \nOn December 28, 2005, the Court issued an Order denying defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and ruling that the case presented \nfactual issues which would likely be resolved by either a motion for summary judgment or through a hearing (Doc. # 54). On \nJanuary 3, 2006, the defendants notified the Court that the Supreme Court of Missouri had set plaintiff’s execution date for \nFebruary 1, 2006. On January 18, 2006, plaintiff filed an Application for a Court Order requesting that the Court issue an \nOrder directing that Taylor not be executed until further order of the Court to be issued within a reasonable time after a \nhearing on the merits which was scheduled for February 21, 2006. On January 19, 2006, Judge Scott Wright issued an Order \nstaying the execution until the Court could conduct the hearing (Doc. # 62). The same day, defendants appealed Judge \nWright’s ruling to the Eighth Circuit. On January 29, 2006, the Eighth Circuit entered an Order reversing and vacating Judge \nWright’s January 19, 2006 Order. The Eighth Circuit remanded the case to the Western District and directed that the Court \nreassign the case to another judge for an immediate hearing. The Eighth Circuit directed that an Order be issued no later than \n12:00 Noon on Wednesday, February 1, 2006. This case was assigned to this Court on Monday, January 30, 2006. \n  \nOn January 30-31, 2006, this Court conducted a telephonic hearing regarding plaintiff’s Complaint. During the telephonic \nhearing, the Court heard the testimony of the following individuals: Dr. Mark Dershwitz, Dr. Jonathan I. Groner, Dr. Mark \nHeath and Terry W. Moore, the Director of Adult Institutions for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Plaintiff requested \nthat the State produce John Doe Numbers One and Two (the doctor and the nurse who participated in the most recent \nexecution),  but  this  request  was  denied.  Plaintiff  also  sought  to  present  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Sri  Melethil,  a \npharmacokineticist, but he was out of town and unable to appear until the morning of February 1, 2006. After considering the \n  1 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nevidence and the testimony of these individuals, the Court determined that neither the chemicals used by the State for lethal \ninjection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections constituted cruel or unusual punishment. The Court noted \nthat while the plaintiff suggested a different approach to lethal injection, he had not shown that the current method used by \nMissouri violated the Eighth Amendment. Further the Court was not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the \nadministration of the lethal injection violated applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment. The Court also did not find that \nMissouri physicians who are involved in administering lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations or that the \nprocedure was violative of the Thirteenth Amendment. \n  \n*2 Plaintiff appealed this Court’s January 31, 2006 Order, arguing that he did not have sufficient time to present his \narguments to the Court during the two day telephonic hearing. Plaintiff argued that this Court had abused its discretion in not \nallowing him to call John Doe I and II or Dr. Melethil and also erred in denying his claims. On April 27, 2006, the Eighth \nCircuit remanded the case to this Court to reconvene the hearing. The Eighth Circuit gave the parties thirty days to engage in \nsome limited additional discovery and then an additional thirty days within which the hearing was to be held and for this \nCourt to issue its Order, amending, modifying or restating the previous judgment and certifying the same to the Eighth \nCircuit. \n  \nThe Court allowed plaintiff to conduct the following discovery: a Rule 34 inspection and videotaped tour of Missouri’s \nexecution chamber, a deposition of Larry Crawford, Director of the Missouri Department of Corrections and document \nrequests which pertained to the last six executions carried out by the State of Missouri. The document requests included any \nexecution logs, records, autopsy reports, test results and analyses of post-mortem/toxicology reports. The State also provided \ninformation regarding what specialized training the physicians and nurses undergo who participate in administration of the \ndrugs and all documents pertaining to any fall back procedures regarding vein access and the three drug sequence. The Court \nalso allowed plaintiff to submit interrogatories to John Doe Defendants I-V. After John Doe I submitted his interrogatory \nresponses, plaintiff again asked the Court for permission to depose him. The Court allowed plaintiff to conduct a limited \nanonymous deposition of John Doe I. This deposition was conducted at the Courthouse, with only the Court and counsel \npresent. On June 12 -13, 2006 this Court continued the hearing which was begun in January 2006. During the hearing, \nplaintiff presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Heath, an anesthesiologist, Dr. Stephen Johnson, an expert in central line \nplacement and femoral line placement and Dr. Thomas Henthorn, an expert in pharmokinetics. The State presented the \ntestimony of Dr. Mark Dershwitz, an anesthesiologist, Terry Moore, Director of Adult Institutions for Department of \nCorrections and Larry Crawford, Director of the Department of Corrections. \n  \n \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Standard \nThe Eighth Amendment provides that “cruel and unusual punishment” shall not be inflicted. It prohibits punishments that are \n“incompatible with the ‘evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ “ Estelle v. Gamble 429 \nU.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 \nL.Ed.2d 630 (1958)). As to executions, it prohibits “the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” as well as methods \ninvolving torture or a lingering death. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). \n“The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the \nnecessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.” Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, \n329 U.S. 459, 464, 67 S.Ct. 374, 376, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947)(emphasis added). Additionally, as the Court noted in Campbell v. \nWood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir.1994), “[t]he risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution process \nin order to survive constitutional review.” \n  \n \nB. Missouri’s Execution Procedure \n*3 During the January 30-31, 2006 hearing, Terry Moore, Director of Adult Institutions for the Missouri Department of \nCorrections, described what he believed was the execution procedure used in Missouri. Mr. Moore testified that three drugs \nare administered by a board certified physician. The physician first administers five grams of sodium pentothal, also known \nas thiopental, which is a substance that produces anesthesia. Thereafter, the physician administers a syringe of saline to flush \nthe IV line. Next, the physician administers pancuronium bromide, also referred to as pancuronium. This drug is a paralytic \nagent which prevents any involuntary movement of the body. The physician then again administers the saline solution. \n  2 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nFinally, the third drug which is administered is potassium chloride, which is a drug which stops the electrical activity of the \nheart. There was no dispute that if an inmate is not sufficiently anesthetized when the potassium chloride is administered, it \nwill cause excruciating pain as it is administered through the inmate’s veins. The inmate, however, would be unable to show \nthat he was experiencing discomfort due to the paralyzing effects of the pancuronium bromide. \n  \nAfter the Eighth Circuit remanded this case, the Court allowed plaintiff to conduct additional limited discovery. In a letter \nsent to the Court on May 17, 2006, plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that new evidence in the form of chemical \ndispensary logs, which had recently been produced by the State, contradicted the State’s previous representations regarding \nthe amount of thiopental that is used during executions. \n  \nIn response, counsel for the State confirmed in a letter sent to the Court on May 17, 2006 that 5 grams of sodium pentothal \nare used: \nAs plaintiff correctly points out, defendants have stated consistently that 5 grams of sodium pentothal \nare used in executions in Missouri. Five grams are in fact used. The reference to the 2.5 grams noted in \nthe drug log is not correct. The doctor and the nurse who have prepared the drugs for the last six \nexecutions and for plaintiff’s stayed execution confirm that 5 grams has been used in the last six \nexecutions and was prepared for plaintiff’s stayed execution. (Defendants are attempting to run down \nthe source of the error in the record, and continue to do so.) \nHowever, the next day on May 18, 2006, counsel for the State sent the Court another letter in which they acknowledge that a \nmistake had in fact been made regarding the representations as to the amount of thiopental administered. The letter stated in \npart: \nUpon  further  review,  defendants  have  just  determined  this  afternoon,  contrary  to  previous \nrepresentations, that 2.5 grams of sodium pentothal was prepared and used at the last execution (not 5 \ngrams) and that 2.5 grams was prepared for use at the execution of plaintiff (which was stayed before \nthe femoral IV was inserted). Defendants and their counsel apologize to the Court and the parties for \nproviding incorrect information. \n*4 (Doc. # 121). \n  \nUpon learning of this information, the Court submitted a set of interrogatories to John Doe I2 to answer. The Court inquired \nwhether the lethal injection protocol was codified in any publication, policy statement or state regulation. John Doe I \nresponded that he was not aware of the protocol being written down in any form. He stated that it was his understanding at \nthe time of Mr. Gray’s execution that he had the independent authority to change the dose based on his medical judgment. He \nstated that this understanding was based on past contacts with predecessors of the current Director of the Department of \nCorrections. When the Court asked how many times the protocol has been modified since it was put into place, John Doe I \nresponded: \n  \nJohn Doe I can recall one instance when three syringes of potassium chloride were used based on the obesity of the \noffender. John Doe I can recall one instance when the IV was inserted in the offender’s neck instead of his femoral vein \nbased on the damage to both of his femoral veins from drug abuse. John Doe I is aware of one instance when a peripheral \nIV was used because John Doe I was unable to attend the execution. For the execution of Mr. Gray and the preparation for \nthe execution of Mr. Taylor, John Doe I determined to use 2.5 grams of sodium pentothal. This determination occurred \nbecause of difficulty in dissolving powder, obtained from a new supplier, containing more than 2.5 grams in the liquid that \ncould be accommodated in a syringe. The rate of infusion and the concentration of the dose ensured that 2.5 grams was \nmore than sufficient to make the offender unconscious before administering the remaining drugs. Further, with regard to \nMr. Taylor, John Doe I was aware that the dosage used in the execution of Mr. Gray was adequate. \n(Response to Interrogatory No. 5, Doc. # 152). \nWhen asked who was consulted before the dosage of thiopental was decreased, he responded that no one was consulted \nbecause he thought it was within the acceptable parameters to accomplish the goal. When questioned about his medical \nbackground, John Doe stated that although he was a board certified surgeon, he is not an anesthesiologist. The Court also \nallowed plaintiff to conduct an anonymous deposition of John Doe I on June 5, 2006. \n  \nWhen he was asked whether any part of the execution procedure was written down, John Doe I responded as follows: \n  3 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nA. I have never seen it. If it was, it would have been written on my recommendation. \nQ. I see. Do you have any idea why it might not be written down? \nA. I’m sure it’s written down somewhere. If they’re checking the logs of all the drugs every time we use them and \nrecording expiration dates and number of sheets and needles that we use, I’m certain they have it written down somewhere. \nQ. But in terms of the aspects of the procedure that you’re responsible for, that you perform, those aren’t written down, to \nyour knowledge? \nA. It might be written in there, but it would be written on by somebody observing what I was doing and using their \ninterpretation. So if there was a written procedure that they had done I would-you know, I’m curious to see what they think \nI’m doing, but I don’t know that they write down the individual details of how I insert an 18-gauge rather than a 22-gauge \nor a 14-gauge needle. \n*5 Q. I see. So people might write things down as you’re doing them, but there’s no guide that you follow as you’re doing \nit? \nA. Absolutely not. \nQ. So you just rely on your memory? \nA. Yes. \nQ. And your judgment? \nA. Yes. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 69-70) \n  \nDuring his deposition, John Doe I described how he has had to devise an improvised procedure with regard to mixing the \ncorrect dosage of thiopental: \nQ. And could you take me step-by-step through that, your improvised process? \nA. I’d have to see the containers because I cannot at the present time remember whether they have glass or-they are \nactually just two straight-walled glass bottles. One has powder in the bottom, one has liquid in the bottom, and they are \ndesigned to lock together and mix. So, I have to stick a needle through this plastic and inject my own diluents which I \nknow will give me no more than 50 cc’s for the final product, which is what I’m aiming for for the final injection. \nWe have encountered problems trying to mix more than three or four grams using this method, mainly because of an inert \nsubstance possibly put in by the manufacturer to prevent mis-mixing, which I know several drug companies will do. So \nright now the last time I saw and talked to the Director on each of these occasions saying we either need to change what we \nsay we’re dosing or we will have to go back to the original five-gram bottle that was available when we instituted this \nprocedure. So right now we’re still improvising. And he’s also having me researching an alternate drug if it comes to that. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 9-10). \n  \nWhen John Doe I was asked why he did not initially recall why he prepared a smaller dose of thiopental, he responded: \nA .... But I am dyslexic and so I can recall in the operating room specific facts and details of \noperation and function perfectly, but in terms of copying one line to another or trying to simply copy \na phone number or account number I will sometimes transpose numbers even when I’m staring at \nthe two numbers. So, it’s not unusual for me to make mistakes.... But I am dyslexic and that is the \nreason why there are inconsistencies in my testimony. That’s why there are inconsistencies in what \nI call drugs. I can make these mistakes, but it’s not medically crucial in the type of work I do as a \nsurgeon. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 24-25)(emphasis added). \n  4 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \n  \nIn describing how the drugs are administered, John Doe I stated that, “... the people who do the injections are nonmedical and \nthey’re in the dark so they have a small flashlight that they’re able to quickly identify the syringes, make the appropriate \nconnections and injections, disconnect, clamp the tube, and changing the number of syringes or the order of syringes was an \nunnecessary risk.” (John Doe Depo. p. 31). \n  \nWhen questioned about whether he monitors anesthetic depth, John Doe I testified as follows: \nQ. Did you monitor Mr. Gray’s anesthetic depth during the execution? \n*6 A. I monitor-the only thing that can be monitored is facial expression, and you can judge when the effect of the drug is \naccomplished, and that can be seen from across a room through a window. And when that effect occurs then I know the \ninmate is unconscious.... \nQ. So you said that you can see that-an inmate’s facial expression from where you stand? \nA. Yes. That’s the only thing any anesthesiologist uses in the course of inducing a person when pentothal was still used, \nwas you simply started injecting, look at the face, and again, it’s difficult to describe, but I can tell instantly when the \npentothal has taken effect. And in medical practice the instant the pentothal has taken effect they gave absolutely no more \nbecause then they move on to the actual anesthesia which has to be started before the pentothal wears off. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 41-42). \n  \nWhen he was asked whether he had any discussions with Director Crawford about the scope of his authority, John Doe I \nstated: \nA. Oh, yes. We talk-I talk in his office and at the time of the execution. In fact, he’s the only director I have actually gone \nover to his office for other reasons and visited about this. And again, he has no background in corrections and he has no \nbackground in medicine, so the other corrections officers had long backgrounds in corrections so they were aware of what \nwe were doing and why we were doing it. Since he has no background in either field, he reiterated that he’s totally \ndependent on me advising him what could and should and will be done, and he will back up-if I think there’s a change that \nneeds to be made, he wants me to quickly inform him so he can make the appropriate changes. \nQ. I see. So, it’s your understanding that if you thought a change to the execution procedure needed to be made you \nwould-Director Crawford would defer to your opinion? \nA. Absolutely. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 63-64). \n  \n \nC. Is Missouri’s Execution Procedure Constitutional? \nIn Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp.2d 1037 (N.D.Cal.2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 126 S.Ct.1314, \n163 L.Ed.2d 1148 (2006), the Court stated: \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments that are incompatible with the evolving standards of \ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.... Executions that involve the unnecessary and \nwanton infliction of pain ... or that involve torture or a lingering death ... are not permitted. When \nanalyzing a particular method of execution or the implementation thereof, it is appropriate to focus on \nthe objective evidence of the pain involved.... In this case, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff \nis subject to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain or suffering such that his execution by lethal \ninjection under California’s protocol must be restrained. \nId. at 1039 (internal citations and quotations omitted)(emphasis added). In that case the Court focused on the narrow issue of \n“whether or not there is a reasonable possibility that Plaintiff will be conscious when he is injected with pancuronium \nbromide or potassium chloride, and, if so, how the risk of such an occurrence may be avoided.” Id. at 1040. This is precisely \nthe same question which this Court must address. \n  \n  5 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \n*7 After learning more about how executions are carried out in Missouri, through the interrogatories submitted to the John \nDoe defendants, reviewing the chemical dispensary logs, reviewing the videotape of the execution chamber and listening to \nthe testimony of John Doe I, and to the testimony of the other expert witnesses at the June 12-13, 2006 hearing, it is apparent \nthat  there  are  numerous  problems.  For  example,  there  is  no  written  protocol  which  describes  which  drugs  will  be \nadministered, in what amounts and defines how they will be administered. John Doe I testified that he came up with the \ncurrent protocol. John Doe I also testified that he felt that he had the authority to change or modify the formula as he saw fit. \nIt is apparent that he has changed and modified the protocol on several occasions in the past. He has reduced the amount of \nthiopental given from 5.0 grams to 2.5 grams and has also changed the location on the inmate’s body where the drugs were \nadministered. It is obvious that the protocol as it currently exists is not carried out consistently and is subject to change at a \nmoment’s notice. \n  \nThe Court is also concerned that John Doe I possesses total discretion for the execution protocol. Currently, there are no \nchecks and balances or oversight, either before, during or after the lethal injection occurs. No one monitors the changes or \nmodifications that John Doe I makes. John Doe I even testified that the Director of the Department of Corrections, Mr. \nCrawford, has no medical or corrections background, and that he is “totally dependent on me advising him.” (John Doe \nDepo. p. 64). \n  \nIn addition to the fact that there is no oversight and the responsibility for making changes or adjustments is completely vested \nin one individual, the Court also has concerns about John Doe I’s qualifications. John Doe I readily admitted that he is \ndyslexic and that he has difficulty with numbers and oftentimes transposes numbers. John Doe I testified “it’s not unusual for \nme to make mistakes.... But I am dyslexic and that is the reason why there are inconsistencies in my testimony. That’s why \nthere are inconsistencies in what I call drugs. I can make these mistakes, but it’s not medically crucial in the type of work I do \nas a surgeon .” (John Doe Depo. p. 25). The Court disagrees and is gravely concerned that a physician who is solely \nresponsible for correctly mixing the drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of condemned inmates has \na condition which causes him confusion with regard to numbers. As the Court has learned, the process of mixing the three \ndifferent drugs and knowing the correct amount of the drugs to dissolve in the correct amount of solution involves precise \nmeasurements and the ability to use, decipher, and not confuse numbers. Although John Doe I does not feel this is crucial in \nthe type of work he does as a surgeon, it is critical when one is mixing and dissolving chemicals for a lethal injection. \n  \n*8 In addition, John Doe I testified that although he is not an anesthesiologist, he monitors the anesthetic depth of an inmate \nby observing the inmate’s facial expression. However, as can be seen from the videotape of the execution chamber, when the \ninmate is lying on the gurney in the execution room, the inmate is facing away from the Operations room where John Doe I is \nlocated. Additionally, it is dark in the Operations room and there are blinds on the window which are partially closed and \nobstruct the view. This would make it almost impossible for John Doe I to observe the inmate’s facial expression. This leads \nthe Court to conclude that there is little or no monitoring of the inmate to ensure that he has received an adequate dose of \nanesthesia before the other two chemicals are administered. \n  \nAll of these concerns lead the Court to conclude that Missouri’s lethal injection procedure subjects condemned inmates to an \nunnecessary risk that they will be subject to unconstitutional pain and suffering when the lethal injection drugs are \nadministered. \n  \n \nD. Revisions to the Execution Protocol \nHaving determined that Missouri’s current method of administering lethal injections subjects condemned inmates to an \nunacceptable risk of suffering unconstitutional pain and suffering, the Court concludes that it is within its equitable powers to \nfashion  a  remedy  that  “preserves  both  the  State’s  interest  in  proceeding  with  Plaintiff’s  execution  and  Plaintiff’s \nconstitutional right not to be subject to an undue risk of extreme pain.” Morales, 415 F.Supp .2d at 1046. Director Crawford \ntestified at the hearing that the Department of Corrections is in the process of developing a directive which would establish a \nprotocol for administering lethal injections. However, from his testimony, it was apparent that the directive would not \nencompass all of the attributes which the Court finds are necessary to ensure that lethal injections are carried out humanely. \nRecently other courts have also faced this challenge and have modified execution procedures in those states. See e.g. Brown \nv. Beck, No. 5:06-CT-3018-H, (E.D.N.C. April 7, 2006)(Doc. No.32) and Morales, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1046. \n  \nAccordingly, the Court hereby AMENDS its previous order of January 31, 2006 and ORDERS the Department of \nCorrections for the State of Missouri to prepare a written protocol for the implementation of lethal injections which \nincorporates the following provisions: \n  \n  6 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \n \n1. Personnel \nA board certified anesthesiologist shall be responsible for the mixing of all drugs which are used in the lethal injection \nprocess. If the anesthesiologist does not actually administer the drugs through the IV, he or she shall directly observe those \nindividuals who do so. Additionally, the Operations Room shall be sufficiently lighted so that the corrections personnel can \nsee which drugs are being administered. \n  \n \n2. Lethal Injection Drugs & Method of Administration \n*9 The level of thiopental administered shall not be less than 5 grams. Pancuronium Bromide and Potassium Chloride will \nnot be administered until the anesthesiologist certifies that the inmate has achieved sufficient anesthetic depth so that the \ninmate  will  not  feel  any  undue  pain  when  the  Potassium  Chloride  is  injected.  The  State  in  conjunction  with  the \nanesthesiologist will have discretion to determine the most appropriate location on the inmate’s body to inject the drugs. The \nState shall specify in the protocol how the anesthesiologist will certify that the inmate has achieved the appropriate anesthetic \ndepth. \n  \n \n3. Monitoring \nThe State will put in place procedures which will allow the anesthesiologist to adequately monitor the anesthetic depth of the \ninmate. This may require the State to purchase additional equipment in order to adequately monitor anesthetic depth. The \nState should also consider repositioning the gurney so that the inmates’s face will be visible to the anesthesiologist, using a \nmirror, or even allowing the anesthesiologist to be present in the room with the inmate when the drugs are injected. \n  \n \n4. Contingency Plan \nThe State’s protocol shall also contain a contingency plan in case problems develop during the execution procedure. \n  \n \n5. Auditing Process \nThe Department of Corrections shall put in place an auditing process which will ensure that the individuals involved in the \nlethal injection process are correctly following the protocol, including administering the correct dosages of the medication, in \nthe proper order. The Court contemplates that the State will consult with a board certified anesthesiologist in designing the \nauditing process. \n  \n \n6. Changes to the Lethal Injection Procedure \nAfter approval by the Court, no further changes shall be made to the lethal injection protocol without seeking the prior \napproval of this Court. This Order contemplates consultation with a board certified anesthesiologist in arriving at a proposed \nwritten protocol. The Court will retain jurisdiction over the State’s implementation of the lethal injection protocol for the next \nsix executions or until the Court is satisfied that the protocol is being administered in a consistent fashion. The Department of \nCorrections shall submit its revised lethal execution protocol to this Court for review and approval on or before July 15, \n2006. All executions in the State of Missouri are hereby STAYED pending approval of the protocol. \n  \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court hereby AMENDS its January 31, 2006 Order and in accordance with the April 27, \n2006 Order of the Eighth Circuit, this Court hereby CERTIFIES this Order to the Eighth Circuit for its review and \nconsideration. \n  \n  7 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nFootnotes \n \n1  Richard Clay was previously granted leave to intervene in this action. On January 30, 2006, the Court orally granted Mr. Clay’s \n  Motion to Dismiss this action as to him without prejudice. Reginald Clemons also had a pending Motion for Leave to Intervene in \nthis action. He has now also moved to withdraw from this action. \n \n2  Defendants have disclosed that John Doe I is the physician that mixes the drugs used during the executions. \n   \n \n \n \n  8 \n ",

Missouri, Central Division. \nMichael Anthony TAYLOR Plaintiff, \nv. \nLarry CRAWFORD, et al., Defendants. \nNo. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG. | May 30, 2006. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nGinger Anders, Jenner & Block LLP, Donald B. Verrilli, Eric Berger, Matthew S. Hellman, Washington, DC, John William \nSimon, St. Louis, MO, for Plaintiff. \nMichael Pritchett, Missouri Attorney General, Jefferson City, MO, for Defendants. \nOpinion \n \nORDER \nGAITAN, J. \n*1 Currently pending before the Court is plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider (Doc. # 160). Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider \nthe procedure which the Court proposed in its May 26, 2006 Order regarding the deposition of John Doe No. 1. Plaintiff’s \narguments fall into three categories: 1) The Court should not conduct the questioning of John Doe No. 1; 2) Plaintiff should \nnot have been required to disclose all his questions in advance because this will allow John Doe No. 1 time to consider his \nanswers in advance and also possibly allow for coaching by counsel; and 3) The questioning should not be limited to the \nthree areas outlined by the Court. \n  \nBefore addressing plaintiff’s concerns, the Court notes that this case is not like a traditional civil case where the parties would \nhave several months to pursue discovery. The Eighth Circuit gave the parties thirty days to conduct discovery and gave the \nCourt thirty days to hold a hearing and issue an Order. This case was remanded in order that “some further discovery” could \nbe conducted. However, the Eighth Circuit gave this Court discretion over what discovery would be allowed and how it \nwould be conducted. The Court warned the parties at the outset, that discovery would be limited to only those witnesses and \nareas necessary to address the issues before the Court. The remand was not an open invitation for plaintiff’s counsel to \nconduct a full scale investigation into Missouri’s lethal injection protocol. During discovery, it has become apparent that \nthere  have  been  deviations  in  the  lethal  injection  protocol.  This  development  justified  the  propounding  of  limited \ninterrogatories to John Doe No. 1. After having reviewed the interrogatory responses, the Court felt that some additional \nquestions were justified to clarify and further develop some very limited areas, which the Court outlined in its Order. The \nCourt never intended to allow plaintiff to conduct a comprehensive deposition of John Doe No. 1, as it would have if this \ncase were on a normal discovery schedule. That is why the Court asked plaintiff to submit the questions to the Court in \nadvance, so that the Court could review the questions and determine whether they were beyond the scope of what the Court \nwould allow. Plaintiff seems to believe that this procedure has somehow prejudiced him, because John Doe. No. 1 will have \nan opportunity to review the questions and consult with counsel in advance of his deposition. However, the Court does not \nfind that this procedure unnecessarily prejudices him. If plaintiff’s counsel truly believed that they were prejudiced by having \nto submit the questions in advance, they could have requested leave to submit the questions to the Court in camera. \n  \nThe Court would like to clarify that during the deposition, plaintiff’s counsel will be able to question John Doe. No. 1 during \nthe deposition. However, as in a trial, the Court will also question the witness as necessary. \n  \nFinally, plaintiff argues that the deposition should not be limited to only the three areas outlined in the Court’s Order. \n  1 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nHowever, as discussed above, the Court feels that these are the areas which are the most significant and critical to the issues \ncurrently before the Court. Neither the Court nor the parties have the luxury of time to ask all the questions which in a normal \ncase they might propound to the witness. Keep in mind, this case was filed almost a year ago, on June 3, 2005. Had discovery \nbeen as aggressive initially as it has been in the last thirty days, more time could have been given to these issues. \n  \n*2 Accordingly, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider. (Doc. # 160). \n  \nAn anonymous deposition of John Doe No. 1 will take place on Monday June 5, 2006 at 1:00 p.m. in Kansas City, Missouri. \nJohn Doe No. 1 will be present at the Courthouse in Kansas City, Missouri. Each side will be permitted to have one attorney \npresent at the deposition. The plaintiff will be given two hours to question John Doe No. 1 on the three subject areas \npreviously discussed and covered within the list which was previously submitted to the Court by plaintiff. Counsel for the \nState will be given a reasonable time to question the witness, not to exceed that time allowed to plaintiff. Discovery has been \nextended to allow this deposition only. The deadline for the parties to submit their pre-trial briefs has been extended to \nThursday June 8, 2006. \n  \n \n \n  2 \n ",

Anders \n2010 South Big Bend Blvd.  Eric Berger \nSt. Louis, MO  63139  Jenner & Block LLP \n  601 13th Street N.W. \nWashington, DC  20005 \n \nCounsel for Plaintiff-Appellee \n \nJanuary 2, 2007   \n \n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE CASE AND REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT \nMissouri Department of Corrections (DOC) officials appeal Judge Gaitan’s \ndetermination  that  their  lethal-injection  procedures  pose  a  significant  and \nunreasonable  risk  that  Appellee  Michael  Taylor  will  suffer  an  excruciating \nexecution.  That ruling should be upheld.  The record shows that the DOC has \nabdicated authority over executions to an incompetent physician who has altered \ncritical elements of the procedure, including the amount of anesthetic given to \ninmates.  These arbitrary variations are so pervasive that DOC officials in this \nlitigation cannot describe accurately even the most basic aspects of its procedures. \nThe State’s appeal asks this Court to reweigh the evidence heard by Judge \nGaitan, and substitute its judgment in crafting a remedy.  No basis exists for doing \nso: the violation finding is amply supported by the record, and Judge Gaitan’s \nremedy is carefully tailored to fix the systemic problems in Missouri’s execution \nprocess  in  an  unobtrusive  manner.    The  DOC’s  proposed  remedy,  in  contrast, \nundertakes  no  meaningful  reforms  and  suggests  that  the  DOC  does  not  take \nseriously the grave flaws Judge Gaitan found.  The State also asks this Court to \nadopt an Eighth Amendment standard that would restrict execution methods only \nwhen they are both guaranteed and intended to cause pain.  That argument is \nwaived as well as refuted by governing precedent. \nThis Court has set oral argument for 30 minutes per side. \ni\n \n\n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nSUMMARY OF THE CASE AND REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT............i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES.....................................................................................v \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES...............................................................................1 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS........................................................................................2 \nI.

Wayne Farms, 411 F.3d 923 (8th Cir. 2005) \n \n1\n \n\n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nMichael  Taylor  filed  the  instant  action  on  June  3,  2005,  alleging  that \nMissouri’s execution procedure subjects him to a significant and unnecessary risk \nof excruciating pain, thereby violating the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and \nunusual punishment.  In January 2006, the district court rejected Taylor’s claims \non  the basis of  an extremely  limited record.    After this  Court, in  April  2006, \nremanded this case for supplementation of the record, Mr. Taylor presented new \ncompelling evidence of systemic failures plaguing the DOC’s execution process.  \nJudge  Gaitan then  reversed his  earlier decision  and  concluded that the  DOC’s \nprocedures subject condemned prisoners to cruel and unusual punishment. \nI.  PRE-REMAND PROCEEDINGS. \nAfter Taylor filed this action, he obtained limited discovery over the DOC’s \nobjections.  On January 3, 2006, six days after the court denied the DOC’s motion \nto dismiss, the State set his execution for February 1, 2006.  In late January 2006, \nthe district court held an emergency hearing on the merits. \nThe evidence presented at the January hearing was necessarily limited in \n1\nscope.     Virtually  all  Taylor  knew  about  the  procedure  at  the  time  was  that, \naccording to the testimony of DOC officials, the DOC accomplished executions by \nadministering 5 grams of thiopental, 60 milligrams of pancuronium bromide, and \n                                                 \n1\n That evidence is part of the record in this case.  DOC_App_I:148-54. \n2\n \n\n \n2\n240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride.   1/31/06_Tr_67-69.  These drugs are \nadministered through an IV inserted in the femoral vein, which is located deep \nbeneath the skin in the groin.  Responsibility for the execution procedure is vested \nin Doe 1 (“Doe”), a surgeon, and Doe 2, a licensed practical nurse, as well as Does \n3 and 5, nonmedical personnel.  Id. 66-67, 80. \nThe first drug administered is thiopental, an ultra-short acting barbiturate \nanesthetic.  1/30/06_Tr_11, 14.  If successfully administered in sufficient dose, \nthiopental  will  cause  deep  unconsciousness  and,  eventually,  death.  \n1/31/06_Tr_18-19,  32.  The  second  drug  administered,  pancuronium  bromide, \nmasks all visible suffering by paralyzing the inmate’s voluntary muscles, including \nthe diaphragm.  1/30/06_Tr_73; 1/31/06_Tr_22-23.  If injected into a conscious \nperson, pancuronium would cause the agonizing feeling of conscious paralysis and \nsuffocation.  1/30/06_Tr_27.  To observers, however, the person would appear \ntranquil.  1/30/06_Tr_73.  The last drug injected, potassium chloride, is the actual \nagent of execution, as it induces cardiac arrest.  1/31/06_Tr_23; 1/30/06_Tr_29.  It \nwas uncontested that when administered in concentrations sufficient to stop the \nheart,  potassium  is  extraordinarily  painful,  causing  an  excruciating  burning \nsensation in the veins and lungs.  1/30/06_Tr_29; 1/31/06_Tr_23. \n                                                 \n2\n That testimony turned out to be wrong, as discussed below. \n3\n \n\n \nBecause  both  pancuronium  and  potassium  cause  extreme  suffering  if \ninjected  into  a  conscious  individual,  the  induction  of  anesthesia  is  crucial  to \nensuring a humane execution.  If the injection of the intended dose of thiopental is \nnot completely successful, or does not result in deep anesthesia, the inmate will \nexperience conscious suffocation and excruciating pain.  1/31/06_Tr_58.  Without \ndiscovery into how the DOC actually accomplished executions, Taylor was unable \nto test whether the DOC’s actual practices ensured adequate anesthesia.  At the \nconclusion of the hearing, Judge Gaitan rejected Taylor’s claims on the ground that \nTaylor  had  not  established  that  inmates  were  at  risk  of  inadequate  anesthesia.  \nDOC_Add_6. \nThis Court, sitting en banc, subsequently stayed Taylor’s execution. After \nbriefing and argument, this Court concluded that Taylor “was unable to make the \nrecord he felt necessary for the full and fair consideration of the merits of his case” \nat the January hearing.  This Court therefore remanded the case to Judge Gaitan for \n“further discovery”  and  “a continuation of the hearing held on January 30-31, \n2006.”    DOC_App_I:154.    The  district  court  was  given  60  days  in  which  to \nreconvene the evidentiary hearing and issue an opinion “amending, modifying or \nrestating” its judgment on the merits. \n4\n \n\n \nII.  REMAND PROCEEDINGS. \nOn remand, Taylor uncovered and presented evidence that the DOC has \nconducted executions in an arbitrary, dangerous manner, creating a significant risk \nof excruciating pain.  Judge Gaitan’s findings to this effect were made on the basis \nof  a  limited  record,  as  he  severely —  and  erroneously,  in  Taylor’s  view — \nrestricted the scope of discovery on remand.  Even the limited discovery, however, \ndemonstrated the DOC’s institutional failure to take even the most basic steps to \nensure that executions were performed consistently and humanely. \nA.  The Discovery Allowed by the District Court. \nAfter  two  teleconferences  on  the  scope  and  timing  of  discovery,  Judge \nGaitan ordered that Taylor could receive only the following narrow discovery: \nexecution  records  from  the  previous  six  executions;  a  limited  deposition  of \nDirector Crawford; interrogatory responses from Crawford and Does 1 through 5; \nand an inspection of the DOC’s execution facility.  Taylor_App_31-33.  Judge \nGaitan repeatedly denied requests to depose Does 1 through 5, the members of the \n3\nexecution team, as well as other non-anonymous DOC employees.  \n                                                 \n3\n  The  district  court  also  denied  all  discovery  regarding  Doe’s  malpractice  and \nlicensing  history,  DOC_App_III:638,  despite  evidence  that  he  had  been \nreprimanded  by  a  medical  licensing  authority,  DOC_App_II:446.    It  is  now \napparent that the DOC opposed these efforts in the hopes of covering up extremely \ndamaging details regarding Doe’s background.  See DOC_App_II:447-48.  A July \nnewspaper  article  eventually  exposed  Doe’s  problems,  including  his  loss  of \nprivileges  at two  hospitals  and  a  public  reprimand  authorized  by  the  Missouri \n5\n \n\n \nThe  discovery  ordered  revealed  that  Doe,  the  doctor  who  oversees \nexecutions,  had  prepared  only  2.5  grams  of  thiopental  for  Taylor’s  scheduled \nexecution  and  for  the  execution  of  Marlin  Gray.    This  evidence  directly \ncontradicted the DOC’s representations to this Court and the district court that it \nalways administered a dose of 5 grams of thiopental — including representations, \nmade in court 24 hours before Taylor’s execution, that it would use 5 grams on \nTaylor.  1/31/06_Tr_67, 74-75; Taylor_App_20-30.  After Doe offered several \ncontradicting  written  explanations  for  lowering  the  thiopental  dose, \nDOC_App_II:442-43;  DOC_App_III:627, Judge Gaitan permitted Taylor to take, \nin the Court’s presence and under its supervision, a limited two-hour anonymous \ndeposition of Doe.  Taylor_App_37-38; Taylor_App_39-41.  No other discovery \nwas permitted. \nB.  Evidence Regarding the DOC’s Conduct of Executions. \nEven  this  truncated  discovery  revealed  that  the  DOC  has  treated  the \nexecution  procedure  with  callous  disregard,  abdicating  all  responsibility  to  the \nmanifestly incompetent Doe.  He has performed the most important aspects of the \nprocedure  in  a  dangerous,  unpredictable  manner.    This  evidence  shattered  the \nDOC’s previous representations regarding its procedures, and utterly belies the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAttorney  General’s  office.    See  Jeremy  Kohler,  Behind  the  Mask  of  the  Mo. \nExecution  Doctor,  St.  L.  Post-Dispatch,  July  29,  2006,  available  at \nhttp://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/srlinks.nsf/0/0903CBDA66BF5D2\n2862571BC007C4F67?OpenDocument (last visited December 20, 2006). \n6\n \n\n \nDOC’s description of a regularized and careful process in its brief to this Court, \nDOC_Br_18-21. \n1.  The DOC’s Abdication of Responsibility for the Execution \nProcedure. \nThe DOC vested complete responsibility for designing and overseeing the \nexecution procedure in Doe in the early 1990s, after “a very difficult execution … \nwhich  caused  a  flurry  in  the  press  and  embarrassment  to  the  prison.”  \nDOC_App_III:654.  The DOC did not provide Doe with any assistance, and in \ndesigning  the  current  procedure,  Doe  did  not  consult  with  anyone,  including \npersons knowledgeable about anesthesia.  DOC_App_III:654; DOC_App_III:657.  \nIt  was  Doe  who  decided  to  use  femoral  catheterization  in  all  executions; \ndetermined  drug  doses;  and  designed  the  drug  delivery  apparatus.  \nDOC_App_III:646-67, 650, 655, 717; DOC_App_IV:826.  The DOC acquiesced \nin all of these decisions without even discussing their merits with Doe.  Instead, \nDoe communicated his intentions through non-medical execution personnel, and \nthe DOC then implemented them.  DOC_App_III:717; DOC_App_III:698, 718. \nDoe also had unfettered discretion over how executions were carried out.  In \nevery  execution,  Doe  inserts  the  femoral  catheter;  mixes  the  thiopental  into \nsolution; prepares the syringes of thiopental and the other drugs; and oversees the \nactual  injection  of  the  drugs.  DOC_App_IV:812-14.  Though  Crawford  has \nultimate  responsibility  for  each  execution,  neither  he  nor  other  DOC  officials \n7\n \n\n \nobserves Doe’s conduct during executions, and Crawford testified that he simply \ndefers to Doe on execution nights.  DOC_App_IV:814; DOC_App_III:699, 740-\n41.  Indeed, because the DOC has no source of medical expertise other than Doe, \nthe DOC has no choice but to rely completely on Doe.  DOC_App_III:698-99.  As \nDoe summed up his role, the Director is “relying on me to keep him looking good, \nto use his terms directly.”  DOC_App_III:697. \n2.  Doe’s Arbitrary and Dangerous Conduct of Executions. \nBecause  the  DOC  allows  Doe  to  exercise  his  authority  over  Missouri \nexecutions in an arbitrary, unpredictable manner, crucial elements of the procedure \nhave varied from execution to execution.  According to Doe, the DOC’s primary \nobjective in performing executions is to ensure that death occurs quickly, and that \nno observable incident occurs that would cause witnesses to ask Crawford what \nhappened.  DOC_App_III:730 (“[The DOC doesn’t] want to wait 25 minutes with \nwitnesses standing around wondering what happened.”); DOC_App_III:656.  Doe \ntherefore believed, and the DOC never gave him reason to doubt, that he could \nalter  any  aspect  of  the  execution  process,  even  to  make  the  procedure  more \ndangerous,  so  long  as  the  alteration  was  undetectable  to  witnesses.  \nDOC_App_III:658, 664, 739-40. \n8\n \n\n \na.  Administration of Varying Doses of Thiopental. \nMost crucially, Doe has varied the dose of thiopental from execution to \nexecution, and there is no way of determining how much thiopental was actually \nadministered in any execution.  Contrary to the DOC’s in-court representations, its \nexecution records, read in conjunction with Doe’s testimony, reveal that in five of \nthe past six executions, Doe prepared substantially less than 5 grams of thiopental.  \nDOC_App_V:1111-12; DOC_App_III:644-49.  Because Doe has always operated \nwithout oversight, he assumed that changing the thiopental dose was within his \nauthority, and he never informed the DOC.  DOC_App_III:626. \nDoe testified that at previous executions, he intended to administer less than \n5 grams of thiopental.  DOC_App_III:646.  Although the DOC’s records indicate \nthat he could have prepared thiopental doses ranging between 2.5 and 4 grams, \nDoe  admitted  that  may  have  actually  mixed  substantially  less  than  that  for \ninjection  at  each  execution.    DOC_App_III:649  (“[W]e  have  no  provision  for \nshowing that we disposed of three [grams] and gave two, or disposed of two and \ngave  three,  because  this  [record]  has  not  been  set  up  that  way.”); \nDOC_App_III:651-52.  Doe found thiopental to be a “difficult drug” to prepare, \nDOC_App_III:656, and decided to use a lower dose after he had difficulty fully \ndissolving 5 grams, DOC_App_III:649.  When pressed about the precise doses he \nprepared,  Doe  refused  to  estimate,  and  stated  he  that  did  not  recall. \n9\n \n\n \nDOC_App_III:649-51.    Doe  also  admitted  that  he  was  dyslexic  and  had \nconsiderable  trouble  making  calculations  and  keeping  track  of  numbers.  \nDOC_App_III:659-60,  663.  In  sum,  there  is  no  way  of  knowing  how  much \nthiopental Doe prepared for any particular execution, and no guarantee that he \n \nalways — or ever — prepared a minimally adequate  dose. \nWhen  Doe  first  encountered  problems  mixing  the  thiopental,  he  did  not \nbring  the  issue  to  the  DOC’s  attention,  apparently  because  he  felt  pressure  to \nensure that each execution went forward: \nI go to the execution chamber and we’re on a time frame.  I have minutes to \nget the drugs ready, minutes to ensure a perfect IV.  There’s no time to call \nthe drug company at midnight,  the Director or nursing staff to change.  I am \nrequired to deal with what I am given and make it come out right and make \nthis — make it happen I guess is best way to say it …. I was able to modify \nwhat I was given and [the Director] was totally unaware that there was any \nchange in dosage. \nDOC_App_III:664.  Doe also did not investigate why the thiopental purchased by \nthe DOC was not soluble, or request new thiopental, even though the manufacturer \nwarns against using insoluble thiopental, DOC_App_V:1251.  DOC_App_III:680. \nIn  any  event,  Doe  believed  that  the  precise  dose  of  thiopental  used  in \nexecutions  was  unimportant  for  two  reasons.    First,  Doe  stated  that  because \nlowering  the  dose  of  thiopental  did  not  make  a  “visible  difference”  in  the \nappearance or length of the execution, the “total dose [of thiopental] to me was \ninsignificant.”    DOC_App_III:658.    Of  course,  the  paralytic  effect  of  the \n10\n \n\n \npancuronium  would  ensure  that  witnesses  would  be  unable  to  tell  even  if  no \nthiopental were administered, because the execution would still appear peaceful.  \nDoe noted as much, stating that his goal in performing executions was to perform \nthem “with no apparent suffering that the public can observe, which they will make \nthe most of.”  DOC_App_III:658.   \nSecond,  Doe  felt  that  it  was  not  necessary  to  induce  general  anesthesia \nduring executions.  DOC_App_III:692, 710.  He believed that even an overdose of \nthiopental would be insufficient to guard against extreme pain, DOC_App_III:689-\n90, but that this did not matter in an execution because he injected the potassium \n4\nwithin inches of the heart, DOC_App_III:696,  and in any event inmates would be \nparalyzed, DOC_App_III:692. \nDespite  Doe’s  conviction  that  he  had  acted  properly  in  reducing  the \nthiopental  dose  without  notifying  the  DOC,  Doe  initially  denied  that  he  had \nreduced the dose, and the DOC conveyed that denial to the court.  Taylor_App_34-\n36;  DOC_App_V:1325-26.    After  Doe  recanted,  his  explanation  for  doing  so \nevolved in response to Taylor’s and the Court’s inquiries.  At first, Doe stated that \nhe changed the dose “because … other jurisdictions considered a dose of … 5 \ngrams to be larger than necessary.”  DOC_App_437.  Later, Doe stated that he had \nreduced  the  dose  because  of  difficulty  dissolving  the  thiopental.  \n                                                 \n4\n This assertion is demonstrably incorrect given the equipment used.  June_Tr_61. \n11\n \n\n \nDOC_App_III:627.  Finally, in his testimony, Doe admitted for the first time that \nhe had lowered the dose of thiopental in at least five of the six executions for which \nTaylor received discovery, and that he did not know how much he had given.  \nDOC_App_III:646. \nIn sum, there is no way to know how much thiopental was prepared in any \nexecution.  Doe’s understanding of the DOC’s overriding objective of avoiding \nscrutiny, his inability to recall the doses, dyslexia, misapprehension about the need \nfor  anesthesia  in  executions,  and  misrepresentations  to  the  district  court,  raise \nserious questions as to whether he ever prepared an adequate dose of anesthetic.  \nAnd  because  all  inmates  were  given  pancuronium  and  no  autopsies  were \nperformed, there was no way to discern at the time, and no means of reconstructing \nnow, whether these inmates were adequately anesthetized. \nb.  Doe’s Dangerous and Erratic Methods of Obtaining \nIV Access. \nDoe  testified  that  he  uses  a  highly  invasive  form  of  IV  access,  femoral \ncatheterization,  rather  than  placing  the  standard  peripheral  IV  in  the  elbow, \nbecause  it  “allow[s]  rapid  infusion  of  the  drugs  by  nonmedical  people,” \nDOC_App_III:719, thereby facilitating quick executions.  But because the femoral \nvein is buried deep within the upper thigh, femoral catheterization is much riskier \nthan  peripheral  access,  and  accordingly  is  not  the  first-choice  method  of \ncatheterization in any other state.  June_Tr_109.  Indeed, it is undisputed that a \n12\n \n\n \nnumber of extremely painful and life-threatening complications can immediately \nresult from femoral catheterization.  1/30/06_Tr_63; June_Tr_141-42.  The DOC \nacquiesced in Doe’s decision to use femoral access, apparently without considering \nwhether  the  procedure  increased  medical  risks.    DOC_App_III:716-18; \nJune_Tr_354-55. \nDoe  botched  the  femoral  catheterization  in  at  least  one  of  the  last  six \n5\nexecutions.   Photographs  revealed  that  Timothy  Johnston,  prior  to  his  death, \nexperienced significant bleeding and a hematoma, a painful and potentially severe \ncondition that can arise when the femoral artery is pierced or lacerated.  Compare \nTaylor_App_64-65  (Johnston:  hematoma)  with  Taylor_App_66  (Smith:  no \napparent complications).  As blood pools beneath the skin, it exerts pressure on the \nsurrounding nerves and tissue, causing potentially severe pain.  June_Tr_47, 50, \n157.  Doe, however, refused to acknowledge that this complication had arisen, in \npart because he believes (incorrectly) that such complications are impossible when \nhe performs the procedure.  DOC_App_III:712, 724.  When asked what he would \ndo if an inmate experienced severe bleeding and a hematoma during attempted \ncatheterization,  Doe  replied  that  he  would  not  treat  it:  “He’s  got  two  legs.”  \nDOC_App_III:713-14. \n                                                 \n5\n Because Taylor was denied discovery into the additional executions in which Doe \ninserted  a  femoral  catheter  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the  true  rate  of \ncomplications caused by Doe. \n13\n \n\n \nDoe also revealed that in one execution, he had inserted the catheter in the \nsubclavian vein, a procedure that involves a distinct set of potential immediate and \nagonizing complications, including suffocating as one’s chest fills up with air and \nblood.  DOC_App_III:740; June_Tr_54-55.  Doe admitted that he performed the \nprocedure  even  though  he  knew  that  to  do  so  safely  would  require  additional \nequipment that the DOC did not have, as well as “significant modification of the \nfacility.”  DOC_App_III:735.  In other words, Doe concededly chose to place an \n6\ninmate in danger of an agonizing death.  \n3.  Other Members of the Execution Team \nAlthough Taylor received virtually no discovery into the other execution \nteam  members,  it  is  apparent  that  they  have  little  or  no  medical  training  and \noperate  at  the  direction  of  Doe.    Doe  2  is  a  licensed  practical  nurse  (LPN).  \n1/31/06_Tr_67.  Under Missouri law, LPNs are non-professionals with minimal \nmedical training who must work under the direct supervision of a physician or \nregistered nurse.  Mo. Ann. Stat. § 335.016(7), (9).  All that is known about Doe \n2’s conduct is that despite his responsibility for helping Doe prepare the thiopental, \nDOC_App_IV:812,  he  did  not  realize  that  Doe  prepared  lower  doses, \nDOC_App_II:465. \n                                                 \n6\n Because this incident did not occur within the last six executions, Taylor does not \nknow whether any complications occurred. \n14\n \n\n \nDoes  3  and  5,  who  inject  the  drugs  during  executions  by  alternating \nsyringes,  have  no  medical  training.    DOC_App_IV:814;  DOC_App_III:666.  \nBecause  only  Doe  has  significant  medical  training,  he  mixes  the  thiopental \n“because it’s very difficult for someone who is not used to this to accomplish it,” \nDOC_App_III:665,  and  he  also  directs  the  others’  actions,  DOC_App_III:667 \n(“That’s the first time probably in their life they [Does 3 and 5] have picked up a \nsyringe, and it’s a Luralock twist connector and then they have a separate clamp \nwhere they have to clamp and unclamp the tubing, so it’s a little stressful for them \nto be doing this.”). \nC.  The Continuation of the Evidentiary Hearing. \nIn  June  2006,  Judge  Gaitan  reconvened  the  evidentiary  hearing,  which \nfocused on medical-expert testimony as to whether the DOC’s execution practices \nsubject  inmates  to  an  unreasonable  risk  that  they  will  not  be  successfully \nanesthetized. \n1.  Taylor’s Case. \nTaylor’s  expert  testimony  established  that  the  DOC’s  careless  and \ninconsistent execution procedures unreasonably fail to ensure adequate anesthesia, \nthereby subjecting inmates to a significant and needless risk of excruciating pain.  \nMissouri’s  practices  fail  to  ensure:    reliable,  consistent  preparation  of  the  full \nintended dose of non-defective thiopental; successful delivery of that thiopental \n15\n \n\n \nthrough  patent  IV  tubing  and  a  properly  placed  catheter  into  the  inmate’s \ncirculation; and sufficient anesthesia prior to the injection of the pancuronium and \npotassium and throughout the execution. \nDr. Mark Heath, an anesthesiologist and expert in lethal-injection procedures \nnationwide,  testified  that  inmates  faced  a  substantial  danger  of  inadequate \nanesthesia as a result of the DOC’s abdication of responsibility to Doe and its \nfailure  to  maintain  a  written  protocol.    June_Tr_17-19,  64-65,  82.    Dr.  Heath \ntestified that Doe is “completely lacking in the credentials and qualifications and \nknowledge, skill set and experience to be entrusted with the delivery of general \nanesthesia, especially in an incredibly important thing like an execution.”  Id. 83; \nid. 21, 65.  Dr. Heath’s opinion was based on Doe’s numerous factually incorrect \nstatements about femoral catheterization, potassium, thiopental, and anesthesia in \ngeneral.  Id. 27-33, 39, 44, 59-64.  In addition, Doe’s dyslexia leaves him unable to \ndeliver anesthesia because he cannot reliably calculate dosages, or keep track of \nhow much thiopental he has mixed.  Id. 34, 42. \nDoe’s  lack  of  anesthesia  training  and  incompetence  directly  increase \ninmates’  risk  of  excruciating  death  because  Doe  prepares  the  thiopental  in  a \nmanner  that  is  “very  sloppy  and  …  reflects  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the \nimportance of the quantity of drugs that are being given,” id. 24-25; id. 21.  Neither \nDr. Heath nor Dr. Thomas Henthorn, Taylor’s other expert anesthesiologist, could \n16\n \n\n \ndiscern from Doe’s testimony how much thiopental he had administered in any \nexecution, and both believed, based on the process that Doe described, that it may \nhave been considerably less than 2.5 grams.  Id. 23, 219, 222.  In addition, the fact \nthat Doe had trouble dissolving the thiopental suggested that the drug may have \nbeen defective and therefore devoid of anesthetic properties.  Id. 36-38.  Thus, \nseveral  inmates  may  have  been  given  defective  thiopental  and  remained  fully \nconscious during their executions.  Id. \nMoreover,  Dr.  Heath,  Dr.  Henthorn,  and  Dr.  Stephen  Johnson,  an \ninterventional  radiologist  who  has  performed  thousands  of  femoral \ncatheterizations, all concluded that Doe had demonstrated extremely poor medical \njudgment in numerous respects that each increased the likelihood of severe pain.  \nThese included deviating from standard medical practices in mixing the thiopental, \nid. 42; administering insoluble thiopental, id. 40-41; failing to record the doses of \nthiopental administered, id. 24-25; inserting a subclavian line without the proper \nequipment,  id.  54-57;  opting  to  use  the  more  invasive,  dangerous  femoral \ncatheterization even though it was medically unnecessary, id. 84-85, 144, 161, \n228-29; and planning to treat a hematoma by letting it bleed out, a medically \nunaccepted and needlessly painful approach, id. 157-58.  In sum, Taylor’s three \nmedical experts all concluded that Doe’s behavior places inmates in significant \ndanger of suffering excruciating pain.  Id. 65, 161-68, 224.  \n17\n \n\n \nEven if Doe were to prepare an adequate dose of non-defective thiopental, \nthe manner in which the drugs are injected creates the risk that the full dose will \nnot successfully be delivered.  Id. 82.  Doe may be unable to insert the femoral \ncatheter properly because he performs the procedure only during executions.  Id. \n50, 53.  Similarly, the catheter’s efficacy could be hindered by a complication such \nas a hematoma like the one suffered by Timothy Johnston, id. 157, resulting in an \ninfiltration that prevents an adequate dose of thiopental from reaching the vein, id. \n7\n196.   The fact that nonmedical personnel inject the drugs in the dark while holding \nflashlights,  increases  the  risk  of  injecting  the  drugs  in  the  wrong  order  or \nmanipulating  the  syringes  improperly,  resulting  in  infiltration  or  tubing \ndisconnection.  Id. 81-82. \nMoreover, the drug delivery apparatus is needlessly contorted, increasing the \nlikelihood of IV failures and vitiating the team’s ability to detect those failures.  Id. \n68, 196.  The use of 8 to 9 feet of IV tubing, without an IV bag, compounds the \nlikelihood of IV tubing problems, such as leaks and kinking.  Id. 77-78.  The \ninmate is alone in the execution chamber and the execution team has only an \nobstructed view, through partially closed blinds and one-way glass, of the top of \nthe inmate’s head.  Id. 72-76.  The team cannot observe any signs of IV problems \nor  distress  from  this  vantage  point,  because  a  sheet  covers  the  IV  tubing,  the \n                                                 \n7\n Infiltration occurs when the catheter is not fully within the vein, so that some of \nthe drugs go into the surrounding tissue instead of into the vein.

Thus, if any IV problems prevented the full \n8\nadministration  of  the  thiopental,   the  team  would  not  detect  it,  and  the \npancuronium  would  then  prevent  the  inmate  from  indicating  that  he  was  still \nconscious. \nDr. Henthorn, one of the country’s foremost experts on thiopental, testified \nthat even if the full intended dose of thiopental were successfully administered, \nsome inmates likely were not deeply anesthetized during their executions, because \nhis  analysis  of  the  onset  of  drug  effect  demonstrated  that  the  potassium  was \ninjected before the thiopental fully anesthetized them.  Id. 199-222. \nBoth Dr. Heath and Dr. Henthorn testified that the only way to reasonably \nensure that inmates were adequately anesthetized prior to the administration of \n                                                 \n8\n In this Court, the DOC attempts to assert a new theory, not presented at trial, that \nif IV problems prevent the inmate from receiving an adequate dose of thiopental, \nthe other drugs necessarily will not reach the inmate either.  DOC_Br_58.  This is \nincorrect.  An infiltration, leak, or other IV problem could result in, for instance, \nonly 40% of each of the drugs reaching the inmate’s circulation.  The inmate \nwould then receive a dose of thiopental insufficient to cause deep unconsciousness, \nbut sufficient pancuronium and potassium to cause paralysis and excruciating pain \n(and death), respectively.  That infiltration can cause an inhumane execution is \ndefinitively  demonstrated  by  the  recent  Florida  execution  of  Angel  Diaz,  who \nmoved  about,  grimacing  in  pain,  for  24  minutes  following  the  injection  of \nthiopental.  Mr. Diaz’s IVs were infiltrated, resulting in extensive chemical burns \nand requiring additional doses of the drugs.  See Ron Word, Official Says Florida \nExecution  was  Botched,  Yahoo!  News,  Dec.  15,  2006,  available  at \nhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061215/ ap_on_re_us/florida_execution (last visited \nDec. 18, 2006). \n19\n \n\n \npancuronium  and  potassium  was  to  have  a  trained  person  assess  the  inmates’ \nanesthetic depth.  Id. 70-71, 107-09, 196.  This was particularly necessary in light \nof the problems plaguing the execution process, and the numerous points at which \nmistakes or irregularities committed by Doe or other team members could result in \nthe failure to deliver adequate anesthetic.  Id. \n2.  The DOC’s Case. \na.  Expert Testimony. \nDr. Mark Dershwitz, an anesthesiologist, testified that although Doe had \n“made some pharmacological mistakes,” as long as he managed to prepare 1.5 to 2 \ngrams of thiopental, the dose would be adequate.  June_Tr_335.  Dr. Dershwitz \nspeculated that Doe might have had trouble dissolving the thiopental because he \nwas attempting to use too high a concentration, although he conceded he could not \nbe certain.  Id. 339. \nWith respect to the need to monitor anesthetic depth, Dr. Dershwitz opined \nthat assuming that five grams of thiopental were “properly administered into a \nworking intravenous catheter,” and the thiopental actually reached the inmate’s \ncirculation, there would be no need to monitor anesthetic depth because all persons \ngiven  five  grams  would  be  deeply  unconscious.    Id.  284.    He  also  described \noccasions where medical exigencies force anesthesiologists to induce anesthesia \nwithout monitoring anesthetic depth.  Id. 269-70.  When asked what “justifies \n20\n \n\n \ntaking  the  increased  risk  of  not  monitoring  anesthetic  depth”  in  an  execution \nsetting, Dr. Dershwitz responded, “That’s not for me to decide.”  Id. 313. \nb.  Testimony of DOC Officials. \nBoth Director Crawford and Terry Moore, the Director of Adult Institutions, \ntestified that they were disappointed that Doe had changed the dose of thiopental \nwithout their knowledge.  Crawford testified that the DOC would “firm … up” the \nprocedure by specifying in writing the doses of each chemical (including a 5-gram \ndose  of  thiopental).    The  actual  procedure —  the  personnel,  drug  preparation, \nadministration, and method of IV access — would remain exactly the same, and \nwould not be committed to writing.  Both Crawford and Moore reaffirmed their \nconfidence in Doe, and indicated their intent to retain him  as the head of the \nexecution team.  Id. 377 (“I have known [Doe] to be bright, professional …”); id. \n357.  Crawford saw no need to consult with any  medical personnel about the \nprotocol,  moreover,  because  he  believed  that  executions  are  not  “medical \nprocedure[s]  that  require[]  somebody  to  undergo  anesthesia  or  to  be  rendered \nunconscious,”  and  in  any  event,  the  DOC  is  not  equipped  to  do  procedures \nrequiring anesthesia.  Id. 381. \nD.  The District Court’s Decision. \nOn June 26, Judge Gaitan ruled that Missouri’s execution procedure created \nan  unnecessary  risk  of  inflicting  extreme  pain  and  suffering  on  inmates,  and \n21\n \n\n \ntherefore  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment.    The  court  found  that  there  were \n“numerous  problems”  plaguing  the  execution  procedure,  and  these  problems \nforeseeably placed inmates in danger of excruciating pain.  DOC_Add_20-22. \nIn order to remedy the Eighth Amendment violation, Judge Gaitan ordered \nthe State to adopt certain changes to its lethal-injection procedures.  In principal \npart, the court ordered the State to promulgate a written execution protocol in \nconsultation  with  an  anesthesiologist;  retain  an  anesthesiologist  who  would \nmonitor anesthetic depth during executions, prepare the drugs, and determine the \nmethod of IV access; and develop a contingency plan and an auditing process.  The \nDOC was to submit its new protocol to the court by July 15, 2006. \nIII.  REMEDIAL PROCEEDINGS. \nOn  July  14,  2006,  the  DOC  submitted  its  proposed  protocol,  which  it \nconcedes does not comply with Judge Gaitan’s June 26th order.  Most importantly, \nthe protocol does not provide for any effective monitoring of anesthetic depth and \nretains the same personnel, including Doe.  Taylor opposed the proposed protocol \nbecause  it  did  not  meaningfully  address  the  numerous  problems  afflicting  the \nexisting system. \nOn September 12, 2006, Judge Gaitan issued an order rejecting the proposed \nprotocol  in  relevant  part,  on  the  ground  that  it  did  not  remedy  the  Eighth \nAmendment  violation  because  it  did  not  provide  for  effective  monitoring  of \n22\n \n\n \nanesthetic depth.  DOC_Add_27.  The Court modified its previous order to allow \nthe State to retain either an anesthesiologist or a physician with sufficient training \nin the administration of anesthesia to perform the monitoring function and oversee \nexecutions.   Recognizing that the DOC planned to continue using Doe, the court \nalso  barred  his  participation  in  future  executions.    DOC_Add_27.    Shortly \nthereafter, the DOC moved for reconsideration.  Judge Gaitan denied the motion, \nnoting  that  the  State  had indicated its  “lack  of  willingness  to  even  attempt  to \ncomply with the Court’s order.”  DOC_Add_31.  The DOC appealed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTaylor established at trial that the execution procedures employed by the \nDOC  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment  by  creating  an  unreasonable  risk  of  an \nexcruciating  execution.    Judge  Gaitan  found  that  the  DOC  has  abdicated  its \nresponsibility for the execution procedure to an incompetent physician who does \nnot understand the chemicals used and who has arbitrarily varied crucial elements \nof the procedure.  As the court concluded, the DOC’s institutional failures are so \nextensive that it has been unable accurately to represent the nature of the procedure \nor even discern how much anesthetic it administers.  Accordingly, Judge Gaitan \nimposed  reasonable  remedial  measures,  ordering  the  DOC  to  use  a  physician \ntrained in anesthesia to monitor anesthetic depth. \n23\n \n\n \nJudge Gaitan’s conclusions and injunction are in step with growing judicial \nand  executive  concerns  over  the  implementation  of  lethal  injection.    In  mid-\nDecember, following a bench trial that revealed evidence of incompetence and \ndisregard similar to that demonstrated by Taylor, the district court in Morales v. \nTilton concluded that California’s lethal-injection procedures violated the Eighth \nAmendment.  No. 06-219, __F.Supp.2d__, 2006 WL 3699493, at *8 (N.D.Cal. \nDec. 15, 2006) (“Morales III”).  Similarly, in Florida, a badly botched execution \nprompted  Governor  Bush  to  declare  a  moratorium  pending  investigation  by  a \ncommission composed of medical and other experts.  Fla. Exec. Order No. 06-260 \n9\n(Dec. 15, 2006) (Taylor_Add_1-4).  \nDespite this increasing recognition that lethal injection, if not implemented \nin a careful, professional manner, can be as torturous as barbaric methods long ago \nabandoned, as well as the overwhelming evidence that the DOC’s procedures are \nsystemically flawed, the DOC has continued to insist that a few cosmetic changes \nto its procedures can remedy the deficiencies.  As the Morales III Court noted \nwhen faced with similar obduracy, however, the DOC’s “unwillingness to see the \nsituation for what it is and be proactive is self-defeating.”  2006 WL 3699493, at \n*10 n.13.  Judge Gaitan’s conclusions are supported by extensive evidence, and his \nremedy provides a sensible, minimally intrusive solution to fundamental problems.  \n                                                 \n9\n Both California and Florida use the same three-drug sequence as Missouri. \n24\n \n\n \nThus, as in Morales, the DOC’s interests would be better served by complying \nwith the injunction than by its present intransigence.  Id. *8-*9. \nNevertheless,  the  DOC  now  challenges  Judge  Gaitan’s  ruling  on  three \ngrounds.    Mischaracterizing  the  record  and  ignoring  the  deferential  clear-error \nstandard of review that applies to all of Judge Gaitan’s findings, the DOC asserts \nthat  Judge  Gaitan  erred  in  finding  that  the  DOC’s  procedures  created  an \nunreasonable  risk  of  excruciating  pain.    The  DOC’s  contentions  are  meritless.  \nJudge Gaitan’s findings are amply supported by his evaluation of extensive fact- \nand expert-witness testimony.  \nThe DOC next contends that Judge Gaitan abused his discretion in ordering \nthe DOC to recruit a physician qualified to monitor inmates’ anesthetic depth.  Far \nfrom being an abuse of discretion, however, the court’s remedy is the best solution \nto the DOC’s systemic inability to ensure that inmates are adequately anesthetized: \nBy  monitoring  anesthetic  depth,  the  physician  can  prevent  the  procedures’ \nnumerous problems from resulting in excruciating pain.  Nor was Judge Gaitan’s \nrefusal to approve the DOC’s manifestly unacceptable proposed protocol — which \ndoes not provide for monitoring of anesthetic depth, retains Doe, and continues the \nnumerous flaws in the existing procedure — an abuse of discretion. \nFinally,  the  DOC  argues,  for  the  first  time  on  appeal,  that  the  Eighth \nAmendment is violated only upon a showing that an execution procedure is certain \n25\n \n\n \nto inflict pain on every inmate, and only where prison officials intend to cause \npain.  These arguments were not presented to the district court and are therefore \nwaived.    And  even  if  they  were  properly  presented  here,  the  State’s  novel \npropositions are also refuted by Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and common \nsense.    The  standard  applied  by  Judge  Gaitan,  that  the  Eighth  Amendment \nprohibits execution procedures that create a significant and unreasonable risk of \nunconstitutional pain, regardless of intent, is supported by the case law.  Under the \nDOC’s standard, the theoretical possibility that a needlessly dangerous execution \nprocedure  could  be  carried  out  without  causing  pain  would  exempt  it  from \nconstitutional review, no matter how many executions were actually painful.  For \nall these reasons, Taylor respectfully requests this Court to affirm Judge Gaitan’s \nrulings. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY FOUND THAT MISSOURI’S \nEXECUTION PROCEDURES VIOLATE THE EIGHTH \nAMENDMENT. \nJudge Gaitan’s conclusion that the DOC’s execution procedures create a \nsignificant  and  unreasonable  risk  of  excruciating  pain  is  compelled  by \noverwhelming evidence in the record.  The district court applied the correct legal \nstandard  —  that  execution  procedures  involving  an  unreasonable  risk  of \n26\n \n\n \n10\nexcruciating pain  are  unconstitutional,   DOC_Add_26,  DOC_Add_22 —  to  its \nfactfindings  that  the  DOC’s  procedures  are  systemically  flawed  and  create  a \nsubstantial risk of excruciating pain.   \nIn arguing that the court erred in finding a constitutional violation, the DOC \npervasively  mischaracterizes  Judge  Gaitan’s  factual  findings.    In  actuality,  the \ncourt  resoundingly  rejected  both  the  DOC’s  factual  assertions  and  its  expert \ntestimony regarding the risk of excruciating pain.  Judge Gaitan’s findings, which \ncan be overturned only if clearly erroneous, are based on his evaluation of the \ncredibility  and  demeanor  of  Doe,  Crawford,  and  Moore;  his  review  of  the \nvideotaped  inspection  of  the  execution  chamber  and  other  evidence;  and  his \nassessment of expert medical testimony regarding the risks created by the DOC’s \nfailures.  \nA.  Standard of Review. \nThis Court reviews the district court’s factfindings after a bench trial for \nclear error, and its conclusions of law de novo.  Robinson v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co., \n447 F.3d 1096, 1101 (8th Cir. 2006).  Under the clear error standard, this Court \nmust affirm if the district court’s findings are “plausible,” and may reverse only if \nafter reviewing the record it “is left with the definite and firm conviction that a \n                                                 \n10\n Perhaps realizing that it cannot prevail against the weight of the evidence, the \nDOC argues, for the first time on appeal, that Judge Gaitan applied an incorrect \nEighth Amendment standard.  This argument is both waived and incorrect.  See \ninfra Part III. \n27\n \n\n \nmistake has been committed.”  Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-76 \n(1985) (quotation marks omitted).  The district court’s evaluation of witnesses’ \ndemeanor  and  credibility  is  entitled  to  great  deference.    United  States  v. \nHernandez, 281 F.3d 746, 748 (8th Cir. 2002); Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. Swift-\nEckrich,  Inc.,  126  S.  Ct.  980,  986  n.3  (2006)  (appellate  courts  should  “be \nconstantly alert to the trial judge’s first-hand knowledge of witnesses, testimony, \nand issues”). \nThe  DOC  attempts  to  obscure  the  application  of  clear-error  review  by \nmischaracterizing  Judge  Gaitan’s  review  of  the  evidence  as  entirely  a  “legal” \ninquiry.  DOC_Br_39-40.  That effort fails.  The court’s findings of the “numerous \nproblems” plaguing the execution procedure, DOC_Add_20, are plainly findings \nof fact, as is the court’s finding that these problems create a significant risk of \ninadequate anesthesia.  See Morales v. Hickman, 438 F.3d 926, 929 & n.6 (9th Cir. \n2006), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006) (“Morales II”).  The Court’s ultimate \ncharacterization of the risk as unreasonable and unconstitutional, DOC_Add_22, \n26, is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review.  See Fierro v. \nGomez, 77 F.3d 301, 306 (9th Cir. 1996), vacated as moot on other grounds, 519 \nU.S. 918 (1996). \n \n \n28\n \n\n \nB.  The District Court’s Factual Findings Were Not Clearly \nErroneous. \nJudge Gaitan correctly held that the DOC’s execution procedure violates the \nEighth Amendment on the basis of the following factfindings, all of which have \nample support in the record and none of which is clearly erroneous. \n1.  Potassium Causes Excruciating Pain. \nRelying on the January testimony of both Taylor’s experts and the DOC’s \nexpert, Dr. Dershwitz, Judge Gaitan correctly found that potassium “will cause \nexcruciating pain as it is administered through the inmate’s veins.” DOC_Add_15; \n1/30/06_Tr_29, 56 (Dershwitz: potassium would be “extremely painful” “between \nthe time it’s injected and the time the heart stops”); 1/31/06_Tr_23; June_Tr_58, \n190.  The DOC apparently takes issue with the Court’s finding, DOC_Br_57 n.13, \npointing to Dershwitz’s June testimony that potassium might not be very painful.  \nJune_Tr_288-90.    Judge  Gaitan’s  decision  to  credit  Taylor’s  experts  and \nDershwitz’s January testimony is entitled to great deference, however, see In re \nCentral  Arkansas  Broadcasting  Co.,  68  F.3d  213,  215  (8th  Cir.  1995),  and  is \nbuttressed by Dershwitz’s inability to support his change in testimony with any \nscientific evidence, June_Tr_322-24.  See Cooey v. Taft, 430 F.Supp.2d 702 (S.D. \nOhio 2006) (noting growing evidence calling many of Dershwitz’s assertions “into \nquestion”). \n29\n \n\n \nJudge  Gaitan  also  correctly  found,  on  the  basis  of  unanimous  medical \ntestimony, that pancuronium would paralyze the inmate, rendering him unable “to \nshow that he was experiencing discomfort [from the potassium].”  DOC_Add_15. \n2.  The DOC’s Procedures are Fraught with Systemic \nProblems. \nHaving  found  that  conscious  inmates  would  be  subjected  to  “torturous” \nsuffering, DOC_App_II:354, the court correctly identified the key factual issue in \nthe case as whether the DOC’s procedures reliably ensure that general anesthesia is \n11\nsuccessfully induced.   DOC_Add_15, 20; see Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d \n1064, 1074 (9th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1096 (2005); Morales III, 2006 \nWL 3699493, at *5.  The evidence unequivocally demonstrates, and Judge Gaitan \ncorrectly found, that the execution procedures are systemically flawed, rendering \nthe DOC incapable of ensuring adequate anesthesia. \na.  The DOC Has Abdicated Authority to Doe. \nJudge Gaitan first found that the DOC had delegated “total discretion for the \nexecution  protocol”  to  Doe,  and  that  there  “are  no  checks  and  balances  or \noversight.”  DOC_Add_20-21.  The DOC contends that these findings are clearly \nerroneous because Crawford testified at trial that he had “the authority to set the \n                                                 \n11\n Thus, the DOC’s repeated assertion, see DOC_Br_49-50; 55-57, that a 5-gram \ndose of thiopental is more than sufficient to cause unconsciousness — which is \nundisputed  — simply begs the question whether the DOC can ensure that the 5-\ngram dose (or some adequate dose) is actually prepared correctly, administered \nsuccessfully into the inmate’s circulation, and given time to take effect.   \n30\n \n\n \nmethod  of  execution.”  DOC_Br_43;  June_Tr_363.    The  record  demonstrated, \nhowever, that Crawford’s authority is merely nominal: he, like previous directors, \nhas rubber-stamped Doe’s conduct of executions, unfailingly deferring to Doe’s \ndecisions regarding fundamental elements of the procedure.  DOC_Add_18-21; \nDOC_App_III:717-19.  Indeed, by the DOC’s own admission, it has always been \n“dependent” on Doe as the only authority on the procedure.  June_Tr_342 (Moore); \nid. 367-68 (Crawford); DOC_Add_20-21; DOC_App_III:697-99.  Moreover, Doe \nclearly  operated  with  no  meaningful  supervision,  as  he  repeatedly  altered  the \nprocedure without the DOC’s approval.  DOC_Add_20. \nThe DOC also asserts that it established that Doe would not have unbridled \nauthority in the future because Crawford testified that he would clarify that only he \nhad the authority to approve changes to the procedure.  DOC_Br_43.  Crawford \nand Moore also testified, however, that they intended to continue to defer to Doe’s \njudgment and that they had “confidence” in his “capabilities.”  DOC_Add_19; \nJune_Tr_387-89 (Crawford); id. 353, 356, 360 (Moore); DOC_App_III:731-32. \nMoreover,  the  DOC  did  not  present  any  evidence  that  it  intended  to \nmeaningfully limit Doe’s total control over the procedure on execution nights.  See \nDOC_Add_20; June_Tr_351-53, 381-82.  Indeed, DOC officials conceded that, \nwith no medical background of their own, they would not be able to assess Doe’s \nexercise  of  medical  judgment  with  respect  to  drug  preparation  or  any  other \n31\n \n\n \nexecution-night  decision.    See  DOC_Add_20;  June_Tr_346-47,  351-53.    Thus, \nDoe would continue to control the procedure in the only way that matters here: his \ndecisions and errors would determine whether or not executions were performed \nhumanely.  Judge Gaitan’s findings to this effect are overwhelmingly supported in \nthe record as a whole. \nb.  Doe Is Not Competent to Oversee or Perform the \nProcedure. \nJudge Gaitan next found that Doe, whose deposition testimony the court \nheard  first-hand,  is  not  capable  of  ensuring  that  inmates  will  be  properly \nanesthetized.    DOC_Add_21  (court  was  “gravely  concerned”  about  Doe’s \ncompetence).    Because  the  process  of  preparing  the  drugs  for  administration \n“involves precise measurements and the ability to use, decipher, and not confuse \nnumbers,”  DOC_Add_21,  Doe’s  dyslexia  and  admittedly  frequent  calculation \nerrors  render  him  unable  to  prepare  and  administer  anesthesia  reliably.  \nDOC_Add_21; DOC_App_III:659-60, 663, 685.  These findings are not clearly \nerroneous.    To  the  contrary,  they  are  supported by  extensive  expert  testimony \nregarding Doe’s numerous material errors and inability to prepare thiopental.  See \nsupra at 15-17. \nThe DOC complains that the Court “refers to no episode where Dr. Doe \naccidentally gave an incorrect amount of thiopental.”  DOC_Br_44.  In fact, Doe \nadmittedly gave an incorrect amount of thiopental in five of the last six executions.  \n32\n \n\n \nIndeed, Doe was unable even to state what dose he administered in any of these \nexecutions.  Having heard first-hand Doe’s testimony regarding his difficulties and \n12\nuncertainty about how much thiopental he prepared,  as well as Taylor’s experts’ \nconcerns, Judge Gaitan’s finding that Doe is incompetent and unable to reliably \nprepare adequate thiopental cannot possibly be clearly erroneous. \nc.  The DOC Has No Consistent Procedure. \nThe Court found that the execution procedure “as it currently exists is not \ncarried  out  consistently  and  is  subject  to  change  at  a  moment’s  notice.”  \nDOC_Add_20.  That finding is indisputable, as Doe had repeatedly altered the \nprocedure at his whim; his dyslexia creates unpredictability by preventing him \nfrom reliably preparing the doses; and he testified that he was “still improvising” \nwith respect to the execution procedure.  DOC_Add_18, 20-21.  Moreover, the \nDOC  had  never  attempted  to  regularize  its  procedures  by  creating  a  written \n13\nprotocol.  DOC_Add_20.  \n                                                 \n12\n The DOC mischaracterizes Doe’s testimony when it asserts that the “record \nreflected”  that  Doe  had  administered  at  least  2.5  grams  at  all  executions.  \nDOC_Br_42.    Doe’s  testimony  reveals  that,  as  Taylor’s  experts  testified,  it  is \nimpossible to determine how much thiopental Doe gave, and it may have been less \nthan 2.5 grams.  June_Tr_21, 222. \n13\n The DOC urges that the Eighth Amendment does not require a written protocol.  \nDOC_Br_41. Whether or not that is the case, the record supports the court’s factual \ndetermination that the DOC’s failure to institute a written protocol contributed to \nthe arbitrariness of its procedures.  DOC_Add_16-17, 20; DOC_App_III:704-5.  \n33\n \n\n \nThe DOC argues that Crawford testified that he would remedy this failure by \nmemorializing “[t]he chemicals, their amounts, and the order of administration.”  \nDOC_Br_41.  The DOC does not provide any basis, however, for finding clearly \nerroneous the court’s conclusion that the variability in the procedure was the result \nof  the  DOC’s  grant  of  unchecked  authority  to  Doe  and  his  incompetence.  \nDOC_Add_18,  20.    Simply  writing  down  the  doses  would  not  address  the \narbitrariness  of  the  procedure,  because  Doe’s  awareness  of  the  doses  he  was \nrequired to administer had not prevented him from making alterations in the past.  \nDOC_Add_18, DOC_App_644-45. \nd.  The Drug Delivery Mechanism Risks Improper \nAdministration. \nJudge Gaitan found that the DOC’s system of remote drug administration \ncreates the danger of erroneous administration.  He noted Doe’s testimony that “the \npeople who do the injections are nonmedical and they’re in the dark so they have a \nsmall flashlight,” as well as the impossibility of observing the inmate from the \nexecution support room.  DOC_Add_18, 21-22 (quoting Doe 31).  The court also \nheard expert testimony that the lack of “visibility of what they’re doing [is] a \ncompletely needless set-up for a problem,” as it risks syringe errors and prevents \nany observation of IV problems or inmate distress.  June_Tr_82.  In ordering that \nexecution personnel must be able to “see which drugs are being administered,” and \n34\n \n\n \nthat observation must be improved, then, the court found that the drug delivery \nsystem created a danger of erroneous administration.  DOC_Add_23. \nThe DOC apparently does not challenge this finding.  DOC_Br_46. \ne.  The DOC Does Not Monitor Anesthetic Depth. \nFinally,  Judge  Gaitan  found  that  the  DOC  does  not  monitor  inmates’ \nanesthetic depth in order to “ensure that [they have] received an adequate dose of \nanesthesia before the other two chemicals are administered.”  DOC_Add_21-22.  \nAlthough  Doe  testified  that  he  could  monitor  anesthetic  depth  by  viewing  the \ninmate’s face through a window, Judge Gaitan rejected that testimony based on his \nreview of videotaped simulations of each team member’s view into the execution \nchamber.  DOC_Add_21-22 (it would be “almost impossible” for Doe to observe \nfacial expression). \nThe  DOC  challenges  Judge  Gaitan’s  assessment  of  the  videotaped \ndemonstration based on its own opinion of that evidence.  DOC_Br_45.  Judge \nGaitan’s rejection of testimony is “virtually unreviewable on appeal,” however, \nUnited States v. Gomez-Perez, 452 F.3d 739, 743 (8th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks \nomitted),  and  his  evaluation  of  tangible  evidence  cannot  be  rejected  simply \nbecause the DOC disagrees.  Moreover, the court’s conclusion is also supported by \nexpert  testimony  that  Doe  is  unqualified  to  monitor  anesthesia  and  that  facial \n35\n \n\n \nexpression is in any event not a reliable means of monitoring.  June_Tr_72-76, 83, \n197-98, 239. \nf.  The Procedure as a Whole Subjects Inmates to a \nSignificant Danger of Inadequate Anesthesia. \nThe  court  found  that  taken  together,  these  “numerous  problems”  in  the \nexecution procedure create a risk of inflicting excruciating pain, because there is \nsignificant potential for inmates to be inadequately anesthetized.  DOC_Add_20.  \nThe court found that the risk present here was of sufficient magnitude to leave the \ncourt “gravely concerned” about the likelihood of error.  DOC_Add_21-22.  Far \nfrom being clearly erroneous, these findings are compelled by the record. \nThe  problems  described  above  materially  impede  the  DOC’s  ability  to \ninduce general anesthesia successfully.  The anesthetic Doe manages to prepare is \ndelivered  by  nonmedical  personnel  through  a  convoluted,  cumbersome  drug-\ndelivery  apparatus  allowing  no  visual  observation,  much  less  anesthetic \nmonitoring.  The DOC’s use of this dangerous system, combined with substantial \ndoubts  as  to  whether  inmates  have  been  adequately  anesthetized  in  the  past, \ncompels  the  conclusion  that  inmates  face  a  significant  risk  of  inadequate \nanesthesia.    June_Tr_71,  196;  see  Morales  III,  2006  WL  3699493,  at  *7-*8.  \nThough the danger of botched  executions  resulting  from  the  DOC’s  system  is \nfacially evident, the court’s conclusions are buttressed by medical expert testimony \nthat  these  systemic  problems  create  a  significant  risk  that  inmates  will  be \n36\n \n\n \ninadequately anesthetized or subjected to painful complications of central access.  \nJune_Tr_65, 81-83, 142, 168, 190. \nC.  The Court Correctly Concluded That the Procedure Is \nUnconstitutional. \nJudge Gaitan correctly found that the significant risk of excruciating pain \ncreated  by  the  DOC’s  execution  procedures  is  undue  and  unconstitutional.  \nDOC_Add_22.    The  substantial  danger  is  the  direct,  foreseeable  result  of  the \nDOC’s  conscious  choices  and  failure  to  take  available  steps  to  reasonably \nminimize that risk.  See Morales III, 2006 WL 3699493, at *7. \nThe DOC has chosen to use an excruciatingly painful execution method — \npotassium — despite the existence of painless alternative lethal-injection methods.  \nSee 1/31/06_Tr_18-19, 23.  The only way to avoid the certain infliction of pain \nusing this  method is  to  ensure that  inmates  are adequately  anesthetized.   This \nstandard is achievable; potassium executions need not risk excruciating pain if \nperformed with adequate safeguards. \nThe DOC’s multiple failures, however, have resulted in an unjustifiably high \nrisk  of  excruciating  pain.    Instead  of  acknowledging  and  minimizing  the \nforeseeable danger of inhumane executions, the DOC has instituted a needlessly \ndangerous  system,  while  displaying  a  shocking  lack  of  interest,  much  less \ndiligence,  as  to  whether  its  procedures  reasonably  ensure  adequate  anesthesia.  \nJune_Tr_374-75, 381.  This is an unreasonable way to run any state function, much \n37\n \n\n \nless one as grave and solemn as carrying out executions.  In light of the extreme \npain that will result from inadequate anesthesia and its manifest preventability, the \nsignificant risk the DOC’s procedures create is unreasonable and “incompatible \nwith … evolving standards of decency.”  DOC_Add_13-14 (quoting Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102 (1976)). \nII.  THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS REMEDIAL \nDISCRETION. \nA.  Standard of Review. \nIn a court-tried case where equitable relief is sought, this Court reviews the \n14\ndistrict court’s grant of an injunction for abuse of discretion.   Heartland Acad. \nCmty. Church v. Waddle, 335 F.3d 684, 689-90 (8th Cir. 2003).  “Once a right and \na violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to \nremedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.”  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).  \nThe district court’s discretion is exceeded only where it “rests its conclusion on \nclearly  erroneous  factual  findings  or  if  its  decision  relies  on  erroneous  legal \nconclusions.”  Smith v. Arkansas Dep’t of Correction, 103 F.3d 637, 644 (8th Cir. \n1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The district court’s exercise of remedial \ndiscretion  is  thus  closely  intertwined  with  the  district  court’s  factual  findings \n                                                 \n14\n  The  DOC  neglects  to  mention  this  applicable  standard  of  review.    See \nDOC_Br_26. \n38\n \n\n \nregarding  the  violation.    See  Hutto  v.  Finney,  437  U.S.  678,  686-87  (1978) \n(emphasizing  district  court’s  “ample  authority”  to  fashion  remedies  based  on \n“severity” of established violations); Smith, 103 F.3d at 646.  “[A]ppellate review \nis correspondingly narrow.”  RCA/Ariola Int’l, Inc. v. Thomas & Grayston Co., \n845 F.2d 773, 780 (8th Cir. 1988). \nB.  The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When, Having \nFound a Constitutional Violation, It Required the DOC To \nInclude a Physician with Training in Anesthesiology To \nParticipate in and Oversee Its Lethal-Injection Procedure. \nJudge Gaitan’s decision to require, as a remedial matter, that the DOC obtain \nthe services of a physician trained in anesthesiology to assess anesthetic depth is \ngrounded in, and justified by, the same record that required him to amend his \n15\nJanuary ruling and find a violation.   Taylor presented extensive evidence that the \nprocedure’s  systemic  problems  foreclose  any  assurance  that  inmates  will  be \nadequately anesthetized.  See supra Part I.  Remedying these problems is hardly \nsimple, because the DOC’s longstanding abdication of responsibility for the safety \nof  the  execution  procedure  leaves  it  unequipped  to  respond  effectively  now.  \nNeither Doe nor any other DOC employee understands the risks of the procedure, \n                                                 \n15\n Judge Gaitan’s June 26 order required that the DOC employ a board-certified \nanesthesiologist,  DOC_Add_23,  but  on  September  12  he  modified  that \nrequirement, broadening it to include “physician[s] with training in the application \nand administration of anesthesia.”  DOC_Add_27.  Both requirements were well \nwithin  the  court’s  remedial  discretion.    This  discussion  addresses  the  latter \nrequirement.  See infra Part II.D. \n39\n \n\n \nthe nature and dangers of the drugs, or the need to ensure adequate anesthesia.  \nThat  situation  persists  despite  the  DOC’s  opportunity  to  learn,  through  this \nlitigation, about these issues, as is evident from Crawford’s and Moore’s testimony \nand the DOC’s belief that merely specifying the drug doses would remedy all \nproblems.  June_Tr_351-52, 356-57, 372, 381; DOC_App_III:659-60, 692, 710. \nBased on the record established at trial, Judge Gaitan reasonably determined \nthat  neither  the  DOC’s  supervisory  personnel  nor  Doe  and  other  execution \npersonnel  could  reasonably  be  entrusted  to  fix  the  pervasive  problems  in  the \nexecution procedures or perform executions constitutionally.  Indeed, even were \nthe DOC to attempt to design such a protocol, Judge Gaitan recognized that DOC \nemployees’  past  conduct  and  present  recalcitrance  provided  ample  reason  to \n16\nconclude that they would ignore or be unable to follow the new instructions.   \nDOC_Add_20-21;  June_Tr_19.    Judge  Gaitan  therefore  reasonably  found  that \neffective monitoring of anesthetic depth by a qualified professional is the best way \nto  ensure  that  any  errors,  deviations  from  the  protocol,  misconduct,  or  drug \ndelivery failures will not result in inadequate anesthesia.  This conclusion was \n                                                 \n16\n Astoundingly, the DOC stated after the trial that if the full dose of thiopental \ncould  not be  mixed  in  the  future,  it  would  once  again deviate  from  its  stated \nprocedures  without  warning  and  administer  an  indeterminate  lower  dose  of \ninsoluble thiopental.  DOC_App_II:369.  The DOC’s disregard of the evidence that \nthis precise conduct creates a serious risk of inadequate anesthesia indicates the \nneed for anesthetic monitoring to guard against pain caused by such arbitrariness.   \n40\n \n\n \n17\nsupported by the testimony of Taylor’s expert anesthesiologists.   June_Tr_71, \n107, 196-198.  Taylor also presented extensive evidence that only persons who \nhave  advanced  training  in  anesthesiology  can  perform  anesthetic  monitoring, \n18\nparticularly on paralyzed patients.   See, e.g., Doc_App_II:249-50; June_Tr_at 26, \n196.  By providing effective monitoring, the DOC would ensure that whatever \ngoes wrong during the procedure, the inmate will not receive the painful drugs \n19\nuntil he is sufficiently anesthetized.  \nThus, the court’s injunction was an eminently reasonable, effective remedy \nfor an intractable problem, and as such clearly not an abuse of discretion.  See \nFrench v. Owens, 777 F.2d 1250, 1255 (7th Cir. 1985); Smith, 103 F.3d at 645.  \nIndeed, when medical expertise must inform an institution’s conduct, as Crawford \nconcedes is true of lethal-injection executions, June_Tr_382-83, 390, it is certainly \nreasonable  for  courts  to  require  that  decisions  be  made  by  a  “professional,” \n“competent” decision maker.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 & n.30 \n(1982)  (institution  would  be  liable  if  decision  about  involuntarily  committed \n                                                 \n17\n The DOC’s expert’s testimony is not to the contrary; Dershwitz testified that \nmonitoring  is  not  necessary  assuming  that  5  grams  of  thiopental  reaches  the \ncirculation – which is precisely what Judge Gaitan found the DOC is unable to \nensure.  June_Tr_284. \n18\n In contrast, EMTs, nurses, and physicians without training in anesthesia are not \nqualified to monitor anesthetic depth.  See DOC_App_II:251. \n19\n  Indeed,  Missouri  veterinarians  cannot  euthanize  animals  using  potassium \nwithout monitoring anesthetic depth.  See Mo. Ann. Stat. § 578.005(7), -007(7),-\n012. \n41\n \n\n \nward’s care was not “made by persons with degrees in medicine or nursing, or with \nappropriate training”); Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694, 697-98 (8th Cir. 1997). \nNor is Judge Gaitan’s remedy unduly burdensome.  The court recognized \nthat the DOC needed either to monitor the inmate’s anesthetic depth to ensure \nagainst pain, or dramatically change the procedure to ensure that the anesthetic was \ndelivered properly.  DOC_Add_27.  Had the court opted not to require monitoring, \nit would have had two options for changing the procedure to minimize the risk of \npain.  One approach would have been to impose detailed instructions about how to \nfix each step of the procedure.  See supra.  But this option would likely have been \na futile exercise, and would require extensive judicial supervision.  See Morales \nIII,  2006  WL  3699493, at  *9  (detailing systemic  changes  in  consultation  with \nindependent experts and suggesting Governor oversee revision process in light of \nDOC’s incompetence and recalcitrance).  A second course would have been to \norder the DOC to stop using pancuronium and potassium and instead execute using \nonly a massive dose of thiopental.  See Taylor_App_51; DOC_Br_56 n.10; see \nalso Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1047 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (“Morales \nI”) (same), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006); \nMorales III, 2006 WL 3699493, at *10.  But the Court deferred to the DOC’s \ndesire to continue using the three-drug protocol.  DOC_Add_26.  Thus, the Court’s \nchosen remedy — ordering that one qualified individual ensure that none of the \n42\n \n\n \nprocedure’s problems results in inadequate anesthesia — is, compared to its other \n20\noptions, both unintrusive and eminently reasonable.  \nNor is this remedy anomalous.  In Morales II, the Ninth Circuit refused to \nfind  it  an  abuse  of  discretion  for  the  district  court  to  have  ordered  that  an \nanesthesiologist  “take  all  medically  appropriate  steps  necessary  to  ensure” \nunconsciousness.  Morales II, 438 F.3d at 931.  As here, the Morales district court \nrecognized that such a step was needed to ensure sufficient anesthesia and, hence, \n21\nthe constitutionality of this same three-drug sequence.  \nThe  DOC  contends  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  does  not  require  that  a \ntrained professional monitor anesthetic depth.  DOC_Br_52.  This misses the point.  \nAnesthesiologists  are  not  constitutionally  required  to  participate  in  all  lethal-\ninjection executions, as Judge Gaitan recognized.  DOC_Add_27.  But that does \nnot mean that it is an abuse of discretion for the district court to require one as an \nexercise  of  remedial  discretion  where,  as  here,  it  has  found  a  constitutional \nviolation based on findings that the current procedure fails to ensure sufficient \n                                                 \n20\n Morales III recognized that California had these same three options.  2006 WL \n3699493, at *9-10. \n21\n It is true, as the DOC points out, that the Morales court presented the DOC with \na  choice  of  employing  an  anesthesiologist  or  eliminating  pancuronium  and \npotassium.  See Morales I, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1047-48.  But this merely confirms \nthat Judge Gaitan’s remedy was among the appropriate options.  That California \nchose  the  anesthesiologist  option  over  using  the  one-drug  procedure  further \ndemonstrates that Judge Gaitan’s remedy was not only permissible but may be \npreferable to a department of corrections. \n43\n \n\n \nanesthetization and the DOC intends to continue using drugs which indisputably \n22\ncause pain and suffering upon administration to a conscious person.   This Court \nobserved this distinction in Smith.  There, the district court found that the prison \nhad  breached  its  constitutional  obligation  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  protect \ninmates  from  brutal  violence.    Smith,  103  F.3d  at  644-45.    Having  found  a \nviolation, the court then granted injunctive relief requiring the defendants to station \nadditional guards in the prison’s open barracks.  Id. 642.  Reviewing for an abuse \nof  discretion,  this  Circuit  held  that  this  remedy  would  not  be  constitutionally \nrequired  in  every  case,  but  was  “reasonable”  in  light  of  the  evidence  of  the \nconstitutional violation.  Id. 646; see also Jensen v. Clarke, 94 F.3d 1191, 1200-01 \n(8th Cir. 1996); French, 777 F.2d at 1252. \n                                                 \n22\n  For  this  reason,  the  cases  cited  by  the  DOC  in  support  of  its  argument, \nDOC_Br_52-53, are inapposite.  In those cases, courts found, usually without the \nbenefit of any discovery, that the lethal-injection procedures at issue did not create \nan unreasonable risk of pain.  It was therefore unnecessary to consider whether \nanesthetic monitoring was necessary.  The case on which the DOC most heavily \nrelies, Evans v. Saar, 412 F.Supp.2d 519, 524 (D. Md. 2006), demonstrates the \ninvalidity of the DOC’s argument.  There, the court refused to grant a preliminary \ninjunction  on  Evans’  lethal-injection  claim.    Subsequently,  however,  the  court \nconducted a bench trial, at which Evans presented extensive evidence that the \nprocedures are unreasonably dangerous.  The court is now considering whether to \nremedy the violation by ordering that an anesthesiologist monitor executions.  See \nBrian Witte, Maryland Told to Explore Using Doctors for Executions, Baltimore \nSun,  Dec.  6,  2006,  available  at  http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-\ndeathpenalty1206,0,5637317.story?coll=bal-local-headlines  (last  visited  Dec.  19, \n2006). \n44\n \n\n \nJust as remedy in Smith could not be reversed as an abuse, so too must the \ndistrict court’s anesthesia-monitoring requirement stand.  Indeed, the remedy in \nSmith was far more intrusive than the district court’s:  it commandeered trained \ncorrectional officers for a particular purpose, thus taxing a limited prison resource \nand interfering directly in prison administration and security.  Given that the DOC \nhas already brought in an outsider (Doe) to participate in dozens of executions, \nJudge  Gaitan’s  requirement  that  the  DOC  recruit  another  professional  of  its \nchoosing surely does not so impose on these interests. \nIn light of the procedure’s “numerous” flaws, the deference that must be \nafforded  that  factual  finding,  and  the  court’s  broad  equitable  discretion,  this \n23\nremedy cannot possibly be an abuse of discretion.  \nC.  The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Denied \nthe DOC’s Request to Modify the Injunction. \nInstead of trying to comply with the court’s injunction, the DOC submitted a \nprotocol  that  sought  to  redefine  the  remedy —  a  thinly  veiled  request  for  the \ndistrict  court  to  modify  its  injunction.    The  standard  for  reviewing  an  order \n                                                 \n23\n The DOC also misses the point when it contends that the Eighth Amendment \ndoes not require the doctor selected to be in good standing.  See DOC_Br_54-55 & \nn.8.  Once again, this requirement emerges from the scope of the violation.  The \nDOC’s last doctor, Doe, performed the procedure so dangerously that Judge Gaitan \nfelt compelled to bar his participation in executions.  See DOC_Add_27.  Given \nthe  DOC’s  poor  record  in  selecting  execution  personnel,  Judge  Gaitan’s \nrequirement  that  the  doctor  be  in  good  standing  is  entirely  appropriate  and \nmanifestly not beyond the scope of the violation.  See Smith, 103 F.3d at 646.  See \nalso supra note 3. \n45\n \n\n \nrefusing to modify an injunction is the same abuse of discretion standard used to \nreview decisions to grant an injunction in the first place.  See 16 Charles Alan \nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3924.2, at 212 (2d ed. 1996); see \nalso Surgidev Corp. v. Eye Tech., Inc., 828 F.2d 452, 458 (8th Cir. 1987).  The \ncourt’s rejection of the written protocol cannot be deemed such an abuse. \nThe DOC’s written protocol neither complies with the court’s injunction nor \nrescues the procedure from its manifest flaws.  As noted above, the district court \nrequired  the  DOC  to  monitor  the  inmate’s  anesthetic  depth  using  a  qualified \nprofessional.  The DOC’s  protocol does not do so.  Instead, it proposes monitoring \ninmates with “medical personnel” — that is, a doctor, nurse, or EMT.  Taylor \npresented extensive evidence, however, that personnel without formal training in \nanesthesiology are unable to monitor anesthetic depth, particularly in paralyzed \n24\ninmates.     June_Tr_69,  85;  DOC_App_II:252-53.    In  rejecting  the  DOC’s \nmonitoring plan, Judge Gaitan also rejected the DOC’s assertions that personnel \n25\nwithout  anesthesia  training  can  effectively  monitor  anesthetic  depth.   \nDOC_Add_27.  Moreover, the proposed protocol allows the existing personnel, \nincluding Doe, to perform the monitoring function, see Protocol at 1, despite their \n                                                 \n24\n The written protocol lists some clinical techniques for monitoring anesthetic \ndepth,  Protocol  at  3,  but  those  techniques  cannot  be  competently  applied  by \nsomeone without training in anesthesiology.  See DOC_App_II:252. \n25\n The DOC fails to acknowledge this point.  DOC_Br_60. \n46\n \n\n \n26\ntrack record of incompetence.   Far from constituting an abuse of discretion, the \n27\ndistrict court was well within its authority to reject the DOC’s monitoring plan.  \nNor does the proposed protocol attempt to remedy the procedure’s other \n“numerous problems,” DOC_Add_20-21, instead affixing a few cosmetic changes \nonto  an  irreparably  broken  system.    To  understand  the  proposed  protocol’s \ndeficiencies, one must understand the nature of Judge Gaitan’s remedy.  Aside \nfrom  requiring  the  DOC  to  have  a  qualified  physician  undertake  anesthetic \nmonitoring, Judge Gaitan sensibly entrusted many important specifics of the new \nprocedure  to  the  discretion  of  the  physician  in  consultation  with  the  DOC.  \nDOC_App_I:200-01.  That approach makes eminent sense, as the overriding flaw \nin the DOC’s current system is that it is run by personnel — from the Director to \nthe execution team members — who do not understand the procedure and its risks. \nThus, even aside from the lack of anesthetic monitoring, the DOC’s proposal \nundermines  Judge  Gaitan’s  carefully  calibrated  remedy.    The  written  protocol \n                                                 \n26\n Tellingly, the DOC has never disavowed its intent to continue using existing \npersonnel, including Doe, to perform executions.  See June_Tr_387-89 (Crawford \nintends  to  continue  using  same  personnel,  including  Doe);  see  generally \nDOC_App_II:360-71. \n27\n The DOC argues that its monitoring was adequate because Doe, who is untrained \nin anesthesiology, could see the inmate’s facial expression through a window from \nanother room.  See DOC_Br_45.  The DOC’s continued intention to rely on an \nunqualified  person  to  monitor  anesthetic  depth  through  a  window,  despite  the \ncourt’s  findings,  demonstrates  that  the  DOC  cannot  be  trusted  to  perform  this \nprocedure without the addition of a qualified professional. \n47\n \n\n \ncannot be evaluated in isolation as an abstract document, because it must always be \ngiven effect by the personnel who carry it out.  That is particularly the case here, as \nthe  protocol,  like  the  injunction  itself,  leaves  much  to  the  discretion  of  the \nexecution personnel, including, inter alia, IV access, thiopental preparation, drug \nadministration, and inmate observation.  DOC_Add_32-34.  Instead of having that \ndiscretion  exercised  by  a  physician  with  the  anesthesia  training  necessary  to \nunderstand the risks of the procedure, as Judge Gaitan contemplated, the DOC \nenvisions vesting discretion in Doe and the same unqualified, untrained personnel \nwho have always deferred to him. \nThe DOC’s proposed protocol thus perpetuates the grave flaws that prevent \nthe DOC from even being able to ensure compliance with its own procedures.  \nIndeed, Judge Gaitan made extensive findings that the DOC’s personnel were both \n28\nunwilling and unable to perform their tasks properly.   The DOC also intends to \nuse the same convoluted drug delivery apparatus that simultaneously creates a risk \nof problems and hinders detection of those problems.  June_Tr_77-78.  Far from \nobviating  the  need  for  the  court’s  injunction,  the  written  protocol  thus \ndemonstrates that the DOC will not change unless forced to do so.  See Jensen, 94 \n                                                 \n28\n  For  example,  the  new  protocol,  extraordinarily,  permits  Doe  to  prepare  the \ndrugs, even though the court found that the procedure is complicated and Doe is \nincompetent to perform it.  This problem cannot be cured merely by delegating the \npreparation to another member of the team, because no one on that team possesses \nthe necessary skills and qualifications.  DOC_App_III:665; see also Morales III, \n2006 WL 3699493, at *6-*7 (registered nurse unable to mix thiopental).   \n48\n \n\n \nF.3d  at  1200-01  (citing  defendants’  inadequate  remedial  plan  as  evidence  that \nviolation would continue); French, 777 F.2d at 1254. \nThe district court therefore correctly found that this new protocol created \nsignificant risk of suffering.  See DOC_Add_27.  This factfinding is reviewed for \nclear error and cannot be reversed so long as Judge Gaitan’s view of the evidence \nis plausible.  See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573.  The court’s view is unquestionably \n“plausible.”  Accordingly, its rejection of the new protocol and refusal to modify \nthe injunction cannot be an abuse of discretion. \nD.  The DOC Has Not Taken Adequate Steps To Locate A Physician \nWith Training In Anesthesiology, So Its Objection To That \nRequirement Is Premature. \nThe DOC argues that the district court erred in mandating that a physician \nwith  training  in  anesthesiology  assist  during  executions,  because  it  could  be \nimpossible  to  comply  with  such  a  requirement,  thus  effectively  barring \nimplementation of the death penalty in Missouri.  The DOC, however, has made \nonly the most minimal effort to comply, sending out 298 “cold-call” letters to local \nanesthesiologists by regular mail just eight days before it announced that it was \nunable to retain anyone.  There are tens of thousands of anesthesiologists in the \nUnited States; a cursory letter to 298 does not remotely demonstrate that it is \n“impossible” to procure one.  See DOC_App_II:258.  Furthermore, after the DOC \nsent its letters, the district court amended its order to encompass other physicians \n49\n \n\n \nwith training in anesthesiology, see DOC_Add_27, thereby broadening the field of \ncandidates.  Notwithstanding the DOC’s unelaborated claim that it continues to \nsearch for a doctor, see DOC_Br_65, nothing in the record suggests that it has \nattempted to take advantage of this broader universe of eligible physicians. \nThe DOC’s suggestion that no doctor will be willing to participate is simply \nwrong.  Studies demonstrate that 25% of physicians would personally perform five \nor  more  actions  intrinsic  to  lethal  injection,  and  19%  would  be  willing  to \n29\nadminister the lethal drugs themselves.   DOC_App_II:257-58.  There are, to be \nsure, ethical issues involved, but these studies make clear both that there is no \nmonolithic  ethical  position  in  the  medical  community,  and  that  many  doctors \nwould be willing to participate.  Additionally, no professional-association rules or \n30\nMissouri laws impose sanctions for doctors’ participation.   See DOC_App_342, \n347. \n                                                 \n29\n There is no reason to believe that the attitudes of anesthesiologists would be any \ndifferent.  See DOC_App_II:257-58.  Indeed, at a recent panel of the American \nSociety of Anesthesiologists (ASA), one anesthesiologist stated that he considered \nit an ethical duty to assist with lethal injection because prisoners “are suffering and \nI have the ability to help them.”  See Clinical Forum: Medicalizing executions \nplaces anesthesiologists on slippery slope, ASA Daily News 2006, Oct. 15, 2006, \navailable  at  http://www.asadailynews.com/Sunday.html  (last  visited  Dec.  31, \n2006). \n30\n Indeed, earlier in this litigation, the DOC itself confirmed that neither the AMA \nCode of Ethics nor any Missouri ethical rule or law would prohibit or penalize \nphysician participation in executions.  Taylor_App_16-17.  Moreover, while the \n50\n \n\n \nHaving barely begun the process of locating someone, the DOC’s objection \nto this requirement is premature and frivolous.  See United States v. Santee Sioux \nTribe of Neb., 254 F.3d 728, 736 (8th Cir. 2001) (litigants bear burden of showing \nin detail that compliance with court order is impossible). \nFinally,  were  the  DOC  ultimately  unable  to  find  someone  after  further \ngenuine efforts, it would still have ways to implement the death penalty.  It could, \nfor instance, adopt a one-drug procedure or ask the district court to modify its \ninjunction based on a more rigorous showing of impossibility.  Accordingly, the \ninjunction in no event bars implementation of the death penalty. \nIII.  THE DISTRICT COURT APPLIED THE CORRECT EIGHTH \nAMENDMENT STANDARD. \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  DOC’s  challenges  to  Judge  Gaitan’s \nrulings are entirely meritless.  The DOC’s alternative tack on appeal is to assert an \neviscerated Eighth Amendment standard that restricts only execution procedures \nthat are guaranteed and intended to cause pain.  The DOC never raised these \narguments to the district court, and they are waived.  Wiser v. Wayne Farms, 411 \nF.3d 923, 927 (8th Cir. 2005); Becker v. University of Nebraska, 191 F.3d 904, 909 \nn.4 (8th Cir. 1999) (“A party may not stand idly by … and allow[] the [district \ncourt] to commit error of which [the party] subsequently complains.”).  Moreover, \n                                                                                                                                                             \noutgoing ASA president advised anesthesiologists to “steer clear,” his words have \nno binding effect.  See DOC_App_II:262. \n51\n \n\n \nthe arguments are indefensible.  No precedent supports the DOC’s standard, which \ntolerates even the most unnecessary and unreasonable risks of pain, and which \nexcuses  even  the  cruelest  execution  methods  so  long  as  the  officials  do  not \nexplicitly intend to inflict pain.  In contrast, the standard adopted by the district \ncourt —  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  bars  methods  of  execution  that  impose \nunreasonable risks of pain — is the law of the land. \nA.  Standard of Review. \nThis Court reviews questions of law de novo.  Antolik v. Saks, Inc., 463 F.3d \n796, 798 (8th Cir. 2006). \nB.  The Eighth Amendment Forbids Execution Procedures That \nCreate An Unreasonable Risk Of Pain. \nThe  Eighth  Amendment  bars  the  imposition  of  “cruel  and  unusual \npunishment.”  U.S. Const. amend. VIII.  The Supreme Court has long interpreted \nthis  phrase  to  bar  punishments  “incompatible  with  the  ‘evolving  standards  of \ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’”  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 \nU.S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958)). \nJudge  Gaitan  found  that  although  the  unforeseeable  “risk  of  accident,” \nDOC_Add_26, does not violate the Eighth Amendment, the DOC may not use \nexecution methods that create an “unnecessary” or “unreasonable risk” of pain, \nDOC_Add_26.  That conclusion is plainly correct.  The DOC acknowledges that \nthe  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  “unnecessary”  infliction  of  pain.  \n52\n \n\n \nDOC_Br_28 (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976)).  Thus, the \nDOC is constitutionally obligated to reasonably minimize the pain that it inflicts on \ncondemned inmates. But maintaining a procedure that creates an unnecessary risk \nof pain does not reasonably minimize pain, because that procedure will inevitably \ncause unnecessary pain in real executions.  It is entirely proper to require the DOC \nto correct that unnecessary risk now, rather than after Taylor’s execution when it \nwill be too late to safeguard his constitutional rights.  Moreover, such unreasonable \nrisks are by definition “totally without penological justification,” Jorden v. Farrier, \n788  F.2d  1347,  1348  (8th  Cir.  1986)  (quoting  Gregg,  428  U.S.  at  183),  and \ninconsistent “with the evolving standards of decency,” Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102 \n(internal quotation marks omitted), because they needlessly subject inmates to a \npainful execution.  Even Justices who have taken a narrower view of the Eighth \nAmendment’s protections have recognized such punishments are impermissible.  \nSee Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 430 (1972) (“[N]o court would approve any \nmethod of implementation of the death sentence found to involve unnecessary \ncruelty in light of presently available alternatives.”) (Powell, J., dissenting, joined \nby Burger, C.J., Blackmun, J., and Rehnquist, J.). \n The correctness of Judge Gaitan’s ruling is confirmed by the many cases \nthat  have  adopted  the  same  standard.    See  Evans  v.  Saar, 412  F.Supp.2d 519, \n524 (D. Md. 2006) (asking “whether an inmate facing execution has shown that he \n53\n \n\n \nis subject to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain or suffering”) (emphasis \nadded; internal quotation marks omitted); Morales III, 2006 WL 3699493, at *1 \n(“[T]he Eighth Amendment prohibits … procedures that create an ‘unnecessary \nrisk’ [of pain.]”) (emphasis added); Cooey, 430 F.Supp.2d at 708 (finding that \n“Ohio’s lethal injection protocol giv[es] rise to the unacceptable risk of violating \nthe Eighth Amendment[]”) (emphasis added); Baze v. Rees, No. 2005-SC-0543-\nMR, __S.W.3d__, 2006 WL 3386544, at *2 (Ky. Nov. 22, 2006) (“[The test is \nwhether  the]  procedure  for  execution  creates  a  substantial  risk  of  wanton  and \nunnecessary infliction of pain.”) (emphasis added); Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d \n1029, 1033 (9th Cir. 2004) (Cooper must show “he is subject to unnecessary risk \nof  unconstitutional  pain”)  (emphasis  added).    Although  these  courts  use  slight \ndifferences in phraseology, they are crystal clear that risk of pain is central to the \nEighth Amendment analysis. \nDespite this precedent supporting the district court’s standard, the DOC now \nargues that no risk, no matter how unreasonable and foreseeable, can give rise to a \nconstitutional violation.  But that argument is waived, as the DOC never presented \nit to the district court.  Indeed, although the DOC challenged many other aspects of \nthe district court’s decision, it repeatedly embraced a risk standard in defending its \nrevised  protocol:  “The  protocol  proposed  by  the  Department  of  Corrections \ncomplies with the Eighth Amendment in that it … does not subject condemned \n54\n \n\n \nprisoners  to  a  foreseeable  and  undue  risk  of  unnecessary  and  wanton  pain.”  \nDOC_App_II:360 (emphasis added); see also DOC_App_II:361, 362, 364, 366, \n370.    Likewise,  although  Taylor’s  amended  complaint  alleges  an  Eighth \nAmendment  violation  on  the  basis  of  the  “foreseeable  risk”  of  pain, \nDOC_App_II:87-88, the DOC did not claim this was the wrong standard in its \nmotion to dismiss.  Nor did the DOC articulate the argument in its June pre-trial \nbrief.  It is entirely improper for the DOC to argue for a new standard on appeal.  \nWiser, 411 F.3d at 927. \nEven if the argument were preserved, it should still be rejected as erroneous.  \nThe DOC calls the risk standard “novel,” DOC_Br_32, yet its brief ignores nearly \n31\nall of the cases cited above that apply the standard.   Nor does the DOC’s standard \nmake any sense given that it permits even the most dangerous means of execution \nso long as they are not guaranteed to be cruel and unusual.  The DOC’s standard \nwould insulate haphazard execution practices from constitutional review because \nof the impossibility of demonstrating that those practices were absolutely certain to \ncause pain.  No decision from any court ignores risk in the manner the DOC urges. \n                                                 \n31\n The DOC claims that the risk standard articulated in Cooper is the product of a \npreliminary  injunction  analysis.    DOC_Br_31-32.    Yet  preliminary  relief  for \nCooper depended not on showing that it was likely that the execution method was \nguaranteed to cause pain, but that it was likely the execution method presented an \nunreasonable risk of causing pain.  Cooper, 379 F.3d at 1033. \n55\n \n\n \nCertainly the cases that the DOC cites do not support its extreme position.  \nNoting  that  “all  human  activity  entails  risk,”  DOC_Br_32,  the  DOC  cites  the \n32\nplurality opinion in Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947),  \nfor  the  proposition  that  the  “risk  of  accident”  does  not  create  an  Eighth \nAmendment  violation.    DOC_Br_33.    That  citation  is  doubly  inapt.    First, \nResweber  did  not  even  involve  a  claim  that  death  by  electrocution  created  an \nunreasonable  risk  of  pain;  the  prisoner’s  claim  was  only  that  it  would  be \npsychologically cruel and unusual to subject him to electrocution a second time \nafter  the  first  attempt  was  unsuccessful.    Resweber,  329  U.S.  at  464.    Thus, \nResweber simply has nothing to do with the issue before this Court.   \nSecond, even indulging the DOC’s misreading of Resweber, Judge Gaitan, \nas  noted  above,  explicitly  rejected  the  notion  that  the  unavoidable  “risk  of \naccident” inherent in all human activity could give rise to an Eighth Amendment \nviolation.  DOC_Br_33.  Judge Gaitan found instead that the constitution bars only \nforeseeable and unreasonable risks of excruciating pain, a standard fully consistent \nwith Resweber.  Compare DOC_Add_22 (finding a violation in light of “undue \nrisk” of pain) with Resweber, 329 U.S at 464 (declining to find a violation on the \nbasis of an “unforeseeable accident”) (plurality opinion).  Indeed, Judge Gaitan’s \n                                                 \n32\n  Although  the  DOC  does  not  mention  it,  the  Eighth  Amendment  ruling  in \nResweber secured the votes of only four Justices; Justice Frankfurter concurred in \nthe judgment on different grounds. 329 U.S. at 466-72 (Frankfurter, J., concurring \nin the judgment). \n56\n \n\n \nformulation  is  suggested  by  Resweber  itself,  which  reached  only  the  limited \nconclusion that “[a]s nothing has been brought to our attention to suggest the \ncontrary, we must and do assume that the state officials carried out their duties … \nin a careful and humane manner,” Resweber, 329 U.S. at 462 (emphasis added).  \nThe other cases that the DOC cites as purportedly abandoning the risk standard \nimpose these same restrictions.  See, e.g., Malicoat v. State, 137 P.3d 1234, 1237 \n(Okla. Crim. App. 2006) (finding that the mere risk of accident does not violate the \nEighth Amendment, so long as the State takes “appropriate precautions and rel[ies] \nupon adequate training, skill, and care in doing the job”).  In short, while the \nEighth Amendment does not require the DOC to prevent the unforeseeable, it is \nrequired to remedy the foreseeable likelihood of excruciating pain.  \nThe pair of nineteenth-century cases that the DOC cites are also unavailing.  \nIn Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1878) and In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436 (1890), \nthe  Supreme  Court  considered  challenges  to  execution  by  firing  squad  and \nelectrocution, respectively.  But both cases involved entirely different types of \nEighth Amendment challenges than the one at issue here.  The prisoners did not \nallege that the method of execution contained some foreseeable risk that would \ncause  unconstitutional  pain;  their  claim  was  that  death  by  firing  squad  and \nelectrocution were inherently unconstitutional, even if carried out without error.  \nAs such, those cases had no reason to address the relevance of unreasonable risk, \n57\n \n\n \nlet alone to hold it irrelevant.  Moreover, just because executions no longer take \nplace using the facially unconstitutional methods discussed in those opinions, such \nas the rack and screw, the DOC cannot avoid Eighth Amendment scrutiny by \nadopting a potentially proper method of execution like lethal injection but carrying \n33\nit out in an unreasonable manner.   See Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 \n(1910)  (“[W]e  cannot  think  that  [the  Eighth  Amendment]  was  intended  to  … \nprevent only an exact repetition of history.”). \nThe  DOC  is  left  to  argue  that  a  reasonableness  standard  is  untenable.  \nDOC_Br_32-34.    That  canard  is  rebutted  by  courts  every  day  as  they  assess \nreasonableness in countless contexts in order to apply legal standards.  What would \nbe wholly untenable is to exempt from constitutional review all execution methods \nnot guaranteed to cause pain.   That legal standard would make a procedure’s mere \npotential to be carried out painlessly a complete defense to the all too real risks the \nDOC’s actions create. \nBecause the DOC has waived its “certain pain” argument, and because the \nargument is an incorrect interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, this Court should \nreject it. \n                                                 \n33\n  Indeed,  the  DOC’s  “guaranteed  pain”  requirement  would  permit  even  the \ncruelest  methods  of  punishment  because  no  method  of  execution  is  strictly \nguaranteed ex ante to cause pain in all cases.  Any number of contingencies might \narise, such as the prisoner who dies or loses consciousness instantly. \n58\n \n\n \nC.  Cruel and Unusual Execution Methods Do Not Become \nConstitutional When They Are Unintended. \nThe  DOC’s  second  argument  is  that  whatever  pain  and  suffering  its \nexecution procedures create, there can be no Eighth Amendment violation unless \nprison officials intend to cause that pain and suffering.  Again, the DOC creates a \nprecedentless standard inconsistent with Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. \nAs an initial matter, the DOC never argued the necessity of scienter to the \ndistrict court.  The claim is waived and not properly before this Court.  Wiser, 411 \nF.3d at 927. \nBut even if it had been validly raised, the argument would still be incorrect.  \nMens rea has no place in an Eighth Amendment review of the means by which a \nstate carries out its punishment of death.  The intent of the executioner plainly does \nnot lessen the pain he causes.  See Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 682 & n.12 \n(9th Cir. 1994) (review of the “methodology” of an execution is concerned only \nwith  “objective  evidence  of  the  pain  involved”  and  a  “deliberate  indifference \nstandard is not directly applicable” to it) (emphasis added)). \nIn response, the DOC relies almost exclusively on cases involving prison \nconditions and the like.  DOC_Br_36-37.  To be sure, mens rea may be relevant to \nactions taken incident to punishment, such as with cell overcrowding or medical \ncare,  lest  every  error  in  the  prison  context  “become  a  constitutional  violation \nmerely because the victim is a prisoner.”  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106.  But the state \n59\n \n\n \naction at issue here is not “incident” to punishment; the method by which the DOC \nchooses to perform the lethal injection is the punishment — indeed it is the most \nprofound punishment that the DOC may impose.  No case has ever held mens rea \nrelevant to those actions; on the contrary, case after case has considered challenges \nto execution methods without ever inquiring into subjective state of the officers \nwho carry it out.  E.g., LaGrand v. Stewart, 173 F.3d 1144, 1148-49 (9th Cir. \n1999) (finding execution by cyanide gas unconstitutional based on “substantial \nrisk” of severe pain, without considering scienter); Cooey, 430 F.Supp.2d at 708 \n(same for lethal injection); Morales I, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1039. \nIndeed, the only execution case that the DOC cites for its intent standard is \nthe  Resweber  plurality.    But  while  that  opinion  noted  that  Louisiana  lacked  a \n“purpose to inflict unnecessary pain,” it is clear from context that the plurality \nmeant only that the “unforeseen accident” that led to a failing of the electric chair \nwas  in  fact  truly  an  accident.    Resweber,  329  U.S.  at  464  (“The  fact  that  an \nunforeseeable accident prevented the prompt consummation of the sentence cannot \n... add an element of cruelty to a subsequent execution.  There is no purpose to \ninflict unnecessary pain ....”).  Thus, while a showing of malicious purpose could \nbe  relevant  to  an  inquiry  into  whether  mistakes  by  the  DOC  were  truly \n60\n \n\n \nunforeseeable,  Resweber’s  plurality  imposed  no  general  rule  that  purpose  is  a \n34\nnecessary component of unconstitutional pain.  \nIn sum, the DOC has waived any argument about scienter, and its arguments \nare flawed in any case.  Its claim of error must therefore be rejected. \n                                                 \n34\n Even if this Court were to conclude that intent were necessary, a standard no \nhigher than deliberate indifference is justified.  Higher mens rea is reserved only \nfor  situations,  such  as  prison  riots,  where  officials  are  “in  haste  [and]  under \npressure.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 835 (1994).  Judge Gaitan’s ruling \namply supports a finding of deliberate indifference, i.e., “recklessness.”  Id. 836.  \nThe  district  court  found  that  Crawford  was,  and  intends  to  remain,  “totally \ndependent” on Doe regarding medical procedures, and that Doe, despite knowing \nthat he had significant trouble with dosages, continued to administer executions.  \nDOC_Add_18-20; supra note 16.  That is tantamount to a finding of deliberate \nindifference.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, 846 & n.9 (recklessness can be inferred \nwhere “risk is obvious” and court has found a risk exists); Jensen v. Clarke, 94 \nF.3d 1191, 1200 (8th Cir. 1996) (defendants’ post-trial conduct indicated deliberate \nindifference).    In  all  events,  imposing  a  mens  rea  requirement  at  most  would \nrequire remanding the case to Judge Gaitan to enter findings on the point. \n61\n \n\n \nCONCLUSION \n  Judge Gaitan’s decision should be affirmed, and this Court should remand to \nthe district court so that the DOC may comply with the court’s rulings. \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n________________________________ \n \nC.

      "text": "DECLARATION OF SRIKUMARAN (SRI) K. MELETHIL, PH.D., J.D. \n \nSrikumaran (Sri) K. Melethil, Ph.D., J.D., declares under penalty of \nperjury as follows: \n1.  My name is Srikumaran (Sri) K. Melethil, Ph.D., J.D.  I am a \npharmacokineticist.  My curriculum vitae is attached to this declaration.  \nPharmacokinetics is the science of how drugs act in the body over time. \n2.  On September 19, 2005, I was contacted by Elizabeth Unger \nCarlyle, an attorney in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.  She explained to me that \nshe represented an intervenor plaintiff, Richard Clay, in a U.S. District \nCourt case involving Missouri’s lethal injection procedure.  She sought my \nexpert testimony in connection with that case.  I agreed to help. \n3.  Over the past several months, Ms. Carlyle and I have conferred \nseveral times about the issues in the case and the need for discovery as to \nthe conclusions of the state’s expert.   \n4.  On January 18, 2006, Ms. Carlyle contacted me by e‐mail and told \nme that a hearing date on the case might be imminent; she asked for and \nwas given my conflict dates. \n  1\n\n5.  On January 26, 2006,, Ms. Carlyle contacted me again.  She \ninformed me that a merits hearing was scheduled for February 21‐22, and \nthat my testimony likely would be needed on February 21. \n6.  On January 30, 2006, Ms. Carlyle attempted to contact me by \ntelephone and e‐mail to inform me of the immediate hearing in the case.  \nBecause I was traveling, I did not receive these communications until \nTuesday, January 31, 2006.  I spoke with her that day. \n7.  I have reviewed the testimony and affidavits of Dr. Mark \nDershwitz, the state’s expert in this case, which was presented in the case \nof Timothy Johnston.  For the purposes of this declaration, I am assuming \nthat his testimony in Mr. Taylor’s case was similar. \n8.  Dr. Dershwitz has indicated, based in part on a graph which he \npresented, that the blood level of sodium thiopental which would be \npresent in the executed prisoner’s blood at the time of death was \nsufficiently high that the prisoner would become unconscious shortly after \nthe administration of sodium thiopental and would remain unconscious \nuntil death.  Dr. Dershwitz has not, to my knowledge, provided the data on \n  2\n\nwhich he bases this conclusion.  My own study of the area reveals no data \nsupporting this conclusion.   \n9.  The level of the drug in the brain, rather than that in the blood, \ndetermines whether a person will be unconscious.  Dr. Dershwitz presents \nno data about measured brain levels of thiopental, either in humans or in \nlaboratory animals.  (For obvious reasons, it is impossible to determine the \nbrain level of thiopental in a living human.) \n10.  Attached to this declaration is a graph showing the decline in the \nlevel of sodium thiopental in laboratory rats over time.  The graph \nindicates that the decline is quite rapid.  This is no surprise, because one of \nthe reasons sodium thiopental is used clinically is that it wears off quickly.  \nThis characteristic decline in brain levels makes me suspicious that Dr. \nDershwitz’s conclusions about consciousness and blood levels may be \ninaccurate. \n11.  Because I still do not know what data Dr. Dershwitz used, I \ncannot now express an opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty \n  3\n\nabout his conclusions.  However, if I had access to his data, I would be able \nto do so. \n12.  Goodman & Gilman’s, The Pharmacological Basis of Therepeutics, 9th \nEd., a standard reference in pharmacology, notes that in surgical situations, \nthe dosage of sodium thiopental needed for sedation varies with the \nperson.  Some people need larger doses than others.  At p. 323, the \nreference notes, “Patients who require a large initial dose of thiopental will \nawaken despite plasma concentrations that normally would cause sleep.”  \nBased on this reference, it is my opinion that blood levels of thiopental are \nnot necessarily determinative of whether a particular person will actually \nbe asleep during a procedure.  Thus, I believe that the issue of whether \npersons subjected to the Missouri protocol will suffer unnecessarily due to \nthe failure of anesthesia deserves further study. \nSigned under penalty of perjury this 1st day of February, 2006. \n \n          ____________________________________ \n          Srikumaran (Sri) K. Melethil, Ph.D., J.D. \n  4",

BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff filed the instant complaint on June 3, 2005, and an amended complaint\nwas filed on September 12, 2005 (Doc. #36)1.  On December 28, 2005, the Court issued\nan Order denying defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and ruling that the case presented\nfactual issues which would likely be resolved by either a motion for summary judgment\nor through a hearing (Doc. # 54).  On January 3, 2006, the defendants notified the Court\nthat the Supreme Court of Missouri had set plaintiff’s execution date for February 1,\n2006.  On January 18, 2006, plaintiff filed an Application for a Court Order requesting\nthat the Court issue an Order directing that Taylor not be executed until further order of\nthe Court to be issued within a reasonable time after a hearing on the merits which was\nscheduled for February 21, 2006.  On January 19, 2006, Judge Scott Wright issued an\nOrder staying the execution until the Court could conduct the hearing (Doc. # 62).  The\n1 Richard Clay was previously granted leave to intervene in this action.  On\nJanuary 30, 2006, the Court orally granted Mr. Clay’s Motion to Dismiss this action as to\nhim without prejudice.  Reginald Clemons also had a pending Motion for Leave to\nIntervene in this action. He has now moved to withdraw from this action. \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 2 of 9(cid:10)\nsame day, defendants appealed Judge Wright’s ruling to the Eighth Circuit. On January\n29, 2006, the Eighth Circuit entered an Order reversing and vacating Judge Wright’s\nJanuary 19, 2006 Order.  The Eighth Circuit remanded the case to the Western District\nand directed that the Court reassign the case to another judge for an immediate\nhearing.  The Eighth Circuit directed that an Order shall be issued no later than 12:00\nNoon on Wednesday, February 1, 2006.  This case was assigned to this Court on\nMonday, January 30, 2006.  The Court conducted a telephonic hearing on January 30-\n31, 2006 and now addresses the issues which were presented. \nIn his First Amended Complaint plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that  \nMissouri’s method of execution by lethal injection violates the Eighth, Thirteenth and\nFourteenth Amendments because it would inflict on him cruel and unusual punishment,\nwould deprive him of life, liberty or property without due process of law and would inflict\nupon him a badge of slavery, in that the three drug sequence using a procedure\nwhereby the drugs are administered through the femoral artery creates a foreseeable\nrisk of the infliction of gratuitous pain.  Plaintiff also argues that the physician’s role in\nthe execution violates medical ethics. \nII. EVIDENTIARY HEARING\nDuring the telephonic hearing, the Court heard the testimony of the following\nindividuals: Dr. Mark Dershwitz, Dr. Jonathan I. Groner, Dr. Mark Heath and Terry W.\nMoore, the Director of Adult Institutions for the Missouri Department of Corrections. \nMr. Moore testified that when an inmate is executed, the procedure is\naccomplished through the use of three drugs which are administered by a board\n2\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 3 of 9(cid:10)\ncertified physician.  The physician first administers five grams of sodium pentothal, also\nknown as thiopental, which is a substance that produces anesthesia.  Thereafter, the\nphysician administers a syringe of saline to flush the IV line.  Next, the physician\nadministers pancuronium bromide, also referred to as pancuronium.  This drug is a\nparalytic agent which prevents any involuntary movement of the body.  The physician\nthen again administers the saline solution.  Finally, the third drug which is administered\nis potassium chloride, which is a drug which stops the electrical activity of the heart.  Mr.\nMoore testified that the average time to complete administration of the drugs is between\ntwo and five minutes and the average time of death from when the drugs are\nadministered until the time of death was between two and five minutes.  Dr. Dershwitz\ntestified that if the above outlined protocol is followed, there is no chance that an inmate\nwould experience pain or suffering. \nPlaintiff presented the testimony of Dr. Groner.  Dr. Groner is a pediatric surgeon.\nHowever, he is not an anesthesialogist, nor does he administer anesthesia.  Dr. Groner\ntestified that the pancuronium bromide does not have any function in bringing about the\ndeath of an inmate, but that the sole affect of this drug is to relax the inmate’s muscles. \nAdditionally, he testified that the potassium chloride also is not necessary because the\nfirst drug which is administered, thiopental, is lethal in the amount in which it is given. \nHe also testified that the administration of these drugs through the femoral venous\ncatheter is unnecessary and that the drugs could easily be administered through\nperipheral veins located in the arms. Dr. Groner testified that he believes there is a\nsignificant risk that an inmate would experience  pain and suffering under the current\n3\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 4 of 9(cid:10)\nprotocol.  \nPlaintiff also presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Heath.  Dr. Heath is a board\ncertified  anesthesiologist.  Dr. Heath testified that Missouri is unique in its requirement\nthat the drugs be administered through the femoral vein.  He does not believe that it is\nreasonably necessary and that a safer alternative would be to administer the drugs\nthrough a peripheral artery located in the arm.  He agreed with the testimony of Dr.\nGroner that five grams of sodium pentothal would be a lethal dose.  However, he stated\nthat the length of time in which death would occur would vary from person to person. \nOn the low end the drug could cause death in one to two minutes or it might take up to\ntwenty minutes.  He also agreed with Dr. Groner that there is no need for the use of \npancuronium bromide to bring about the death of an inmate.  Dr. Heath also testified\nthat he does not believe that the use of potassium chloride is necessary to bring about\nan inmate’s death.  He stated that the administration of this drug is very painful if a\nperson is conscious.  He also stated that there are alternative drugs which also stop the\nheart which are not painful when administered. \nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Missouri’s Means and Method of Execution\nThe Eighth Amendment provides that “cruel and unusual punishment” shall not\nbe inflicted.  It  prohibits punishments that are “incompatible with the ‘evolving standards\nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’” Estelle v. Gamble 429 U.S.\n97, 102 (1976).  As to executions, it prohibits “the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\n4\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 5 of 9(cid:10)\npain” as well as methods involving torture or a lingering death.  See Gregg v. Georgia,\n428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976).  “The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a\nconvicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary\nsuffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.”  Louisiana ex\nrel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947)(emphasis added).  Additionally, as\nthe Court noted in Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir. 1994), “the risk of\naccident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution process in order to\nsurvive constitutional review.”   \nPlaintiff argues that the sequence of the three chemicals mentioned above\n(sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride) are unnecessary as a\nmeans of employing lethal injection and they create a foreseeable risk of inflicting\ngratuitous pain and suffering.  However, based upon the testimony which was\npresented by the witnesses, the Court does not find that there is a significant risk that\nthe means and method which the Missouri Department of Corrections uses will cause\nunnecessary pain and suffering.  Dr. Dershwitz testified that the dose of sodium\npentothal which is administered, 5 grams, has a very long lasting effect.  Thus, the\nlikelihood that the inmate will still be conscious when the other drugs are administered is\nhighly unlikely.  Other courts who have examined this procedure have also found that it\nis not cruel and unusual.  In Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4-04-CV-1075 CAS, (E.D.Mo.\nAug. 26, 2005), the Court stated:\nPlaintiff’s evidence is inadequate to demonstrate that Missouri’s execution\n5\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 6 of 9(cid:10)\nprotocol would subject him to the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain, torture or a lingering death.  Plaintiff’s evidence suggests only a\npossibility, rather than a probability, that he may remain conscious and\nsensate long enough to experience pain during his execution. For\ninstance, in the affidavit of Dr. Heath submitted in support of the TRO\nmotion, Dr. Heath opines that “the failure to properly administer the\nsodium pentothal” would create an unjustifiable risk that a prisoner will be\nconscious during the remainder of the execution. But as previously noted\nthe ever-present possibility of human error or accident is insufficient to\nestablish a constitutional violation. Louisiana ex rel. Francis, 329 U.S. at\n464; see also Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105; Beardslee, 395 F.3d at 1075.  \n     Furthermore, plaintiff’s evidence does not adequately demonstrate the\nnature or the duration of the possible pain relative to the likely degree of\nsedation so as to establish that the quantum of pain would violate Eighth\nAmendment standards. . . . The record fails to establish any foreseeable\nprobability that the use of the Missouri protocol would result in an\nexecution involving torture or unnecessary pain of unconstitutional\nmagnitude or length. \nId. at pp. 4-5.  This conclusion has been reached by other courts that have also\nconsidered challenges to lethal injection protocols.  In Beardslee v. Woodford, No. C 04-\n5381 JF, 2005 WL 40073  (N.D.Cal. Jan. 7, 2005), aff’d, 395 F.3d 1064 (2005),  the\nCourt stated, “even with protocols under which only two grams of sodium pentothal - as\nopposed to the five grams used in California - are to be administered, the likelihood of\nsuch an error occurring ‘is so remote as to be nonexistent.’” Id. at * 3.  See also Reid v.\nJohnson, 333 F.Supp.2d 543 (E.D.Va. 2004).  Therefore, the Court does not find that\nthe plaintiff has demonstrated that Missouri’s means of accomplishing lethal injection\nviolate the Eighth Amendment. \nPlaintiff also argues that method by which the drugs are administered is also\ncruel and unusual in that the drugs are administered through the femoral vein, rather\nthan through a vein in the inmate’s arm.  However, the Court is also not persuaded that\nthis constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  The testimony was that an injection is\nadministered to numb the area before the catheter is inserted so that the inmate will\n6\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 7 of 9(cid:10)\nexperience little if any pain.  There was testimony that complications can arise with the\nplacement of the catheter and that it might become dislodged or that it is sometimes\ndifficult to locate the femoral vein.  However, as noted above, these slim possibilities do\nnot show that the procedure is cruel and unusual. \nB. Role of Physician - Violation of Medical Ethics\nPlaintiff also argues that the defendants will violate his right to due process of law\nby executing him by using a physician to carry out the essential steps in the execution in\nviolation of the physician’s medical ethics.  Other courts have addressed this and found\nthat it does not violate the physician’s code of ethics to participate in an execution.  In\nAbdur ‘Rahman v. Bredesen, No. M2003-01767-COA-R3-CV, 2004 WL 2246227, * 9\n(Tenn.Ct.App. Oct. 6, 2004), aff’d, 2005 WL 2615801 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2005), the Court\nnoted, “the Tennessee Supreme Court noted that ‘no public policy is violated by\nallowing physicians or anyone else to participate in carrying out a lawful sentence.’” Id.\nat *9 quoting Coe v. Sundquist, No. M2000-00897-SC-R9-CV (Tenn. Order Apr. 19,\n2000).  The Court finds that this is likely the way Missouri courts would also rule on the\nissue.  Indeed, if physicians were not involved in supervising and administering the\ndrugs, it is likely that inmates would claim that it was cruel and unusual punishment\nbecause Department of Corrections personnel, without any medical training, were\nadministering the drugs.  \nC. Violation of the Thirteenth Amendment\nFinally, plaintiff claims that the chosen form of lethal injection is a vestige and\nbadge of slavery and therefore violates the Thirteenth Amendment as well as the Eighth\nand Fourteenth and impinges on the vertical-equity (color and socio-economic status of\naccused) and the horizontal equity (irrationality of who among the mass of homicide\n7\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 8 of 9(cid:10)\ndefendants gets the death penalty, irrespective of color and socio-economic status). \nThe Thirteenth Amendment provides that:\n     Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within\nthe United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added).  Defendants argue that the Thirteenth Amendment does not\napply in this case because this case involves neither slavery nor involuntary servitude. \nEven if it did, defendants argue that the Amendment specifically makes exception for\ninstances in which a person is being punished for a crime.  In Wendt v. Lynaugh, 841\nF.2d 619, 620 (5th Cir. 1988), the Court stated:\n     The record is clear that Wendt had been duly convicted of a crime and\nwas serving sentence in the Texas prison as punishment for that crime.\nHis situation in precise words is exempted from the application of the\nThirteenth Amendment.  He is in no position to claim a right under the\nThirteenth Amendment. \nSimilarly in Draper v. Rhay, 315 F.2d 193 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 915, 84 S.Ct.\n214, 11 L.Ed.2d 153 (1963)  the Court stated:\n     Where a person is duly tried, convicted, sentenced and imprisoned for\ncrime in accordance with law, no issue of peonage or involuntary servitude\narises. . . . The Thirteenth Amendment has no application where a person\nis held to answer for a violation of a penal statute. \nId. at. 197 (internal citations omitted).  \nAdditionally, defendants point out that Missouri’s method of execution is used on\nall inmates who have been sentenced to death, regardless of their race.  In order to\nshow a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, defendants argue that plaintiff would\nhave to show that prisoners of different races were treated differently.  This plaintiff has\nfailed to do.  Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a\nviolation of the Thirteenth Amendment. \n8\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 76     Filed 01/31/2006     Page 9 of 9(cid:10)\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAfter considering the evidence and testimony which was presented during the\nevidentiary hearing,  the Court finds that neither the chemicals used by the State of\nMissouri for lethal injection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  While the plaintiff suggests a different\napproach to lethal injection, he does not prove that the current method used by Missouri\nviolates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  Further the Court is not persuaded\nthat the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violates\napplicable standards of the Eighth Amendment.  The Court also does not find that\nMissouri physicians who are involved in administering the lethal injections are violating\ntheir ethical obligations nor that the procedure is violative of the Thirteenth Amendment.\nThe Court GRANTS the Motion of Reginald Clemons to Withdraw his Motion to\nIntervene (Doc. # 72). \nDate: January 31, 2006           S/ FERNANDO J.

Defendants’\nsubmission was in compliance with this Court’s order of June 26, 2006 (Doc. #195). \nPlaintiff is opposed to the proposed protocol submitted by the State because he\nbelieves that the protocol still fails to comply with many aspects of this Court’s June 26,\n2006 Order and also because the protocol perpetuates the unnecessary risk of causing\nexcruciating pain during the lethal injection process. \nIn the June 26, 2006 Order, this Court amended its Order of January 31, 2006\nand certified this case to the Eighth Circuit for their review and consideration. \nAdditionally, on July 24, 2006, the State filed a Notice of Appeal with the Eighth Circuit. \nAccordingly,  jurisdiction over this matter no longer rests with this Court.  \nThis Court’s order of June 26, 2006, was never intended to unreasonably delay\nMissouri’s execution of death row inmates.  Instead, the goal of this Court was to\nguarantee that those executions were conducted in a constitutional manner.  Missouri’s\ncurrent lethal injection procedure subjects condemned inmates to an unnecessary risk\nof unconstitutional pain and suffering.  Without appropriate monitoring of the anesthesia,\nthere is a strong argument that these executions might even be torturous.  The\nevidence presented by plaintiff’s counsel supported that argument.  \nMissouri’s revised proposal is an improvement over the current procedure. \nHowever, there continue to be inadequacies with the personnel required to monitor and\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 203     Filed 07/25/2006     Page 2 of 2(cid:10)\noversee the use of the anesthetic thiopental.  While the use of a board certified\nanesthesiologist may not be possible, the alternative proposed by the State falls short of\nensuring the protection required. \nIf the proposed three drug approach is to be used, it is crucial that someone with\nthe appropriate training and experience in monitoring anesthetic depth must be present\nto ensure that Missouri’s executions of its condemned inmates are carried out\nhumanely.  \nAs this case is now before the Eighth Circuit, the Court is confident that the\nparties will present their positions on the revised protocol to that Court. \n/s/Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr.\nUnited States District Judge\nDated:      July 25, 2006    \nKansas City, Missouri\n2",

Whether the district court clearly erred in entering judgment \nagainst Taylor in that the evidence was not sufficient to support its \nfindings? \nFirst National Bank v. Benham, 423 F.3d 855, 861 (8th Cir. 2005) \n \nShelton v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 277 F.3d 998, 1007 (8th \nCir. 2002). \n \n \n‐ vi ‐ \n\nStatement of the Case \nOn June 3, 2006—actually before he had ascertained all of the specific \nmeans by which the State of Missouri intended to execute him—the \npetitioner filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Taylor v. Caldwell, No. 05‐\nCV‐4173‐SOW, seeking to raise federal constitutional grievances \nconcerning the chemicals, personnel, and other incidents involved in the \nState of Missouri’s practice of lethal injection.  After the Missouri Supreme \nCourt set an execution date in the previous leading case in this area, \nJohnston v. Campbell, Mr. Taylor’s counsel learned that in its lethal \ninjections, the state uses a precursor operation variously referred to as \n“central line access” or “femoral vein access” and that the state uses a \nlicensed physician in the process in violation of the Hippocratic Oath and \nthe AMA Code of Ethics.  Richard D. Clay, another condemned person in \nthe Missouri Department of Corrections, intervened in the action, \nrepresented by Elizabeth Unger Carlyle and Jennifer Herndon.  Plaintiffs \nfiled an amended complaint setting forth their claims about the precursor \noperation and the physician participation. \n\nOn December 28, 2005, the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Missouri issued an order denying the defendant’s \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and holding that the case \nneeded to go forward.  The next business day, the undersigned counsel \nfaxed a copy of this order to the Missouri Supreme Court with a cover \nletter advising it of the order.  The second business day after counsel \nprovided this notice, the Missouri Supreme Court set an execution date \nagainst Michael Taylor, the lead plaintiff in the federal action. \nOn January 19, 2006, the Hon. Scott O. Wright issued an order setting \na hearing in the federal case for February 21, 2006, with the hearing to go \nover to February 22 if the Court needed a second day’s worth of evidence.  \nThrough Magistrate Judge William A. Knox, Judge Wright had the \nprevious day informed counsel that he had tried to set the hearing before \nFebruary 1, 2006, but that he could not do so in light of pending matters on \nits calendar.  Without giving a reason or offering any intermediate course \nof action, counsel for the defendants indicated they would seek relief from \nJudge Wright’s order. \nOn January 20, 2006, the defendants filed an application to vacate \nJudge Wright’s preliminary injunction, to which I prepared a response.  On \nJanuary 27, 2006, counsel for Reginard Clemons, another condemned \n‐ 2 ‐ \n\nperson in the Missouri Department of Corrections, filed a motion to \nintervene in the action.  Mr. Clemons is represented by New York City law \nfirm which would have provided substantial litigation firepower for the \nplaintiffs at the hearing on February 21, 2006. \nOn January 29, 2006, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Eighth Circuit vacated Judge Wright’s order, directed the Chief \nJudge of the district court to reassign the case to another district judge, and \ndirected the new district judge to conduct a hearing immediately and to \nrender judgment by noon on the date the Missouri Supreme Court had set \nfor the execution.  It also stayed the execution through 11:59 p.m. on \nFriday, February 3, 2006. \nIn light of the panel’s mandating another snap hearing—as had \noccurred in the Donald Jones, Vernon Brown, and Timothy Johnston cases \nwith which the undersigned was familiar—and the new district judge’s \nrefusal to let counsel call the physician who participates in Missouri’s \nexecutions, counsel for Messrs. Clay and Clemmons, respectively, \ndismissed their claims without prejudice and withdrew their motion to \nintervene. \nThis left the undersigned sole practitioner alone to litigate a snap \nhearing in a capital case involving several experts.  Simply procuring their \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\nparticipation by phone took substantial time and effort.  Counsel was not \nable to contact one of them, who had been out of town, until the morning \nof the second day (yesterday), and he could not be ready to testify until the \nnext day, which the new district judge did not allow.  As a result of these \nunusual and irregular demands, the undersigned was unable to do the \nkind of job on this capital case involving arcane scientific subjects that he \nwould typically do on the least grave and sensitive matters in his practice. \nBecause he had to conduct a telephone hearing solo two days in a \nrow, the undersigned counsel was unable to prepare a pleading in this \nCourt to seek to have the very order requiring the hearing overturned, and \nhad to suspend my activities in support of execution clemency, which the \nsame court has authorized me to engage in under its appointment. \nDefendants sought to have the Supreme Court vacate this Court’s \npanel’s stay in its entirety.  That Court declined.  After the district judge \nissued the order, rendered inevitable by the circumstances under which the \nlawyers tasked to handle the hearing while the undersigned handled \nclemency advocacy, were removed by the technical knock‐out of December \n29, 2006, the defendants filed a motion before this Court to vacate its three‐\nday stay.  The undersigned did not receive this motion by e‐mail until a \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\nfew minutes before this Court acted on it; he did not receive it by fax at the \nnumber in his letterhead (or any other fax number) until (according to the \nreadout on his fax machine) 9:26 p.m., or “21:26,” i.e., only three minutes \nbefore this Court e‐mailed counsel its ruling on the motion. \nHaving received no response to the state’s motion (for the reason just \nspecified), the panel cut its stay back to 5:00 p.m. today.  Defendants were \nnot satisfied with that, and applied to the Supreme Court to vacate its stay \nin its entirety. \nThis appeal followed.  Appellant e‐mailed an application for a stay of \nexecution from this Court to the Court, opposing counsel, and the Supreme \nCourt at 9:58 a.m. today. \n‐ 5 ‐ \n\nSummary of Argument \nMichael Taylor has not had an opportunity to litigate the substance \nhis claims fully and fairly since the removal of the district judge who had \nbeen handling the case by regular assignment from its inception.  Over and \nabove enforcing the constraints resulting from the panel’s order, the new \ndistrict judge precluded him from presenting evidence from the only \nwitnesses qualified to give it.  He refused to allow Mr. Taylor’s counsel to \nprepare and present a witness within the time this Court’s panel had \nallowed the sp to hear and rule on the case, when that witness was not \nprepared earlier because of his absence from the geographical area and the \nfact that no one could have foreseen the specific nature of the panel’s order.  \nThese omissions are directly or indirectly the fruit of the defendants’ and \ntheir privies’ manipulation of the judicial process to prevent anyone from \nreceiving an eff hearing on the merits of claims relating to their form of \nlethal injection.  The Supreme Court of the United States has recently set its \nface against the broadside denial of review of federal constitutional claims \nrelating to lethal injection where, as here, the executioners rely on the legal \nfiction that a section 1983 action is a successive section 2254 petition when \n‐ 6 ‐ \n\nit stands a chance of winning relief, and where, as here, the claims involve \na medically unnecessary precursor procedure such as a cut‐down, central‐\nline access, or femoral‐vein access. \n‐ 7 ‐ \n\nStandard of Review \nSufficiency of the evidence to support the judge’s factual findings is \nreviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.  Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. \nArkansas Dept. of Human Services, 293 F.3d 472, 479 (8th Cir. 2002); Camberos \nv. Branstead, 73 F.3d 174, 177 (8th Cir. 1995). \nThe district court’s action in excluding or admitting evidence is \nreviewed for abuse of discretion.  First National Bank v. Benham, 423 F.3d \n855, 861 (8th Cir. 2005).  But the issue of whether these rulings denied the \nappellant due process of law is reviewed de novo.  Shelton v. Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, 277 F.3d 998, 1007 (8th Cir. 2002). \n‐ 8 ‐ \n\nArgument \nI.

Plaintiff Michael Taylor was precluded from presenting his \ncase by the order of this Court and the additional decisions of the district \ncourt foreshortening the process established by the regularly assigned \ndistrict judge and refusing to allow counsel to present evidence even \nwithin the short time this Court’s panel allowed for the specially \nassigned district judge to render judgment. \nPetitioner state officials and their privies have created the supposed \ntime bind on the basis of which they persuaded this Court to order the \ndistrict court to engage in the foreshortened consideration of a case in \nwhich the regularly assigned judge had denied a motion to dismiss and \nhad set a hearing, resulting in a denial of relief.  As privies of the State of \nMissouri, the defendants‐appellees here are estopped to complain of any \n“delay” on the part of Mr. Taylor in bringing his section 1983 action, as \ntheir state supreme court (which sets Missouri execution dates) has held \nthat a Missouri condemned person cannot seek relief from a method of \nexecution until its specific modalities are ascertained, which cannot be until \nshortly before or after the execution.  See Worthington v. State, 166 S.W.3d \n566, 583 n.3 (Mo. 2005) (en banc), in which the Missouri Supreme Court \n‐ 9 ‐ \n\nrejected a Missouri condemned person’s challenge to the state’s lethal‐\ninjection procedure by holding it premature: \nAs it is unknown what method, if any, of lethal \ninjection may be utilized by the State of Missouri at \nsuch future time, if any, as Mr. Worthington’s right \nto seek relief in state and federal courts is concluded \nand his execution date and method are set, it is \npremature for this Court to consider whether a \nparticular method of lethal injection violates the \nEighth Amendment because it causes lingering, \nconscious infliction of unnecessary pain. \nIt is the strategy they have used in the Timothy Johnston case and \nhere:  if someone has a good challenge to their lethal‐injection practices \ngoing in federal court, they set an execution date once the district court \ndenies the motion to dismiss.  Someone should be able to litigate these \nclaims fairly:  it should now be Michael Taylor after the Eighth Circuit or \nthis Court reverses the judgment which the district court entered after a \nmere simulacrum of a “hearing.” \nIn arguing to the Supreme Court that the action of the district court in \nconducting a truncated hearing on the merits of this case should affect the \ncourt’s order staying Mr. Taylor’s execution, the defendants omit \nsignificant facts relevant to that hearing. \n‐ 10 ‐ \n\nPursuant to this Court’s order of Sunday, January 29, 2006, the \ndistrict court attempted to conduct a hearing on the merits of this matter on \nMonday, January 30, 2006 and Tuesday, January 31, 2006.  The new judge \nselected for the purpose began proceedings with a telephone conference at \n10:00 a.m.  This was approximately two hours after counsel for plaintiff \nlearned of the order; he had been traveling on January 29, 2006 and did not \ncheck his e‐mail until that morning.  During the conference, the court \nexpressed some concern about the logistics of such a rapid hearing.  While \nthe court concluded that it could conduct a fair hearing within the confines \nof the time provided by this Court, the district court allowed with the \ndefendants’ acquiescence, the intervenor to withdraw.  The intervenor’s \nmotion to dismiss stated, as cause for the dismissal: \nBased on their evaluation of their ability to present \nadequately Mr. Clay’s claims in the hearing \ncontemplated by the court, Mr. Clay’s counsel do \nnot believe that his interests will be served by \nfurther participation in this case.  He cannot fairly \npresent his claims and evidence to the court in the \nlimited time allowed for the hearing in this matter.  \nSince he is not under execution warrant, he has no \nneed to limit his presentation based on the \nconstraints on Mr. Taylor.  His interests are now \ndivergent from those of Mr. Taylor, and he will be \n‐ 11 ‐ \n\nprejudiced if he is required to continue as a party to \nthis action. 1  \nBy granting this motion, both the district court and the defendants \nimplicitly conceded that a fair hearing was impossible.  Further \ndevelopments made that even clearer. \nA. The district court abused its discretion and denied the \nplaintiff due process of law in that it precluded him from presenting \nthe physician and nurse who participate in Missouri executions. \nAt the initial telephone conference, the district court denied the \nplaintiffs the right to call the doctor and nurse who have participated in \nmultiple executions pursuant to the protocol proposed by the state in this \ncase.  At issue in this case is whether this protocol results in unnecessary \nand excessive pain and suffering.  While not dispositive, it is at least \nrelevant to this issue whether the medical professionals who conduct the \nexecution are alert to the possibility of such pain and suffering during the \nprocedure.  It is also relevant whether they have observed symptoms in \nexecuted persons which indicate that these persons are suffering \n                                           \n1Motion To Dismiss Action Without Prejudice As To Intervenor, Dist. \nCt. Doc. 71. \n‐ 12 ‐ \n\ndiscomfort during the procedure.  Plaintiff was unable to present this \nevidence because of the court’s peremptory ruling excluding it.  Nor was \nthe plaintiff able to determine whether the qualifications of the medical \nprofessionals involved were in fact as the defendant Crawford said they \nwere, because the court refused to provide the plaintiff with the identity of \nthe medical professionals.  The court below, in the case of Timothy Johnston \nv. Larry Crawford et al., denied a writ of prohibition sought by the state and \nrequired that the identities be provided to Johnston’s counsel pursuant to a \nprotective order.  Mr. Taylor did not even have the benefit of that limited \ndiscovery before a final hearing on the merits of his case. \nB. The district court abused its discretion and denied the \nplaintiff due process of law in that it refused to allow him to present \nthe testimony of a pharmacokinetics expert whom the plaintiffs’ \ncounsel before the suit was truncated had arranged to testify on the \nregularly assigned judge’s hearing date, but who was inaccessible \nuntil the second day of the “hearing” by telephone. \nIn addition to the inability to present evidence in support of his claim \nfrom crucial fact witnesses, the short period provided by the court below \nand its specially assigned judge prevented Mr. Taylor from presenting \n‐ 13 ‐ \n\nevidence from Dr. Sri Melethil, Ph.D., J.D., a pharmacokineticist.  Dr. \nMelethil had previously consulted with counsel for the plaintiffs’ team and \nexpressed concern about the data on which the opinions of Dr. Mark \nDershwitz, the state’s expert, were based.  In particular, Dr. Melethil is \naware that the rate at which sodium thiopental leaves the brain is greater \nthan that at which it leaves the blood.  Dr. Dershwitz’s conclusions were \nbased on blood levels, but it is the brain level which determines whether \nanesthesia has occurred.  Dr. Melethil was out of town and out of touch \nuntil the morning of January 31, 2006.  Because complete discovery had not \nbeen obtained from Dr. Dershwitz, and because of Dr. Melethil’s previous \ncommitments, counsel for Mr. Taylor were unable to provide him with the \ndata he needed to form an expert opinion in this matter.   \nOn appeal, it is likely that the judgment of the district court will be \noverturned.  First, the exclusion of testimony from medical personnel who \nactually witness executions clearly violated Fed. R. Evid. 401.  While a \ndistrict court’s rulings on exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of \ndiscretion, such abuse occurs when the court bases “its ruling on an \nerroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the \nevidence.”  Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990), cited in \nBeck v. Haik, 377 F.3d 624 (6th Cir. 2004).  Under Fed. R. Evid. 401, \n‐ 14 ‐ \n\n“’relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the \nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the \naction more probable or less probable  than it would be without the \nevidence.”  Here, the issue is whether the mode of execution employed by \nthe State of Missouri causes unconstitutional pain and suffering.  To hold \nthat testimony by medical personnel (trained observers of symptoms) who \nactually participate in the execution is irrelevant to this determination flies \nin the face of the expansive language of Rule 401.  In Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d \n624 (6th Cir. 2004), the court reversed the judgment on the grounds that the \ntrial court improperly excluded both expert evidence bearing on a \ncontested issue, and a letter which the court held “would clearly support \none of the plaintiffsʹ main theories of the case.”  Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d at \n637‐38.  The court held that the cumulative effect of these errors was \nprejudicial, and reversed the judgment. \nThis case is also similar to Riordan v. Kempiners, 831 F.2d 690, 697 (7th \nCir. 1987), where the judgment was reversed after the trial court sustained \nthe defendants’ motions in limine and excluded much of the plaintiff’s \nevidence.  The court noted, “[A]s the judge’s discretion was exercised on a \nwholesale basis before trial began, rather than in response to the \ndeveloping course of the trial, careful appellate review is necessary to make \n‐ 15 ‐ \n\nsure the judge did not truncate the trial prematurely.”  Since the state in \nthis case presented no evidence as to the lack of pain and suffering during \nthe execution process, and presented no witnesses who had personally \nobserved the process in Missouri, the plaintiff’s lack of opportunity to \nexplore this area is even more serious. \nThe lack of notice of the hearing also deprived the plaintiff of the \nability to prove his claim.  The situation, while somewhat unique, is similar \nto the denial of a continuance, and can be examined using the same \nstandards.  At the close of the hearing, plaintiff’s counsel attempted to \nmake an offer of proof to the court of the information he was seeking from \nhis expert, Dr. Melethil, but could not do so because of the time‐pressure \ncreated by the January 29, 2006, order of the court below and Dr. Melethil’s \nabsence from the state.  Because this expert has not yet been able to obtain \nthis data, he is unable to be more specific about his opinion.  It should be \nnoted, however, that Dr. Dershwitz did not testify concerning this data, \nalthough his testimony was presented in support of the defendants’ case. \nSee also Gibson v. Weber, 433 F.3d 642 on the prejudice from not \nallowing a party to call a witness. \n‐ 16 ‐ \n\nII.  The district court clearly erred in entering judgment against \nTaylor in that the evidence was not sufficient to support its findings. \nThe plaintiff’s experts testified that the drug used to cause death, \npotassium chloride, is extremely painful when administered.  They further \ntestified that this drug caused a needless risk of pain, in that there were \nother drugs which would also cause death with less suffering.  The district \ncourt refused to allow the presentation of evidence as to what actually \nhappens during an execution, which the plaintiff proposed to present \nthrough the medical personnel who were actually present.  The defendants \npresented evidence from a correctional official, but he testified only as to \nthe protocol used, not to his personal knowledge of its practical \napplication. \nIn its judgment, the district court relied on testimony from Dr. \nDershwitz that the first drug administered, sodium thiopental, would \nrender the executed person unconscious for a sufficient period that, \nordinarily, the person would feel no pain.  Dr. Dershwitz presented no \ntestimony about the data he used to form this opinion, and had never \nwitnessed a Missouri execution.  The plaintiff’s experts, on the other hand, \ntestified that there was a risk of pain, and that it could easily be avoided by \n‐ 17 ‐ \n\nthe use of drugs other than those presently used in Missouri.  This meets \nthe standard of “cruelty inherent in the method of punishment,” cited by \nthe district court.  Using a process that creates a known risk of pain when \nother procedures exist which minimize this risk is cruel and unusual \npunishment.  We are not talking here about accidental errors in the \nadministration of a proper protocol.  There is evidence here that the \nprotocol itself is unduly subject to risks which will cause unnecessary pain.  \nFor example, the Missouri protocol requires the use of femoral vein access \nwhether or not such access is required in a particular patient.  \nUncontroverted evidence was offered that this procedure is much more \ncomplex and subject to error than the use of a regular intravenous line.  \nThe state presents no justification for exposing executed persons to this \nadditional risk of discomfort. \nThe district court further cited Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4‐04‐CV‐1075, \nCAS (E.D. Mo. August 26, 2005).  That order was entered after a truncated \nsummary judgment proceeding, not a trial on the merits.  The proceedings \nin that case were even more limited than those in this case.  Thus, the \ndecision in Johnston is not precedent supporting the district court’s \njudgment here. \n‐ 18 ‐ \n\nTaylor offers to prove that the facts in a hearing free from the time‐\npressure that the defendants and their privies created by manipulating the \njudicial process would be as follows: \nThe district court wrote in the background (page 2) that the ”the \ndrugs are administered through the femoral artery.”  This is incorrect.  In \nfact, the drugs are intended to be administered through the femoral vein.  \nAdministering these drugs via the femoral artery would cause immediate \nand excruciating pain.  The point is not trivial in that Dr. Dershwitz himself \nacknowledged in his testimony that inadvertent placement of the catheter \ninto the artery is not a rare occurrence.  In Dr. Dershwitz’s world (the \noperating room), this is not seen as a “mistake” since an arterial catheter \ncan be used for blood pressure monitoring and blood samples.  However, \nin the lethal injection world, this would guarantee an excruciating death. \nAccording Mr. Moore’s testimony, the drugs are administered by a \nphysician.  This activity, combined with the doctor placing the central line, \nprovide an unpresedented level of physician participation in executions.  \nThere is simply no other parallel in modern history (outside of the killing \n‐ 19 ‐ \n\nof German citizens in the Nazi “euthanasia program,”) where doctors \npersonally injected drugs into people in order to kill them. \nThe district court’s opinion is that the inmate is unlikely to \nexperience any pain with the femoral vein catheter insertion because the \nskin is numbed by local anesthetic.  As Dr. Groner testified, the likelihood \nof severe pain is not due to the “seeker needle” piercing the skin, but rather \ndue to the possibility of it striking nerves or bone (which is  exquisitely \nsensitive).  Dr. Dershwitz himself acknowledged that he would refuse \nplacement of a femoral venous catheter if he required general anesthesia \nfor an operation. \nDr. Dershwitz testified that the dose of thiopental which is \nadministered, 5 grams, has a very long lasting effect.  Thus, the likelihood \nthat the inmate will still be conscious when the other drugs are \nadministered is highly unlikely.  However, Dr. Dershwitz admitted that he \nhas never administered 5 grams of thiopental.  Furthermore, the usual \nsafeguards that Dr. Dershwitz uses in the operating room, which are \ndesigned to make certain the patient is fully anesthetized and not suffering, \nare absent in lethal injection.  These include:  pulse oximeter, end tidal \n‐ 20 ‐ \n\ncarbon dioxide monitor, muscle twitch measurement, and physician \nexamination of the “patient” under anesthesia. \nWhile “the ever‐present possibility of human error or accident is \ninsufficient to establish a constitutional violation,” this is not the standard \nby which medical procedures are judged.  Since lethal injection is proposed \nas a medical procedure, a medical doctor is employed by the state to \nperform it, and medical experts testify as to its efficacy, the procedure must \ntherefore meet the medical standard for safety, which is “medical standard \nof care.”  Medical standard of care is roughly defined as what a reasonable \nphysician would do in a given clinical situation.  The lethal injection \nprotocol in Missouri does not meet the medical standard of care because: \nThe thiopental, which comes as a powder, is mixed and infused by \nsomeone with no specific training in sedation or anesthesia.  Hospitals \ntypically have a “credentialing process” for persons using anesthesia drugs \nThe use of a femoral central venous line in a person who did not \nrequire it clearly violates the medical standard of care.  A patient/plaintiff \nin whom a femoral venous line was placed in this circumstance could \n‐ 21 ‐ \n\nreasonably be expected to collect monetary damages for unnecessary \nsurgery and pain and suffering.  \nThe chemicals are pushed by someone with no training in anesthesia, \nwho infuses the drugs through a long extension tubing and cannot actually \nmonitor the inmate.  The monitoring devices that safeguard anesthesia are \nnot present.  There is no formal record of monitoring, it no “anesthesia \nrecord” or the procedure.  Thus there is no way to look back retrospectively \nat any execution to identify issues that may have cause suffering.  Despite \nthe lack of formal records, 22 botched lethal injections have been \ndocumented, including 12 cases in which there were problems with IV \naccess and 3 cases of “unusual” reactions to drugs. \nThe judgment of the district court must be reversed. \n‐ 22 ‐ \n\nConclusion \nWHEREFORE, the petitioner prays the Court for its order that the \ndenial of his action under the foregoing circumstances be reversed, and the \ncause remanded with instructions that it be reassigned to the regularly \nselected district judge and that it proceed as it had been on January 28, \n2006. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON \n2683 South Big Bend Blvd., Suite 12 \nSt. Louis, Missouri 63143‐2100 \n

nificant facts relevant to that hearing. \nPursuant to this court’s order of Sunday, January 29, 2006, the district court \nattempted to conduct a hearing on the merits of this matter on Monday, January 30, \n2006 and Tuesday, January 31, 2006.  The court began proceedings with a telephone \nconference at 10:00 a.m.  This was approximately two hours after counsel for plaintiff \nlearned of the order; he had been traveling on January 29, 2006 and did not check his e‐\nmail until that morning.  During the conference, the court expressed some concern \nabout the logistics of such a rapid hearing.  While the court concluded that it could \nconduct a fair hearing within the confines of the time provided by this court, the court \nallowed with the defendants’ acquiescence, the intervenor to withdraw.  The \nintervenor’s motion to dismiss stated, as cause for the dismissal: \nBased on their evaluation of their ability to present \nadequately Mr. Clay’s claims in the hearing contemplated by \nthe court, Mr. Clay’s counsel do not believe that his interests \nwill be served by further participation in this case.  He \ncannot fairly present his claims and evidence to the court in \nthe limited time allowed for the hearing in this matter.  Since \nhe is not under execution warrant, he has no need to limit \nhis presentation based on the constraints on Mr. Taylor.  His \ninterests are now divergent from those of Mr. Taylor, and he \nwill be prejudiced if he is required to continue as a party to \nthis action. \nMotion To Dismiss Action Without Prejudice As To Intervenor, Dist. Ct. Doc. 71. \n \n\nBy granting this motion, both the court and the defendants implicitly conceded \nthat a fair hearing was impossible.  Further developments made that even clearer.  At \nthe initial telephone conference, the district court denied the plaintiffs the right to call \nthe doctor and nurse who have participated in multiple executions pursuant to the \nprotocol proposed by the state in this case.  At issue in this case is whether this protocol \nresults in unnecessary and excessive pain and suffering.  While not dispositive, it is at \nleast relevant to this issue whether the medical professionals who conduct the execution \nare alert to the possibility of such pain and suffering during the procedure.  It is also \nrelevant whether they have observed symptoms in executed persons which indicate \nthat these persons are suffering discomfort during the procedure.  Plaintiff was unable \nto present this evidence because of the court’s peremptory ruling excluding it.  Nor was \nthe plaintiff able to determine whether the qualifications of the medical professionals \ninvolved were in fact as the defendant Crawford said they were, because the court \nrefused to provide the plaintiff with the identity of the medical professionals.  The court \nbelow, in the case of Timothy Johnston v. Larry Crawford et al., denied a writ of \nprohibition sought by the state and required that the identities be provided to \nJohnston’s counsel pursuant to a protective order.  Mr. Taylor did not even have the \nbenefit of that limited discovery before a final hearing on the merits of his case. \nIn addition to the inability to present evidence in support of his claim from \ncrucial fact witnesses, the short period provided by the court below and its specially \nassigned judge prevented Mr. Taylor from presenting evidence from Dr. Sri Melethil, \n \n\nPh.D., J.D., a pharmacokineticist.  Dr. Melethil had previously consulted with counsel \nfor the plaintiffs’ team and expressed concern about the data on which the opinions of \nDr. Mark Dershwitz, the state’s expert, were based.  In particular, Dr. Melethil is aware \nthat the rate at which sodium thiopental leaves the brain is greater than that at which it \nleaves the blood.  Dr. Dershwitz’s conclusions were based on blood levels, but it is the \nbrain level which determines whether anesthesia has occurred.  Dr. Melethil was out of \ntown and out of touch until the morning of January 31, 2006.  Because complete \ndiscovery had not been obtained from Dr. Dershwitz, and because of Dr. Melethil’s \nprevious commitments, counsel for Mr. Taylor were unable to provide him with the \ndata he needed to form an expert opinion in this matter.   \nTaylor’s counsel filed a notice of appeal promptly on receipt of the judgment of \nthe district court.  On appeal, the foregoing issues will be presented, as well as the \nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s judgment and the propriety of \nconducting a hearing on the merits of a claim on substantially less than twenty‐four \nhours notice.  The state petitioners make much of the fact that the action has been on file \nsince June 2005.  Much of that time has been consumed with discovery disputes and the \nlitigation of a motion to dismiss, which the district judge whom the court below chose \nto replace had denied on December 28, 2005.  These state officials created all of the latter \ndelay; the undersigned is unaware of a day of delay attributable to the plaintiff. \nTwo business days after the regularly assigned district judge denied the state \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss, the Missouri Supreme Court issued its execution \n \n\nwarrant, before the state had even filed its answer in the district court case.  But even if \nfull discovery had been granted, it is highly irregular to set the final trial of a matter \nwithout even allowing a full working day for plaintiff’s counsel to prepare. \nPetitioner‐defendants present the idea of an appeal in this case as some form of \nabomination, when in fact it is the expectation of the legal system.  The court below has \nnever reached the merits of a lethal‐injection claim.  Petitioner‐defendants intend to \nkeep it that way by manipulating the judicial system to deny the most vulnerable of \ntheir citizens a day in court.  This Court has made clear in Nelson and in its disposition \nof stay applications over the past several days that that is not its position, especially \nwhere, as here, there is a precursor medical procedure involved which is unnecessary to \nbring about the “mere extinguishment of life,” and the only question is how much \nunnecessary pain it causes rather than whether it causes any at all. \nOn appeal, it is likely that the judgment of the district court will be overturned.  \nFirst, the exclusion of testimony from medical personnel who actually witness \nexecutions clearly violated Fed. R. Evid. 401.  While a district court’s rulings on \nexclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion, such abuse occurs when the \ncourt bases “its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous \nassessment of the evidence.”  Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990), \ncited in Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d 624 (6th Cir. 2004).  Under Fed. R. Evid. 401, “’relevant \nevidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is \nof consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable  than \n \n\nit would be without the evidence.”  Here, the issue is whether the mode of execution \nemployed by the State of Missouri causes unconstitutional pain and suffering.  To hold \nthat testimony by medical personnel (trained observers of symptoms) who actually \nparticipate in the execution is irrelevant to this determination flies in the face of the \nexpansive language of Rule 401.  In Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d 624 (6th Cir. 2004), the court \nreversed the judgment on the grounds that the trial court improperly excluded both \nexpert evidence bearing on a contested issue, and a letter which the court held “would \nclearly support one of the plaintiffsʹ main theories of the case.”  Beck v. Haik, 377 F.3d at \n637‐38.  The court held that the cumulative effect of these errors was prejudicial, and \nreversed the judgment. \nThis case is also similar to Riordan v. Kempiners, 831 F.2d 690, 697 (7th Cir. 1987), \nwhere the judgment was reversed after the trial court sustained the defendants’ motions \nin limine and excluded much of the plaintiff’s evidence.  The court noted, “[A]s the \njudge’s discretion was exercised on a wholesale basis before trial began, rather than in \nresponse to the developing course of the trial, careful appellate review is necessary to \nmake sure the judge did not truncate the trial prematurely.”  Since the state in this case \npresented no evidence as to the lack of pain and suffering during the execution process, \nand presented no witnesses who had personally observed the process in Missouri, the \nplaintiff’s lack of opportunity to explore this area is even more serious. \nSecond, the lack of notice of the hearing also deprived the plaintiff of the ability \nto prove his claim.  The situation, while somewhat unique, is similar to the denial of a \n \n\ncontinuance, and can be examined using the same standards.  At the close of the \nhearing, plaintiff’s counsel attempted to make an offer of proof to the court of the \ninformation he was seeking from his expert, Dr. Melethil, but could not do so because of \nthe time‐pressure created by the January 29, 2006, order of the court below and Dr. \nMelethil’s absence from the state.  Because this expert has not yet been able to obtain \nthis data, he is unable to be more specific about his opinion.  It should be noted, \nhowever, that Dr. Dershwitz did not testify concerning this data, although his testimony \nwas presented in support of the defendants’ case. \nHistory of the Case \nSince Timothy Johnston filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in August 2004, \nMissouri prisoners under sentence of death have been attempting to litigate claims that \nthe state’s method of conducting lethal injections violates the Eighth Amendment and \nother federal constitutional provisions.  Agents of the State of Missouri have \nmanipulated the judicial process to avoid any resolution on the merits by delaying \ndiscovery and other information until the Missouri Supreme Court had set an execution \ndate.  These state agents have then gotten the plaintiffs’ claims denied on the basis of \ndefenses other than the merits of their case or in a hearing for which the plaintiff’s \ncounsel was unable to marshal their evidence because of the late disclosure of the state’s \nposition. \nPlaintiff Taylor filed this action on June 3, 2005.  At that time, he was within the \nninety days in which he could seek certiorari after the Missouri Supreme Court denied \n \n\nhis motion to recall the mandate touching his conviction and sentence.  He filed a timely \npetition for writ of certiorari, which was not denied until November 28, 2005. \nIn this case, the parties have litigated for months over discovery issues.  When \nthe defendants sprang radically new information about their execution practices on \nTimothy Johnson’s counsel a week after the Missouri Supreme Court had set an \nexecution date, counsel in this case incorporated this information into an amended \ncomplaint (Attachment 1):  in order to attempt to avoid some of the constitutional \ninfirmities in the way everyone had thought Missouri lethal injections had proceeded, \nthe defendants introduced new constitutional violations including a central‐line access \nwhen it is not medically indicated and a violation of the Hippocratic Oath and AMA \nCode of Ethics when the state is supposed to be enforcing rather than violating medical \nethics.  Defendants’ counsel filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \n(Attachment 2)  Plaintiffs filed a response, and the defendants filed a reply. \nOn December 28, 2005, the district court issued an order rejecting the defenses \nthe defendants had raised in their motion to dismiss, and holding that the case \npresented factual issues which had to be resolved in a hearing or, at least, on summary \njudgment.  (Attachment 3.)  The undersigned counsel for Michael Taylor was out‐of‐\nstate for Christmas with his family on the day the district court issued this order.  The \nvery next day, he faxed a copy of the order, with a cover letter, to Bill Thompson, Staff \nAttorney (a/k/a Death Clerk), at the Missouri Supreme Court.  (Attachment 4.) \nOn January 3, 2006—the second business day after the undersigned counsel for \nMichael Taylor faxed the Missouri Supreme Court a copy of this district court’s order \n \n\nholding that the action needed to go forward—the Missouri Supreme Court set a \nFebruary 1, 2006, execution date. \nThe next day, counsel filed an application for stay of execution with the Missouri \nSupreme Court, attaching a copy of the district court’s order.  (Attachment 5.)  Several \ndays later, counsel received a response from the defendants’ co‐counsel.  (Attachment \n6.)  The next day, January 13, 2005, the undersigned counsel for Michael Taylor filed a \nreply.  (Attachment 7.) \nIn a telephone conference beginning at 9:51 a.m. on Wednesday, January 18, \n2006, the district court informed counsel for all parties that it would set an evidentiary \nhearing in this matter for February 21, 2006, with the hearing to extend to February 22, \n2006, should the district court need a second day to complete taking the evidence in the \nmatter.  Counsel were informed that the district court had attempted to schedule the \nhearing in time to decide the case before February 1, 2006, but that it would have been \nimpossible to do so.  Counsel for the defendants presented neither argument or \nevidence against the district court’s entering the order under discussion, but instead \ninformed the district court that they would seek to overturn any order that their clients’ \nexecution of plaintiff Taylor not proceed according to their schedule. \nAt 10:34 on January 18, the undersigned counsel for Michael Taylor faxed to the \nMissouri Supreme Court a supplemental notice in support of his pending application \nfor a stay from that court.  (Attachment 8.)  In a subsequent fax to that court, he \nrequested a call on his cellular phone if the clerk had any information to convey in the \nmatter.  (Attachment 9.)  By the end of the afternoon, he had received no response.  \nOnly after giving the Missouri Supreme Court an opportunity to stay its ordered \n \n\nexecution or to vacate its execution warrant without prejudice to setting another \nexecution date if the district court ruled against the plaintiffs. \nThroughout this litigation and the previous litigation over the Missouri lethal \ninjection procedure, the defendants have asserted in pleadings and affidavits or \ndeclarations, and admitted in the discovery they have chosen to respond to, that they \nuse the three‐chemical sequence to which the original complaint was directed and that \nthey also use a central‐line access and a licensed physician, to which the amended \ncomplaint was also directed.  (E.g., Application to Vacate [filed by defendants in this \nCourt January 20, 2006] Exhibit F at 1‐2 (no change from procedure and practices used \nto execute Timothy Johnston planned for executions of these plaintiffs) & 6‐7 (use of \ncentral‐line access and licensed physician).) \nThe same day that the district court entered its order requiring the defendants \nnot to execute plaintiff Taylor until further order of the court, with any such order to be \nissued within a reasonable time after the hearing on February 21 or February 21‐22, the \ndefendants filed a notice of appeal to this Court.  (Attachment 10.)  On Friday, January \n20, 2006, they faxed the Eighth Circuit an “application” to vacate the district court’s \npreliminary injunction. \nOn Sunday, January 29, 2006, a panel of the Eighth Circuit issued an order \nvacating the district judge’s preliminary injunction, a panel of the Eighth Circuit \nordered that the Chief Judge of the district court reassign the section 1983 action to \nanother district judge, and that the latter district judge conduct a hearing immediately \nand render judgment by noon on Wednesday, February 1, 2006.  It issued a stay of \nexecution through 11:59 p.m. on Friday, February 3, 2006. \n \n\nRespondents, represented by the hundreds of attorneys in the Office of the \nAttorney General, have both conducted their end of the immediate “hearing,” which \nwas entirely by telephone and excluded over objection several witnesses that the \npetitioner’s counsel sought to present, and filed an application to vacate the three‐day \nstay by the Eighth Circuit.  Because the Eighth Circuit truncated the section 1983 action \nbeyond recognition, the plaintiff‐intervenor dismissed without prejudice and the \nintervenor‐application withdrew his application to intervene, leaving the undersigned \nsole practitioner to handle the immediate hearing in the truncated section 1983 action \nalone.  He has been unable to seek relief from the Eighth Circuit’s defenestration of the \nexperienced district judge who had denied the motion to dismiss and had scheduled a \nhearing for February 21.  See Declaration in Support of Supplemental Suggestions in \nOpposition to Motion to Vacate Stay of Execution filed yesterday at 6:25 p.m. EST. \nDiscussion \nI.  Under the applicable standard of review, Taylor was entitled to have the \nEighth Circuit uphold the preliminary injunction which the district court \nentered in order to allow it to hear the case adequately; a fortiori, the pending \napplication to vacate any stay at all should be denied. \nIn reliance on the defense which is before this Court on certiorari in Hill v. Crosby, \nNo. 05‐8794, the state petitioners here argue that the standard of review is the same as it \nwould be if Taylor had filed a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition.  \nApplication at 5‐6.  Nothing could be further from the truth. \nA district court’s decision to order parties to maintain the status quo in order to \ngive it a chance to decide a matter within its jurisdiction is reviewable only for abuse of \ndiscretion.  Bell v. Sellevold, 713 F.2d 1396, 1399 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1070 \n(1984).  The standard of review of a district court’s entry of a preliminary injunction is \n \n\nabuse of discretion.  Ashcroft v. Amer. Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. 656, 664 (2004).  In \nEmerson Elec. Co. v. Rogers, 418 F.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit \nexplained:  “A district court has broad discretion when ruling on preliminary injunction \nrequests, and we will reverse only for clearly erroneous factual determinations, an error \nof law, or an abuse of discretion.  United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1179 \n(8th Cir.1998).”  It has amplified on this standard of review, collecting cases, in Aaron v. \nTarget Corp., 357 F.3d 768, 773‐74 (8th Cir. 2004): \n  A district court has broad discretion when ruling on a request for \npreliminary injunction, and it will be reversed only for clearly erroneous \nfactual determinations, an error of law, or an abuse of its discretion.  \nUnited Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1179 (8th Cir.1998).  . . .  \nThe abuse of discretion standard means that a court has a “range of \nchoice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within \nthat range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.”  Verizon \nCommunications, Inc. v. Inverizon Intʹl, Inc., 295 F.3d 870, 873 (8th Cir.2002) \n(citing Kern v. TXO Prod. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir.1984)).  An abuse \nof discretion occurs if a relevant factor that should have been given \nsignificant weight is not considered, if an irrelevant or improper factor is \nconsidered and given significant weight, or if a court commits a clear error \nof judgment in the course of weighing proper factors.  Id. \nBecause appellate review of a district court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction \nis only for abuse of discretion, an appellate could which might have handled the matter \ndifferently in the first instance “should uphold the injunction” and remand for a \nhearing on the merits even ‘[i]f the underlying constitutional question is close.’”  \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region, Inc. v. Nixon, 428 \nF.3d 1139, 1145 (8th Cir. 2004), quoting Ashcroft v. Amer. Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. at \n664‐65. \nThe only way the petitioner state officials could possibly justify the use of the \nstandard of review they advocate is by persuading the Court of their longstanding \nargument that this action is “really” a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 rather an action \n \n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  But the district courts’ order—which the defendants and their \nprivies made necessary by seeking and setting an execution date while the case was \npending—did not turn this section 1983 complaint into a successive section 2254 \npetition. \nDefendants attempt to shoehorn the district court’s preliminary injunction into \n28 U.S.C. § 2254 by arguing that the district court did not specify by what means the \ndefendants could not execute plaintiff Taylor.  (AVDCOPE:4‐5.)1  They argue that \nbecause the district court forbade them to execute plaintiff Taylor until after its hearing \nin the case without specifying that the execution would be the kind of execution which \nthey have pleaded and given affidavits that they would use, the whole action ceased to \nbe a civil case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and became, instead, a petition under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2254.  That makes no sense, but if it were accepted, the plaintiff could not have \nbrought the action in the first place based on the district court’s response, seven months \nlater, to the defendants’ privy’s setting an execution date immediately after the district \ncourt denied a motion to dismiss. \nDefendants could have raised this objection in the district court, either in the \ntelephone conference in which all counsel were informed of the district court’s hearing \non February 21, or in response to the district court’s solicitation the defendants’ \ncounsel’s review of the order the district court intended to issue.  The court’s \ninformation was clear that it was not attempting to fine‐tune the state’s execution plans \n                                                 \n1\nThe state officials (petitioners here, defendants in the district court) make mostly \nthe same arguments in this Court for vacating the Eighth Circuit’s stay that they made \nfor vacating the district court’s preliminary injunction.  Taylor cites to their pleading in \nthe Eighth Circuit by its initials, “AVDCOPE.” \n \n\nwithout the benefit of a hearing, and the court indicated that the defendants’ counsel \nshould advise it of any problem they had with the order it directed plaintiff Taylor’s \ncounsel to draft.  He, in turn, e‐mailed the draft to counsel for the defendants hours \nbefore the district court entered its order.  If the defendants thought the order swept \nbeyond the section 1983 action in which the district court issued it, they should have \nbrought this to the attention of the district court rather than sandbagging in the hope \nthat some other body would buy their theory that a court’s action in response to the \naction by their privy, the Missouri Supreme Court, would recast the entire litigation in \norder to bring about its dismissal. \nThe district court’s order makes clear that the order became necessary to resolve \nthe merits of the “pending” litigation, not some other litigation that it was creating in \nspite of the plaintiffs’ care in pleading their case under section 1983 rather than under \nsection 2254.  Plaintiffs are the masters of the action at this level, and have never sought, \nin this action, relief from their convictions and sentences—or even from execution by \nlethal injection per se—but only from a form of lethal injection which violates the \nConstitution of the United States.  Not only did the district court make its decision \nwithin the context of the action the plaintiffs filed—not the action the defendants wish \nthe plaintiffs had filed—but it could not denature that action if it had tried. \nIn the context of this case and of the need for preliminary injunctive relief to hold \na hearing on the merits, it would have made no sense to have requested, or ordered, \npreliminary injunctive relief other than the defendants’ simply refraining from \nexecuting plaintiff Taylor until after the hearing, scheduled for only a few weeks after \nthe district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss and only three weeks after the \n \n\nexecution date the Missouri Supreme Court set after it had been notified of the \ndismissal.  The alternative would have been for the district court to have ordered the \ndefendants not to execute him using the three‐chemical sequence, the central‐line \naccess, and the licensed physician.  Defendants have repeatedly filed pleadings and \naffidavits and—when they got around to it—discovery responses, indicating that they \nintend to perform all executions in this manner.  (E.g., Exhibit F at 1‐2 & 6‐7, supra.)  It \nwould require a hearing to establish that any new form of lethal injection the district \ncourt might have ordered rather than simply telling them to hold off on the execution \nuntil it could conduct a hearing.  If the district court could have held a hearing by \nFebruary 1, 2006, it would have held the one it has scheduled for February 21.  Given \nthe defendants’ unconstitutional response to critiques of their former botched \nexecutions, they would most likely have come up with some other alternative to the \nthree‐chemical sequence, central‐line access, and licensed physician which would have \nbeen even worse that the status quo from a constitutional and treaty point of view.  A \nfederal court order to come up with a new form of lethal injection would actually have \nbeen intrusive into the defendants’ activities—whereas corrections personnel in death‐\npenalty states know, going in, that there will be times when courts or executives tell \nthem to keep an execution on hold:  obeying such orders is part of their expected duties, \nwhereas changing execution protocols and procedures and the substance of the lethal \nacts themselves at the last minute would be highly unusual.  Such an order would not \nhave respected the rights and responsibilities of either the plaintiffs or the defendants, \nand no one should be criticized for the fact that the district court’s order proceeded on \nthe more parsimonious path. \n \n\nIn this respect, the defendants are attempting to relitigate the denial of their \nmotion to dismiss about the nature of the action ab initio.  It would stand the judicial \nprocess on its head to hold that after they have lost on a motion in which they argued \nthat this litigation was “really” a federal habeas corpus action, any court would agree \nwith them because the district court took a modest, limited action which it found \nnecessary to resolve the case on the merits. \nAlthough the plaintiffs do not regard the district court’s order as overbroad, if \nthis Court were to disagree, the remedy would be to remand with instructions rather \nthan to reach back in time and grant, at the appellate level, the motion to dismiss insofar \nas it pleaded the case was “really” a successive federal habeas corpus action.  See, e.g., \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region, Inc. v. Nixon, 428 \nF.3d at 1145‐46.  Defendants and their privies should not be allowed to take an \ninterlocutory appeal on the motion to dismiss by setting an execution date in order to \nforce the district court to issue preliminary relief.  They do not like the fact that they are \nlosing in the district court, and by setting an execution date after it denied the \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss but before the district court can adjudicate the case on its \nmerits, they are attempting an illegitimate end run. \nAlthough the Court should reject the defendants’ attempt to denature this 1983 \naction on grounds common to all litigation, in this special area it bears remarking that \nthe plaintiffs could not have raised lethal injection claims in their habeas corpus \npetitions.  Defendants have not disclosed their modus operandi until the discovery in \nthe Timothy Johnston case—even then, only weeks after the district court issued an \norder compelling discovery and, to a large extent, after their privies in the Missouri \n \n\nSupreme Court had set an execution date.  That court has held a Missouri prisoner \ncannot litigate claims regarding lethal injection methods and personnel in the forms of \nstate‐court litigation which would be a prerequisite for raising such claims under \nsection 2254.  In Worthington v. State, 166 S.W.3d 566, 583 n.3 (Mo. 2005) (en banc), a \nMissouri condemned person attempted to raise such a claim in his state post‐conviction \nrelief appeal; the state court which sets execution dates held the challenge premature: \n  As it is unknown what method, if any, of lethal injection may be \nutilized by the State of Missouri at such future time, if any, as Mr. \nWorthingtonʹs right to seek relief in state and federal courts is concluded \nand his execution date and method are set, it is premature for this Court to \nconsider whether a particular method of lethal injection violates the \nEighth Amendment because it causes lingering, conscious infliction of \nunnecessary pain. \nNot only would the plaintiffs have had no opportunity to raise these claims in \nthe state courts, but at the time they filed their habeas corpus petitions there would be \nno way of saying what the state’s practices for lethal injection would be.  Defendants \nand their privies have shown time and again that they will not disclose a syllable that \nwould support even a doubt about the efficacy of their procedures and personnel for \nbringing about a speedy, painless death unless they are under the gun of a federal court \nand opposing counsel is laboring under an execution warrant, and only then, when \nbroad areas of their belated responses are subject to gag orders which hobble the \nplaintiffs’ counsel in preparation for hearings.  Only through offensive affidavits which \nthe defendants submitted in the Timothy Johnston case did these plaintiffs’ counsel \nlearn that the state uses central‐line access via the femoral vein, and a licensed \nphysician.  These facts are key elements of two of the plaintiffs’s causes of action.  They \nappear to be reactions to botched executions which occurred after or at about the same \ntime that the plaintiffs’ habeas corpus petitions were due; they did not exist within the \n \n\nlimitations period for a section 2254 petition, yet the defendants say they are the \nrelevant facts for these plaintiffs’ projected executions. \nUnless this Court wishes to make the novel holding that there is no legal or \nequitable remedy of any kind for a specific execution procedure which violates the \nEighth Amendment and other constitutional guaranties, therefore, it follows that \nbecause habeas corpus cannot provide a remedy, section 1983 does. \nII.  Plaintiffs do not challenge lethal injection broadly, but only a narrow \nband of behavior analogous to the “cut‐down” procedure at issue in Nelson v. \nCampbell and authoritatively held to sound in section 1983. \nWhat the defendants say they are going to do to the plaintiffs subjects the \ncondemned person to a femoral central line access—an invasive and painful and \ncomplicated precursor to execution that is not medically accepted as the first form of IV \naccess.  What Missouri does is as invasive as what the Alabama defendants wanted to \ndo to Mr. Nelson—but with less justification, as Mr. Nelson had a bona fide venous‐\naccess issue, whereas these Missouri defendants have decided that all condemned \npersons, regardless of their health, will be subjected to the femoral central‐line surgical \nprocedure as a precursor to execution. \n \n\nIII.  The district court’s order acted within its discretion in holding that the \nDataphase standard supported the limited preliminary relief which it granted. \nA.  Defendants’ assertion that the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on the \nmerits is an attempt to circumvent the district court’s denial of their motion to \ndismiss, which pleaded the same premises, and on which the district court found \nit necessary to set a hearing. \n1.  Defendants are estopped to argue unlikelihood of prevailing on the \nmerits in light of the fact that they have litigated and lost on their motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim. \nState official petitioners (defendants in the district court) cite numerous cases \nupholding lethal injection generally or the three‐chemical sequence on a variety of \nfactual arrays as if they somehow doom Taylor’s claim as a matter of law.  Nothing \ncould be further from the truth, as the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss \nand the grudging admission by the court below that some semblance of a hearing was \nnecessary.  Petitioner‐defendants cite no case involving a femoral line access.  That is a \nprecursor operation, without medical necessity except in the case of lifelong \nintravenous drug abusers without an adequate venous system, which makes this case \nlike Nelson v. Campbell and unlike the plain‐vanilla three‐chemical cases on which the \nstate relies for its headnote law. \nFrom the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the district court was well aware of the \nhistory of their treatment of Timothy Johnston’s constitutional grievances.  That is \nundoubtedly one reason it denied the motion to dismiss, scheduled a hearing, and \nissued a preliminary injunction to permit the hearing to proceed. \n \n\nDefendants’ reliance on the courts’ actions in the Timothy Johnston case is \nunsound because this Court did not reach the merits of that plaintiff’s claims and the \nstay was issued over the district court’s refusal to grant such relief rather than at the \ndistrict court’s instance.  Defendants rely, as well, on a grant of summary judgment \nagainst plaintiff Timothy Johnston for their assertion that their method of lethal \ninjections is constitutional.  (AVDCOPE:8.)  In that case, their counsel withheld \ndiscovery in the face of an order compelling it until the Missouri Supreme Court had set \nan execution date, then sprang new data on Mr. Johnston’s counsel and filed motions \nfor summary judgment and for an expedited hearing.  Defendants did not complete \ntheir responses to discovery until this Court denied rehearing on the denial of their \npetition for a writ of prohibition to keep the district court from requiring them to \nprovide the discovery they had agreed to provide subject to a protective order before \nthe Missouri Supreme Court set an execution date.  Mr. Johnston’s counsel was forced \nto litigate the case with one and a half hands tied behind their backs.  It should come as \nno surprise that they received an adverse holding. \nThere is no reason why the district court in this case should have deferred to \nanother district court holding rendered under the circumstances of the Johnston holding, \ninstead of setting the case for a hearing at which the defendants would not enjoy the \nelement of surprise which they created by defying a sister court’s order until their \nprivies in the Missouri Supreme Court had set an execution date. \nDefendants protestations that the sodium pentothal couldn’t possibly fail to \nanesthetize the condemned person throughout the execution are belied by their \n \n\ninsistence on using pancuronium bromide to mask the symptoms of inadequate or \ninefficient administration of sodium pentothal. \n2.  Defendants have failed to show that the state’s use of a licensed \nphysician in violation of medical ethics is constitutionally permissible when the state \nhas undertaken to enforce medical ethics. \nIn an attempt to obviate the constitutional deficiencies in their lethal‐injection \nprocedure, the defendants have committed yet another constitutional violation.  In their \napplication to proceed with an execution before the district court can take evidence on \nthis issue, they make various legal arguments and some amateur medical‐ethics \narguments.  Far from making it appear that the plaintiff has no likelihood of succeeding \non the merits, the defendants’ arguments are practically contradictory in typical “guilty \nclient” fashion—for example, that a physician can care for a person and kill them at the \nsame time (AVDCOPE:14), and that if this were a prison disciplinary proceeding, the \nplaintiff would have to show “atypical and significant hardship,” whereas being \nexecuted by a physician is neither atypical nor a hardship (AVDCOPE:15‐16).  Stating \nwhat one does not know (AVDCOPE:14) about medical ethics does not demonstrate \nthat one’s opponent is unlikely to succeed on the merits if one can’t kill the opponent \nbefore he gets a hearing. \n3.  Defendants attempt to recycle the same arguments they used, without \neffect, in their motion to dismiss to the effect that the use of an unnecessarily painful \nform of execution is not a badge of slavery. \nOnce more, the defendants attempt to use the pending “application” as an end \nrun around the district court’s denial of their motion to dismiss. \n \n\nIn this action, the plaintiffs do not claim that the death penalty is a badge of \nslavery—only that the use of a form of execution which causes unnecessary pain and \nsuffering is a badge of slavery.  Defendants to not question the historical evidence the \ndefendants submitted with their original and amended complaints, but argue that if a \npractice isn’t a carbon copy of chattel slavery, the plaintiffs have no likelihood of \nprevailing on the merits.  That is why we have hearings.  The only question is whether \nthis one will go on when the lead plaintiff is six feet under. \nB.  Defendants beg the question of irreparable harm to plaintiff Taylor by \nasserting the very propositions of fact and law on which they have lost in the \ndenial of their motion to dismiss and on which the district court has set a hearing \nfor February 21. \nDefendants cannot seriously contend that being put to death by a means society \ndoes not tolerate for euthanizing animals would be an “irreparable injury.”  Because \nthey cannot bring themselves to acknowledge any claim that would cast doubt on their \nactions, they attempt to meet this point in the Dataphase analysis by asserting that their \ncase is so strong on the merits that an execution by their chosen means couldn’t possibly \nwork an irreparable harm on anyone.  That would have been a good argument if the \ndistrict court had agreed with their motion to dismiss; it is another attempt at an end \nrun in light of the district court’s rejection of it. \nOur law is repelled by the notion of hanging in the morning and trying in the \nafternoon.  In light of the fact that the plaintiffs have prevailed on the motion to dismiss, \nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing an order that they may present \n \n\ntheir case before one of them is rendered unable to proceed with the case because the \nvery means he challenged in it have been used to kill him. \nC.  Defendants fail to establish that “the harm to other interested parties if \nthe relief is granted” rises to the level to make the district court’s decision an \nabuse of discretion. \nDefendants assert that the decedent’s family will suffer harm if plaintiff Taylor is \nexecuted on February 22 or March 1 rather than February 1.  (AVDCOPE:18 (talismanic \ninvocation of “closure”).)  Assuming the defendant’s suppressed and dubious premise \nthat the decedent’s want plaintiff Taylor executed at all, the defendants do not suggest \nthat the decedent’s family wants him executed in a manner that will create unnecessary \npain and suffering.  There is no difference in principle between allowing the district \ncourt the minimal amount of time it found that it needs to conduct a hearing on the \naction filed June 3, 2006, and forbidding the defendants to execute plaintiff Taylor in a \nway the district court had already found to be unconstitutional.  If denying condemned \npersons a day in court were an acceptable price for “closure,” then no constitutional \nrights of persons convicted of capital offenses (including those implicating their guilt of \nthe underlying offense) would be safe from the political branches. \n \n\nD.  Defendants’ vague allegations of “the effect on the public interest” of \nholding a hearing on their method of lethal injection before using in on a litigant \nwho filed his action months before they and their privies set an execution date \nless than a week after the district denied their motion to dismiss do not rise to the \nlevel to make the district court’s decision an abuse of discretion. \nDefendants attempt to inject the facts of the underlying offenses as if that \njustified their infliction of gratuitous pain and suffering on plaintiff Taylor.  \n(AVDCOPE:18 n.8.)  They would thereby have this Court sanction a reversal of \nthousands of years of progress in the criminal law.  Although the Supreme Court has \nallowed the states and the federal government to extract the “mere extinguishment of \nlife,” the presence of unsavory facts in the underlying case is no more a defense to using \nunnecessarily painful forms of execution than it would be to denying trials altogether \nbecause the condemned person did not give the decedent a fair trial. \nBoilerplate about the state’s interest in seeing that sentenced be carried out \nproves too much, in that this Court sees them even when there is absolutely no doubt \nthat an execution cannot go forward according to the executioners’ timetable.  In this \nprocedural context, the question is not whether there is absolutely no doubt, but only \nwhether the district court abused its discretion in granting the limited relief it granted. \nRecent months have seen a heightened awareness of the issue of torture.  In the \namended complaint, the plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of the district court in part on \nthe basis of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment, or Punishment—art. I, ¶ 1, of which defines “torture” as “any \nact by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \n \n\ninflicted on a person for such purposes as . . . punishing him for an act he or a third \nperson has committed or is suspected of having committed . . . or for any reason based \non discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the \ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person \nacting in an official capacity.” (Attachment 1 at 15‐16.)  Because the defendants’ use of a \nform of lethal injection which causes the certainty (at least in respect to the central‐line \nprocedure) or known risk of unnecessary pain and suffering is an official act done for \nthe purpose of punishment, it falls within the definition of “torture” which is most \nrelevant to assessing the harm to the public interest of denying plaintiff Taylor a day in \ncourt on his constitutional claims. \nIn the district court, the plaintiffs pleaded that the public interest militates \nheavily in favor of an adjudication on the merits of this claim, rather than on letting the \ndefendants avoid it by torturing the plaintiff to death under a chemical veil.  Plaintiffs’ \naction is absolutely neutral about the death penalty, and if the country wants to keep it \nfor the time being, it is most likely to do so if the boil with the habitual three‐chemical \nsequence is lanced in this action.  At the same time, it is not in the public interest for the \ncitizens of all but two lethal‐injection jurisdictions to be implicated in torture when the \nostensible purpose of lethal injection is to bring about the “mere extinguishment of life.”  \nThe place of the United States in an increasingly interdependent world—in which its \nmere practice of the death penalty has pro tanto alienated it from all but a few mostly \nrepressive, backward countries including two which our fathers (including the district \njudge who entered the order here challenged) have fought seriatim throughout the \nPacific and then in Korea.  It is reasonable to anticipate that when the LANCET article \n \n\n(Lubarsky Exhibit 2 to Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2) has had the effect in Western Europe that it \nought to have here, the United States will be substantially impaired in its ability to \nobtain extradition of those charged with crimes against the United States.  That, and not \nrespecting the prerogative of the district court to hold a hearing before signing off on \nyet another execution, is the appropriate focus of the public interest inquiry. \n \n\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, respondent Taylor prays the Court for \nits order that the pending application to vacate stay of execution be denied. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON \n \nOf Counsel  2683 South Big Bend Blvd. # 12 \nSindel, Sindel & Noble, P.C.  Saint Louis, Missouri  63143‐2100 \n \n(314) 645‐1776 —  FAX (314) 645‐2125 \n  simonj@sbcglobal.net \n \nAttorney for Petitioner \n \n\nI.

Campbell, \n541 U.S. 637 (2004); Dickerson v. Dotson, 125 S.Ct. 1242 (2005), Gregg v. \nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976); Furman v. Georgia.  408 U.S. 238, 273 \n(1972); Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463  (1947); In re \nKemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447  (1890); Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 136 (1878). \nThe constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishments in \nU.S. Const. amend. VIII, and the English Bill of Rights of 1688 forbids “the \nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.”  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 \n(1976) (plurality opinion)..  In addition to disproportionality to a given offense, it \n\nis the infliction of unnecessary or “wanton” pain in carrying out a death sentence \nwhich lies at the heart of the constitutional prohibition in capital cases.  Louisiana \nex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463  (1947) (plurality opinion); \nWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 136 (1878) (“unnecessary cruelty”).  One of the \ncharacteristics that marks a cruel and unusual execution is “a lingering death.”  In \nre Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447  (1890).  A punishment is particularly offensive to \nconstitutional norms if it involves the foreseeable infliction of suffering:  in \nLouisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, an electric chair had malfunctioned, and Mr. \nFrancis had not died at the appointed time; he contended that re-executing him \nwould be unconstitutional.  A divided Court rejected his claim, based in part on \nlack of mens rea by the state actors:  the plurality reasoned that if the failed \nexecution been intentional and not unforeseen, the second punishment would have \nbeen, like torture, “so degrading and indecent as to amount to a refusal to accord \nthe criminal human status”  The Court relied on this principle from Francis in its \nreasoning in Furman v. Georgia.  408 U.S. 238, 273 (1972). \nThese constitutional guaranties apply to lethal injections, and a cause of \naction exists for preventing the infliction of gratuitous pain and suffering under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, in cases of lethal injection, at least when they involve the use of a \nprecursor operation such as a “cut-down.”  Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 \n(2004).  Last week the Supreme Court issued a stay of execution in the Hill case to \n‐ 2 ‐ \n\nexamine whether such actions are, as the appellees argued below, “really” a second \nhabeas corpus.  Yesterday it granted a stay in the Rutherford case, which involved \nthat issue plus the question whether the plaintiff had waited too long to file the \nsection 1983 action. \nFor the reasons set forth in the plaintiff’s brief and application for a stay \ndirected to the panel, which counsel understands have been sent to every judge in \nactive service, the plaintiff is at the very least entitled to litigate an appeal from the \ndistrict court’s drumhead denial of relief.  Counsel would repeat those arguments \nhere but for the fact that the panel’s stay expires at 5:00 p.m. today, about an hour \nand a half from now. \nAs explained in those document, the State and its privies created the \nsituation in which the plaintiff is litigating this issue under this unconscionable \npressure.  They will continue to do so until this Court or the Supreme Court draws \na line in the sand.  What is at stake is not only human decency, but the \nindependence of the judiciary.  God save the United States and this Honorable \nCourt. \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\nWHEREFORE, the appellant prays the Court for its order as aforesaid. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON \n \nOf Counsel            2683 South Big Bend Blvd., Suite 12 \nSindel, Sindel & Noble, P.C.

itigate a snap \nhearing in a capital case involving several experts.  Simply procuring their \nparticipation by phone took substantial time and effort.  Counsel was not \nable to contact one of them, who had been out of town, until the morning of \nthe second day (yesterday), and he could not be ready to testify until the \nnext day, which the new district judge did not allow.  As a result of these \nunusual and irregular demands, the undersigned was unable to do the \nkind of job on this capital case involving arcane scientific subjects that he \nwould typically do on the least grave and sensitive matters in his practice. \nBecause he had to conduct a telephone hearing solo two days in a \nrow, the undersigned counsel was unable to prepare a pleading in this \nCourt to seek to have the very order requiring the hearing overturned, and \nhad to suspend my activities in support of execution clemency, which the \nsame court has authorized me to engage in under its appointment. \nDefendants sought to have the Supreme Court vacate this Court’s \npanel’s stay in its entirety.  That Court declined.  After the district judge \nissued the order, rendered inevitable by the circumstances under which the \n‐ 5 ‐ \n\nlawyers tasked to handle the hearing while the undersigned handled \nclemency advocacy, were removed by the technical knock‐out of December \n29, 2006, the defendants filed a motion before this Court to vacate its three‐\nday stay.  The undersigned did not receive this motion by e‐mail until \nseveral minutes before this Court acted on it (the second time he called the \nOffice of the Attorney General to request it, after learning from a call to this \nCourt that it had been filed); he did not receive it by fax at the number in \nhis letterhead (or any other fax number) until (according to the readout on \nhis fax machine) 9:26 p.m., or “21:26,” i.e., only three minutes before this \nCourt e‐mailed counsel its ruling on the motion. \nHaving received no response to the state’s motion (for the reason just \nspecified), the panel cut its stay back to 5:00 p.m. today.  Defendants were \nnot satisfied with that, and applied to the Supreme Court to vacate its stay \nin its entirety. \nAppellant interposes this motion in anticipation that either the \nSupreme Court will vacate the existing stay or it will take longer than \nseven hours and thirteen minutes to process his appeal. \n‐ 6 ‐ \n\nWHEREFORE, the appellant prays the Court for its order as \naforesaid. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON \n \nOf Counsel

Legal Standard\nIn  the  opening  brief,  corrections  officials  demonstrated  that  the  Eighth\nAmendment legal standard by which to measure a complaint concerning the method\nof execution was, as established by the Supreme Court, whether “the punishment\n[involved] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” (Appellant’s Brf., page 28\nquoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976)).  Officials also noted that\nTaylor did not demonstrate and the district court did not find “purpose,” “deliberate\nindifference,”  “maliciously  or  sadistically,”  or  any  other  mental  state  by  the\ncorrections officials (Appellant’s Brf., pages 35-38).  \nTaylor now contends that corrections officials did not raise this issue; thus, it\nis waived (Appellee’s Brf., page 51, 54, 59).  But corrections officials asserted that\nthe legal standard of review for the method-of-execution claim was that set forth in\nGregg.  They made that contention in the original appeal to this court (Appellee’s\nBrief in No. 06-1397 (8th Cir. March 17, 2006, page 27).  And they presented that\ncontention in various pleadings to the district court (App. 37, 104, 209-10, 360).  The\ndistrict court was aware of the proper Eighth Amendment standard, perhaps as best\nshown by its quotation of Gregg in its January 31, 2006 order (App. 139).  The\ndistrict court erred by failing to apply that standard.\nIn the opening brief, corrections officials demonstrated that neither the text of\nthe Eighth Amendment nor the Supreme Court decisions interpreting that text\nencompass a notion that the Eighth Amendment protects the condemned against a\n4\n\n“risk” of pain during an execution (Appellant’s Brf., pages 28-31).  Corrections\nofficials also demonstrated that the Eighth Amendment should not be expanded to\nencompass such a rule (Appellant’s Brf., pages 32-34).  Taylor offers no authority to\nthe contrary (see Appellee’s Brf., pages 52-53).  Instead, Taylor concludes that the\nprohibition  against  an  unnecessary  infliction  of  pain  is  the  same  thing  as  the\nunnecessary risk of pain (Appellee’s Brf., page 53).  But there is no Supreme Court\nauthority for that proposition (Appellee’s Brf., page 53) nor does Taylor offer\nanalysis in support of that assertion (Appellee’s Brf., page 53).  \nTaylor argues that many local courts apply the “risk” standard (Appellee’s\nBrf., pages 53-54).  Corrections officials acknowledged this in their opening brief, but\nalso demonstrated how the “risk” language traced its origins to preliminary injunction\nlitigation (Appellant’s Brf., page 31 citing Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029, 1030\n(9th Cir. 2004)).  More telling is the fact that Taylor refers the court to no Supreme\nCourt precedent holding that the Eighth Amendment is violated when a means of\nexecution involved a risk of pain (Appellee’s Brf., page 54).\nTaylor contends that the risk standard is necessary in order for the federal\ncourts to regulate the execution practices of several states (Appellee’s Brf., page 55).\nCorrections officials do not believe such regulation should be a goal, in and of itself.\nAnd as articulated in the opening brief, the Eighth Amendment was designed to\n5\n\nprohibit the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,”  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.\nat 173, not impose an assessment of risks.1\nIn the opening brief, corrections officials showed that the district court erred\nby failing to make a finding of scienter, a mental state, i.e. a finding that the\ncorrections officials have the purpose to add an element of cruelty to the execution.\nTaylor contends that the intent of the corrections officials is irrelevant (Appellee’s\nBrf., page 59) relying on Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 682 & n.12 (9th Cir. 1994).\nIn contrast to the Ninth Circuit’s Campbell decision, in whatever Eighth Amendment\ncontext a claim has arisen, the Supreme Court has required a showing of scienter.\nTaylor shows no wording to the contrary in the text of the Eighth Amendment and\nalso identifies no Supreme Court case construing the amendment that holds to the\ncontrary.  \nTaylor makes no argument that he can show that corrections officials act with\n“purpose” or “maliciously or sadistically” (Appellee’s Brf., pages 59-61).  Taylor\nsuggests that he may be able to show “deliberate indifference” (Appellee’s Brf., pages\n61 n.34).   To support that assertion, however, he only refers the court to pre-July, 14,\n2006  protocol  evidence  that  the  Department  remained  dependent  on  Dr.  Doe\n(Appellee’s Brf., page 61 n.34).  Of course, Taylor does not demonstrate any\n     1Of course, this is not to say that “risks” analysis has no place in the development\nof  social  policy  generally  or  the  use  of  capital  punishment  specifically.    The\nappropriate place for that analysis however, is with the policymakers of the several\nstates, not constitutional interpretation of the Eighth Amendment.\n6\n\n“deliberate indifference in the development and proposed implementation of the July\n14, 2006 protocol. \nII.  No Unreasonable Risk Exists\nAssuming the Eighth Amendment regulates “unreasonable risks,” no such risks\nexist.  In his first point, Taylor contends that the district court correctly found that the\nMissouri execution procedure violated the Eighth Amendment because it created a\nrisk of pain (Appellee’s Brf., page 26).  Initially, Taylor contends that the third\nchemical, potassium chloride, causes pain (Appellee’s Brf., page 29).  That is why it\nis the third chemical.  The first chemical injected was five grams of thiopental in a 60\ncc syringe (June Tr. 370) and with today’s written protocol, five grams is injected in\na 200 cc solution (Add. 32; §B.2).  Its purpose is to render the offender unconscious.\nTaylor  acknowledges  that  a  five  gram  dose  of  thiopental  “is  more  than\nsufficient to cause unconsciousness” (Appellee’s Brf., page 30 n.11).  But Taylor is\napparently afraid that he may not receive the five gram dose.  Id.  To support this fear,\nTaylor asserts that corrections officials abdicated authority to Dr. Doe (Appellee’s\nBrf., page 30).   Director Crawford is the person who has authority to set the method\nof execution within the dictates of Missouri law (June Tr. 363).  Upon learning of Dr.\nDoe’s previous changes in the amount of thiopental administered, the director\ntestified that he intended to issue a defined protocol so that this would not happen\nagain (June Tr. 369).   Director Crawford testified that an execution would begin with\nthe administration of five grams of thiopental (June Tr. 370).  Neither the chemicals\n7\n\nthemselves nor the order of the chemicals could be changed by anyone other than\nDirector Crawford (June Tr. 371).  \nIndependently, under the July 14, 2006 protocol, “the quantities of these\nchemicals may not be changed without prior approval of the department director”\n(Add. 32 (§B.1)).  The critical fact, the injection of five grams of thiopental into the\ncondemned, is not the subject of discretion by Dr. Doe, and Dr. Doe is so aware (June\nTr. 374; App. 731-33).  So even assuming that Dr. Doe were to continue as a\n“medical personnel” under the protocol (Add. 32 (§A.2, A.3)), five grams of the first\nchemical, thiopental will be administered.  \nTaylor contends that Dr. Doe is not competent to be involved with an execution\n(Appellee’s Brf., pages 32-33).  The written July 14, 2006 protocol provides that a\nvariety of medical personnel can prepare the chemicals used during the lethal\ninjection, insert intravenous lines, monitor the offender, and supervise the injection\nof lethal chemicals by non-medical members of the execution team (Add. 32 (§A.2,\nA.3)).  Assuming Dr. Doe were to participate, Taylor’s sole complaint is that he\ncannot adequately prepare thiopental (Appellee’s Brf., page 33).  But the difficulty\nDr. Doe had in mixing thiopental was the result of attempting to mix it at a high\nconcentration (App. 645-46, 672-75).  The July 14, 2006 protocol removes that\ndifficulty because the five grams of thiopental is administered in 200 ccs of solution\n(Add. 32 (§B.2)), which is the standard 2 ½% solution that can be prepared exactly\nas the manufacturer intended (App. 226, 1252).  The mixing is simple: one mixes the\n8\n\npowder that comes in a container with supplied dilutant (January 30 Tr. 14).  Taylor’s\narticulated concern is resolved by the written protocol.   \nThe third concern expressed by Taylor is that corrections officials have no\nconsistent procedure (Appellee’s Brf., pages 33-34).  But the sole basis for this\nconcern is the same as for the first concern: the authority of Dr. Doe.  That concern\nhas been discussed earlier.\nThe fourth articulated concern by Taylor is with the “drug delivery mechanism”\n(Appellee’s Brf., pages 34-35).  The district court made no finding that “the drug\ndelivery mechanism risked improper administration” (Appellee’s Brf., page 34).\nTaylor refers the court to Addendum 18 (Appellee’s Brf., page 34).  But that page is\na recitation of evidence heard by the district court, not a fact finding (Add. 18).\nTaylor also cites Addendum 21-22, but that finding by the district court was in the\ncontext of monitoring anesthetic depth (Concern 5, discussed below) and not a\nfinding about “drug delivery mechanism.”   Similarly, Taylor cites Addendum page\n23 as a fact finding by the district court.  It is not; instead, that page is the district\ncourt’s recitation of things it would like to see in a written protocol.   \nAnd Taylor’s criticism in his brief does not discuss the July 14, 2006 written\nprotocol.  Before an execution begins, saline solution is used to confirm that the IV\nlines are properly inserted and that the lines are not obstructed (Add. 33 (§C.2)).  The\noffender is monitored (Add. 33 (§D)).  The execution support room is lit (Add. 33\n(§E.1)).  After injection of the five grams of thiopental, medical personnel inspect the\ncatheter site (Add. 34 (§E.3)).  Before the remaining chemicals are administered,\n9\n\nmedical personnel confirm that the condemned is unconscious (Add. 34 (§E.4)).\nTaylor does not criticize the drug delivery mechanism contained in the written\nprotocol.  \nSimilarly, Taylor’s fifth concern, the lack of monitoring anesthetic depth, is\naddressed in the July 14, 2006 written protocol.  Taylor complains that the medical\npersonnel could not see the offender through the window between the execution\nsupport room and the execution room.   This concern is resolved by the repositioning\nof the condemned in the execution room so that he can be seen through the window\n(Appellee’s Brf., page 46).   The written protocol resolved these concerns to the\ndistrict court’s satisfaction (Add. 27).\nThe final concern articulated by Taylor is “the procedure as a whole.”  But risk,\nlike fractions, do not grow larger as they are considered cumulatively.  If one is going\nto be indoors 50% of the day and there is 50% chance of rain, the chance of getting\nwet is not 100%, but 25%.  If one brings an umbrella half the time, the odds of getting\nwet  fall  to  12½%.    And  so  on.    See  http://espse.ed.psu.edu/edpsych/\nfaculty/rhale/statistics/chapters/chapter7/chap7.html, pp. 4-5 (Multiplicative law of\nprobability) (lasted visited 1/5/07).    Taylor provided no quanification for any of the\nperceived risks.   And he can provide no quanification for the cumulative risk he now\nasserts existed.  \nIII.  Remedy\nA large portion of Taylor’s brief consists of claims that Missouri’s lethal\ninjection process is flawed.  Much of the criticism refers to the practice as it occurred\n10\n\nbefore it was formalized into a written protocol (Add. 32-35; App. 215-18), so, with\nregard to prospective relief at least, it has little, if any continuing relevance.\nEven the alleged flaws that existed before the process was set out in written\nform, however, do not render it inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Even when\nthe Department’s doctor had some difficulty preparing the thiopental, the condemned\nreceived at least 2.5 grams of this chemical (App. 647-53, 664-65, 672, 675).  The\ndoctor, based on his medical knowledge and experience, determined this amount was\nmore than sufficient to render the condemned prisoner deeply unconscious and unable\nto experience any pain (App. 627-28, 629, 676, 687).  Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Thomas\nHenthorn, testified that as little as 1.67 grams of thiopental will result in a deep state\nof unconsciousness in almost everyone (June Tr. 233, 241-42).  There is no evidence\nof any occasion in which Dr. Doe accidently gave an incorrect2 amount of thiopental\nto the condemned due to improper mixing.\nThe thrust of Taylor’s arguments with regard to alleged flaws of the written\nprotocol relate to whether there are assurances that the amount of thiopental intended\nto be administered to the condemned will actually be administered (Appellee’s Brf.,\npage 30 n.11).  But, as discussed in the corrections officials’ brief (Appellant’s Brf.,\npages 59-61), the written protocol provides ample assurance that the five grams of\nthiopental will actually be delivered to the condemned’s bloodstream.  \n     2Taylor takes issue with the use of the word “incorrect” at pages 32-33 of his brief,\non the ground that there were occasions that the condemned prisoner did not receive\nthe five grams of thiopental intended by corrections officials.  The corrections\nofficials, however use the word “incorrect” here to mean simply an amount of\nthiopental lower than that which would cause deep unconsciousness.\n11\n\nIn particular, the written protocol provides that, between the administration of\nthe first chemical (thiopental) and the second two chemicals, the medical person who\nset the IV line will return to the execution room and directly assess whether the\ncondemned is conscious (App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.3)).  Taylor, at page 46 of his brief,\ncriticizes this step on the ground that only a professional anesthesiologist can\nappropriately apply techniques for assessment of consciousness.  But doctors, nurses,\nand emergency medical technicians have the ability to assess level of consciousness\nto the extent that they can be confident that a person is sufficiently unconscious to be\nunaware of any pain that would normally be the result of noxious stimuli (App. 371B,\nparagraph 8).  This direct assessment of the condemned prisoner by the medical\nperson present will provide reasonable assurance that the condemned prisoner will\nbe unconscious when the second and third chemicals are administered.\nMoreover, the protocol provides that the medical person present will examine\nthe IV catheter site following the administration of the thiopental (App. 217; Add. 34\n(§E.3)).  Doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians qualified to set IV lines\nare also qualified to examine their lines and the line entry sites to insure that the IV\nline is operating as it should be (App. 371A-371B, paragraphs 3-6).  This direct\nexamination of the catheter site will alleviate Taylor’s concern (Appellee’s Brf.,\npages 22, 27) that the execution will continue if the setting of the IV results in the\nlaceration of a blood vessel, the formation of a hematoma under the skin at the IV\nentry site, and an infiltration that prevents an adequate dose of thiopental from\n12\n\nreaching the vein.  It needs also to be noted here that significant hematoma formation\nfrom a femoral venous line is not a typical event (June Tr. 297).3\nTaylor, at pages 31 and 34 of his brief, also contends that the corrections\nofficials’ expression of continued confidence in Dr. Doe and his capabilities will\nresult in the doctor having “unbridled” authority in future executions (Appellee’s\nBrf., page 34).  But the officials’ continued confidence in Dr. Doe does not mean they\nwill not exercise the oversight called for  in the written protocol (App. 218) over Dr.\nDoe or whoever else they may choose to prepare and administer the lethal chemicals.\nMoreover, the protocol specifically requires that any changes in the amounts of drugs\nused be pre-approved by the Director of the Department of Corrections (App. 215\n(§ B.1)).  The Director will make the medical personnel involved in executions fully\naware of the terms of the protocol (June Tr. 374).  And, if Dr. Doe continues to assist\nwith executions, he understands that he is not to alter the amounts of chemicals used\nwithout first getting approval from the Director (App. 731-33).\nTaylor, at page 40, n.16 of his brief, takes issue with the reservation by the\ncorrections officials of the option of changing the amount of thiopental to be\nadministered if circumstances prevent administration of five grams of this chemical.\nBut there is no suggestion, and the corrections officials have no intention, that an\n     3The corrections officials also note that Taylor’s experts’ diagnosis of the\noccurrence of a hematoma at the Johnston execution through their review of a\nphotograph should be viewed with some skepticism (June Tr. 46-48, 153-54, 229-31).\nThis  is  especially  so  because  the  passage  of  only  five  minutes  between  the\nadministration of the first chemical and the time of death (Tr. 415, 804) indicates a\ngood flow of the chemicals into Johnston’s bloodstream.\n13\n\namount inadequate to cause deep unconsciousness will ever be administered at an\nexecution.  As noted previously, even Taylor’s expert, Dr. Henthorn, agreed that as\nlittle as 1.67 grams will be adequate to quickly cause a deep state of unconsciousness\nin almost everyone (June Tr. 233, 241-42).\nTaylor also challenges the corrections officials’ argument that the district\ncourt’s requirement that they always have the assistance of a doctor at executions\nexceeded the court’s remedial powers.  Taylor, at pages 43-44 of his brief, contends\nthat, once the court concluded there was a constitutional violation, it had the power\nto exercise remedial discretion to cure the violation.  \nThe premise of Taylor’s contention is incorrect.  As the corrections officials\nhave shown, there is no constitutional deficiency in their lethal injection procedure.\nThus, the district court, as a matter of law, lacked any authority to impose injunctive\nrelief.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1276 (1971). \nEven if there were a constitutional violation here, Taylor’s contention is still\nincorrect.  As the Supreme Court made plain in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637,\n650 (2004), challenges to execution procedures are challenges to prison conditions.\nAs a challenge to prison conditions, the Prison Litigation Reform Act mandates that\n[p]rospective relief . . . shall extend no further than necessary to correct\nthe violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\nThe court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the\ncourt finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least\nintrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\nThe court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public\nsafety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\n14\n\n18 U.S.C. §3626(a)(1)(A).  Even if Missouri’s lethal injection procedure did violate\nany federal right, the prospective relief ordered here – assistance of a doctor at\nexecutions – exceeded the district court’s remedial authority because that requirement\nis not the least intrusive necessary to correct any violation.  The court could have\nsimply ordered direct observation of the condemned after administration of the\nthiopental for signs of consciousness or examination of the IV catheter site after\nadministration of the thiopental to determine whether the IV is operating as intended,\nas the written protocol now directs.  Or the court could have directed that the medical\npersonnel involved have some minimum level of training with regard to setting IV\nlines, assessing operation of these lines, and/or assessing anesthetic depth.   There is\ncertainly a level of training with regard to the discrete and relevant skill sets at issue\nhere that is less than that level of training received by doctors in general and\nanesthesiologists in particular.  At least the court could have given the corrections\nofficials the option of execution by means of a massive dose of thiopental alone or\nsome other barbiturate or combination of barbiturates, without any direction that a\ndoctor be present.  See Morales v. Hickman, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1037, 1047 (N.D. Cal.\n2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006).  \nMoreover, the recent decision in Hamilton v. Jones, 2007 WL 18926 (10th Cir.,\nJan. 4, 2007), upheld Oklahoma’s lethal injection procedure even though it did not\nprovide for the assistance of a doctor.   Rather, an EMT-P (paramedic) establishes the\nIV lines, insures their patency, and administers the chemicals.   Id. at *2.  The court\nalso affirmed the district court’s determination that the possibility that the thiopental\n15\n\nused might not actually take effect to anesthetize the condemned prisoner is, “[i]n\nlight of the precautions already built into the protocol, . . .  simply far too remote to\nrise to a constitutional level . . . .”  Id.\nThe  Hamilton  decision  demonstrates  both  that  Missouri’s  written  lethal\ninjection protocol, which incorporates safeguards comparable to those embodied in\nthe Oklahoma protocol, is consistent with Eighth Amendment requirements and that,\neven if there were some deficiency in Missouri’s protocol, there is a less intrusive\nremedy than the requirement that a doctor take part in the process.  \n16\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs demonstrated above and in the main brief, Missouri’s lethal injection\nprocedure is consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  The corrections officials urge\nthis Court to reverse the district court’s entry of judgment against them, to vacate the\ndistrict court’s orders imposing conditions on, and continuing oversight over, the\nimplementation of their execution procedure against plaintiff Taylor and other\ncondemned prisoners, and to remand this case to the district court with instructions\nto enter judgment in their favor.  Executions in Missouri should be allowed to\nproceed as provided in its written protocol.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEREMIAH W.

Purkett, Superintendent, Eastern *\nReception  Diagnostic  & *\nCorrectional Center, *\n*\nAppellants. *\n________________\nSubmitted: January 10, 2007\nFiled: June 4, 2007\n________________\nBefore RILEY, BEAM, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.  \n________________\nHANSEN, Circuit Judge.\nThe State of Missouri, through its officers Larry Crawford and James D. Purkett\n(collectively \"the State\"), appeals the district court's judgment, which concludes that\n\nMissouri's lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional.  Finding no wanton infliction\nof cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, we reverse.\nI.\nMichael Anthony Taylor pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death in Missouri\nstate court for the abduction, abuse, and brutal murder of 15-year-old Ann Harrison.1\nHis convictions and sentence have withstood judicial scrutiny on direct appeal, see\nState v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo. 1996) (en banc), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1152\n(1997), and in federal habeas corpus proceedings, see Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d\n963 (8th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 947 (2004).  Mr. Taylor filed this 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 action in the federal district court, the timeliness of which was not contested,\nchallenging the State's three-chemical procedure used in carrying out a sentence of\ndeath by lethal injection.  See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 546.720 (describing the manner of\nexecution as either the administration of lethal gas or lethal injection, and authorizing\nthe department director to make sufficient provisions for carrying out either method).\nAt the time Mr. Taylor brought suit, the State intended to use its unwritten\nprocedure of administering a lethal combination of three chemicals through an\nintravenous line (IV) placed in the femoral vein.  In prior executions, a physician\nplaced  the  IV  and  prepared  the  chemicals,  and  nonmedical  prison  personnel\nadministered the injections in a three-step process.  First, a 5-gram dose of sodium\npentothal (also known as thiopental) was injected to render the inmate unconscious.\nSecond, a 60-milligram dose of pancuronium bromide was administered to paralyze\nthe inmate's muscles, and third, a 240-milliequivalent injection of potassium chloride\nwas injected to stop the heart.  A saline flush followed each injection. Mr. Taylor now\nasserts that Missouri's procedure creates a significant risk that he might suffer the\n1We will not here recount the facts of his crime as they are not relevant to this\nappeal.  \n-2-\n\nwanton infliction of pain because if the first chemical, thiopental, does not sufficiently\nanesthetize him, he will feel the pain of the third chemical, potassium chloride, which\nindisputably will cause an excruciating burning sensation as it travels through his\nveins to induce a heart attack, and yet he would be unable to indicate that he is\nexperiencing pain due to the paralyzing effects of the second chemical, pancuronium\nbromide.  \nThe district court failed to set a hearing on the merits of Taylor's complaint in\na timely fashion, and this court ultimately ordered the chief district judge to reassign\nthe case to a different judge who would hold an immediate hearing and make a ruling.2\nIn an order dated January 31, 2006, the district court initially concluded that the three-\nchemical sequence was not unconstitutional, and Mr. Taylor appealed.  Concluding\nthat justice was not served by the expedited nature of that hearing, though the district\ncourt had fully complied with our prior order requiring it, we remanded for additional\ndiscovery and a continuation of the evidentiary hearing to provide Mr. Taylor an\nadequate opportunity to fully present the merits of his claim.  \nOn remand, the district court permitted the parties to engage in a period of\nadditional discovery and reconvened the evidentiary hearing on June 12-13, 2006.\nThe  additional  discovery  permitted  access  to  the  Department  of  Correction's\ndocuments and logs pertaining to the last six executions and a limited anonymous\ndeposition of John Doe I (\"Dr. Doe I\"), the physician in charge of mixing the\nchemicals and inserting the IVs for the past six executions.  The execution logs reveal\n2The procedural particularities of this case are recounted fully in our prior\ndecisions, Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1096-98 (8th Cir. 2006) (retaining\njurisdiction but remanding for additional discovery and a continued evidentiary\nhearing), and Taylor v. Crawford, 457 F.3d 902, 904 (8th Cir. 2006) ( remanding for\nthe district court to consider the State's proposed written protocol in the first instance).\nWe will not repeat that procedural history here, except as necessary for a clear\nunderstanding of the current appeal.\n-3-\n\nthat Missouri does no toxicology reporting following an execution to ascertain the\namount of chemicals actually in the body at the time of death. Dr. Doe I indicated that\nthe chemical amounts listed in the execution logs are not always accurate as they\nrepresent only \"an approximation\" of the chemicals used and disposed of; he does not\nrecord the amount of the dose actually administered to the inmate as the logs are used\nonly for prison inventory and DEA reporting requirements.  (See Appellants' App. at\n647-49.)  In each of the past six executions, however, death occurred in five minutes\nor less from the time the first chemical was administered, and there was not a scintilla\nof evidence that any prisoner ever suffered any pain other than what was necessary to\nacquire access to the prisoner's circulatory system through the insertion of the needed\nintravenous lines.  \nDr. Doe I revealed that he has dyslexia, which causes him to transpose letters\nand numbers, but he asserted that his condition is not significant to his work.  \"I can\nmake these mistakes, but it's not medically crucial in the type of work I do as a\nsurgeon.\"  (Id. at 660.)  As he understood Missouri's unwritten procedure, he had the\nindependent authority to alter the chemical doses at will based on his medical\njudgment, and that in fact, there were occasions when he chose to give a dose of only\n2.5 grams of thiopental without notifying the director, but in his opinion, this dose was\nsufficient.  Under the unwritten procedure, Dr. Doe I would monitor the anesthetic\ndepth of the inmate to ensure he was fully unconscious solely by observing the\ninmate's facial expression through an observation window.\nThe district court allowed the plaintiff to conduct a Rule 34 inspection and\nvideotaped tour of Missouri's execution chamber.  The inspection revealed that the\noperations room in which the chemicals are mixed and administered is lit when the\nchemicals are mixed but dark during the execution, though the execution chamber\nremains lit during the execution.  The observation window from which Dr. Doe I\nobserves the procedure is partially obstructed by blinds, and the inmate faces away\nfrom the window.  During the procedure, the inmate's face is left uncovered, but the\n-4-\n\nrest of his body, including the femoral vein injection site, is completely covered by a\nsheet. \nAt the continued evidentiary hearing, Mr. Taylor presented the testimony of Dr.\nMark  Heath,  an  anesthesiologist,  and  Dr.  Thomas  Henthorn,  an  expert  in\npharmacokinetics.  These experts agreed that the third injection (the potassium\nchloride) would be exceedingly painful if administered without having first achieved\nadequate anesthetization of the condemned inmate.\nDr. Heath criticized the State's lack of a written protocol, asserting that a clearly\nwritten protocol is important so the procedure can be rehearsed and to ensure a\nhumane execution.  He noted that significant variations from the articulated procedure\nhad occurred, citing Dr. Doe I's testimony that he had in fact prepared a dose of only\n2.5 grams for the previously carried out execution, as well as for Taylor's previously\nscheduled execution despite the State's representation that it used a 5-gram dose.  Dr.\nHeath noted that Dr. Doe I admitted he did not keep accurate chemical logs, contrary\nto standard practice.  In Dr. Heath's opinion, Dr. Doe I, a board-certified surgeon, is\nnot competent to oversee the induction of general anesthesia and would not be hired\nat any hospital in the United States as an anesthesiologist. \nDr. Heath opined that a humane execution under this three-chemical protocol\nrequires a state of anesthesia deep enough for surgery.  He admitted that a dose of\neither 2.5 or 5 grams of thiopental would be sufficient to reach this depth and that, in\nfact, rapid induction of anesthesia for surgery is generally achieved in the average\nadult with a 0.28-gram dose.  He expressed concern, however, that setting a high\ndosage level alone does not guarantee the successful delivery of that dose into\ncirculation  and  urged  the  use  of  additional  independent  monitoring  to  ensure\nsuccessful delivery of the chemical into the bloodstream.\n-5-\n\nDr. Henthorn testified that an anesthetic depth known as \"burst suppression,\"\nwhich is deeper than that required for surgery, must be reached for a humane lethal\ninjection protocol because absent this depth, it is possible to be unconscious and still\nfeel pain.  He testified that burst suppression will be achieved in one minute and 45\nseconds using a 5-gram dose of thiopental and in just under three minutes using a dose\nof 2.5 grams.  He was of the opinion that the State's past practice did not include a\nlong enough wait time to ensure adequate anesthetization before administering the\nsecond and third chemicals.  He also stated that once burst suppression is achieved\nwith a 5-gram dose of thiopental, it will be maintained for at least 45 minutes with no\nadditional monitoring necessary.  He identified several potential problems that can\nadversely affect the proper delivery of the anesthetic, such as an improperly prepared\ndose, a leaking tube that could not be detected if the IV site is covered by a sheet, or\nan IV insertion error that could cause the anesthetic to be administered into tissue\nrather than the bloodstream. \nMr. Taylor also presented the testimony of Dr. Stephen Johnson, a radiologist\nand expert in femoral line placement.  Dr. Johnson testified that femoral vein access,\nwhich had been used routinely under the unwritten protocol, is unnecessary and\nproduces an unreasonable risk of unnecessary pain.  He opined that the risk of pain\nfrom the IV procedure can be significantly reduced by using peripheral access–the\nstandard IV placement on the top of the hand. \nTestifying for the State, Dr. Mark Dershwitz, an anesthesiologist, stated that\nrapid sequence inducement of unconsciousness is achieved in approximately 45\nseconds with a dose of as little as 0.3 to 0.4 grams of thiopental in a clinical setting,\nand no pain beyond that point will be perceptible to the inmate.  In his opinion, while\nthe high dose of thiopental administered in the lethal injection process will achieve\nburst suppression, that level of anesthesia is far in excess of the anesthetic depth\ntargeted for surgery, and in his opinion, a depth of unconsciousness sufficient to\neliminate pain occurs much earlier than burst suppression.  Dr. Dershwitz testified that\n-6-\n\nhe had recently examined the results of a bispectral index monitor (\"BIS monitor\")\nthat had been used in a North Carolina execution to monitor the level of the inmate's\nconsciousness.  Dr. Dershwitz stated that a BIS value of between 60 and 40 is targeted\nfor surgery, with 40 being the deepest level of unconsciousness used in a clinical\nsetting.  He stated that a BIS level of 40 is the point at which burst suppression begins,\nand any level lower than 40 is considered to be unnecessarily deep for surgery.  He\ntestified that the North Carolina execution logs indicated that a three-gram dose of\nthiopental was administered and the protocol required a BIS level of 60 before\npermitting the administration of the remaining two chemicals.  Dr. Dershwitz said that\nthe logs indicated that there had been no pause in the injection of the chemicals in that\ncase because once the thiopental and saline flush had been completely administered,\na process that lasted approximately 1-1/2 minutes, the BIS value was already at zero\nwith a flat line electroencephalogram (EEG). \nDr. Dershwitz agreed with Dr. Henthorn that either a 2.5-gram or a 5-gram dose\nof thiopental, successfully delivered, will produce burst suppression requiring no\nfurther need to monitor anesthetic depth.  He stated that mixing the thiopental is not\na difficult task and that \"certainly, most people who are intelligent can be taught to\nmix up a drug like thiopental properly.\"  (June 13, 2006, Hearing Tr. at 331.)  Dr.\nDershwitz expressed the opinion that putting a patient to sleep is easy; the skill of the\nanesthesiologist lies in keeping the surgery patient stable and alive and successfully\nwaking the patient at the end of the procedure.  The last two purposes, of course, are\nnot the objects of a lethal injection execution procedure. \nLarry  Crawford,  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Corrections  (the\nDepartment) since early 2005, acknowledged that he has the overall responsibility for\nthe execution process, that the process had been put in place before his arrival in the\noffice with heavy reliance on the expertise of Dr. Doe I, but that he had independently\nconsidered the procedure  when he first arrived.  He admitted he had not been notified\nwhen Dr. Doe I made the decision to lower the dose of thiopental to 2.5 grams.\n-7-\n\nDirector Crawford indicated that he was planning to issue a new directive with a\ndefined protocol setting forth the procedure and articulating the areas of discretion.\nDirector Crawford indicated that he was confident in Dr. Doe I’s competence and\nexpected that he would continue working with the execution process.3  Director\nCrawford testified that he did not intend to carry out Mr. Taylor's execution before\nissuing a new directive, stating, \"I want to assure that the process is better.\"  (Id. at\n377.) \n \nFollowing the hearing, the district court entered an order on June 26, 2006,\nconcluding that Missouri's existing three-chemical procedure presents an unnecessary\nrisk that an inmate will suffer unconstitutional pain during the lethal injection process.\nSee Taylor v. Crawford, No. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG, 2006 WL 1779035 (W.D. Mo. June\n26, 2006) (unpublished).  The district court identified several concerns with Missouri's\nexecution protocol, namely, the lack of a written protocol specifying the chemicals\nand doses, the lack of consistency in its administration, the total discretion placed in\nthe hands of Dr. Doe I, and the lack of any oversight of his conduct during the\nprocess.  Additional concerns included Dr. Doe I's dyslexia, his lack of concern over\nhow that might affect his ability to mix the lethal chemicals, and his limited ability to\nmonitor  the  anesthetic  depth  of  the  inmate  reliably  when  his  view  is  partially\nobstructed by blinds, and the inmate's position in the execution room. \nThe district court then invoked its equitable powers to fashion a detailed\nremedy.  Specifically, the court ordered the Department of Corrections to prepare a\nwritten protocol  requiring the participation of a board-certified anesthesiologist, not\nless than a 5-gram dose of thiopental, certification that the inmate has achieved\n3In a post-oral argument submission, the State informed our court that it was no\nlonger its intention to utilize the services of Dr. Doe I.  Although the State's frequent\nand solemn prior representations to us and to the district court that it had always used\na 5-gram dose of thiopental proved to be erroneous, in this instance we will take the\nState at its word. \n-8-\n\nsufficient  anesthetic  depth  before  injecting  the  last  two  chemicals,  and  giving\ndiscretion to the anesthesiologist to choose the best method and location for the\ninjection site.  The order also required the Department to include a procedure for\nmonitoring anesthetic depth, which may require the purchase of additional equipment\nand the repositioning of the inmate in the execution room; a contingency plan to deal\nwith problems that may arise during the procedure; and an auditing process to ensure\nthat the individuals involved are complying with the protocol.  The district court\nfurther ordered that once approved, the protocol may not be changed absent prior\ncourt approval.  Finally, the district court stayed all executions pending approval of\na new protocol.  In compliance with our prior instructions, see Taylor, 445 F.3d at\n1099, the district court certified its order to this court.\nOn July 14, 2006, the State submitted a written lethal injection protocol to the\ndistrict court.  Taylor objected on grounds that this new protocol was too vague and\ndid not follow the district court's requirement to secure the participation of a board-\ncertified anesthesiologist.  The district court correctly noted that it lacked jurisdiction\nto consider the new protocol because the case was on appeal to this court.  On August\n9, 2006, we therefore remanded the entire dispute to provide the district court the first\nopportunity to consider the constitutionality of the newly propounded protocol.\nTaylor, 457 F.3d at 904. \nOn September 12, 2006, the district court entered an order concluding that the\nState's written protocol, while \"an improvement over the previous procedures,\" was\nstill inadequate to provide sufficient constitutional protections.  (Appellants' Add. at\n27.)  The district court ordered that to continue using the three-chemical protocol, the\nState must modify the proposal to provide that Dr. Doe I shall not participate, to\nrequire a physician with training in anesthesia to mix the chemicals, to provide for the\npossibility of purchasing additional equipment to monitor anesthetic depth, and to\nalter the record-keeping requirements.  Instead of complying with that order, the State\nsought reconsideration, which the district court denied.  \n-9-\n\nThe State appeals, asserting that the district court erred in concluding that its\nlethal  injection  protocol  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment.    We  review  de  novo\nquestions of law arising under the Constitution, Hayes v. Faulkner County, Ark., 388\nF.3d 669, 673 (8th Cir. 2004), and the district court's findings of fact for clear error,\nRoyal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 722 (8th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1061\n(2005).  \nII.\nWe think it prudent at the outset to set forth clearly what this case is not about.\nTo do so, we borrow the apt words penned recently by Judge Fogel, United States\nDistrict Judge for the Northern District of California, dealing with the same issue: \n[C]ourts . . . exist not to resolve broad questions of social policy but to\ndecide specific legal and factual disputes . . . .  This case is not about\nwhether the death penalty makes sense morally or as a matter of policy:\nthe former inquiry is a matter not of law but of conscience; the latter is\na question not for the judiciary but for the legislature and the voters.  Nor\nis it about whether [Missouri's] primary method of execution–lethal\ninjection–is constitutional in the abstract: the arguments and evidence\npresented by the parties address the specific manner in which [Missouri]\nhas implemented that method and proposes to do so in the future.\nMorales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp. 2d 972, 973 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (internal citations\nomitted)  (finding  serious  but  correctable  deficiencies  in  the  implementation  of\nCalifornia's lethal injection protocol and urging California's executive branch to\naddress the implementation problems).\nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments, which\napplies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S.\n294, 296-97 (1991), requires, in part, an inquiry into whether a punishment is\nexcessive, and that inquiry has two aspects.  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173\n-10-\n\n(1976) (plurality).  \"First, the punishment must not involve the unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain.  Second, the punishment must not be grossly out of\nproportion to the severity of the crime.\"  Id. (internal citations omitted).  Mr. Taylor\npresents no argument that the penalty of death by lethal injection is grossly out of\nproportion to the severity of his crime.  Instead, the question in this case is limited to\nwhether the process of carrying out the lethal injection sentence involves \"the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\"  Id. \nThe State begins by challenging the standard used by the district court.  The\nState first argues that the district court erred in finding a constitutional violation on\nthe basis of its determination that the Missouri lethal injection protocol involves an\nunnecessary risk of causing the wanton infliction of pain.  The State asserts that the\nSupreme Court's articulation of the standard forbids only punishment that actually\ninvolves \"the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\" id.  at 173 (emphasis added),\nnot a mere risk of pain.  We respectfully disagree.  \"An inmate's challenge to the\ncircumstances of his confinement . . .  may be brought under § 1983.\"  Hill v.\nMcDonough, 126 S. Ct. 2096, 2101 (2006).  In Hill, the Court included within this\nrule an action challenging a state's lethal injection protocol.  The Court quoted the\npetitioner's  statement  of  his  claim,  noting,  \"[t]he  specific  objection  is  that  the\nanticipated  protocol  allegedly  causes  'a  foreseeable  risk  of  .  .  .  gratuitous  and\nunnecessary' pain.\"  Id. at 2102.  While we do not imply that the Court thereby\nadopted a new constitutional standard, we do observe that the Court expressed no\ndissatisfaction with that statement of the issue, and further, we find it to be consistent\nwith settled Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.  \nIn general conditions-of-confinement claims involving either a prison condition\nallowed to exist or the specific conduct of prison officials, neither of which is\nsanctioned as part of the prisoner's sentence, the Court has recognized that \"conditions\nposing  a  substantial  risk  of  serious  harm\"  may  rise  to  the  level  of  an  Eighth\nAmendment violation.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  \"That the\n-11-\n\nEighth  Amendment  protects  against  future  harm  to  inmates  is  not  a  novel\nproposition.\"  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993); see also id. at 34-35\n(rejecting the proposition \"that only deliberate indifference to current serious health\nproblems of inmates are actionable under the Eighth Amendment,\" and permitting the\ncase to proceed).  \"Court of Appeals cases to the effect that the Eighth Amendment\nprotects against sufficiently imminent dangers as well as current unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain and suffering are legion.\"  Id. at 34; see also Aswegan v.\nHenry, 49 F.3d 461, 464 (8th Cir. 1995) (noting that deliberate indifference to\n\"conditions posing a substantial risk of serious future harm\" violates the Eighth\nAmendment).  \nAlthough  Mr.  Taylor's  situation  does  not  fit  neatly  within  the  general\nconditions-of-confinement context because the conduct of which he complains is\nnecessary  to  carry  out  his  punishment,  as  opposed  to  a  mere  condition  of  his\nimprisonment, we nevertheless see no logical reason to disregard a substantial risk that\nmay exist in the procedure necessary to carry out a sentence of death.  It is our grave\nresponsibility to apply constitutional principles that will guard against the unnecessary\nand wanton infliction of pain in the procedure through which the State proposes to\ncarry out a sentence of death, and to successfully do so in the death penalty context,\nwe must consider whether the procedure to be used presents a substantial risk of\ninflicting unnecessary pain.  We see no error in the district court's consideration of\nwhether there is an unnecessary risk that the State's proposed lethal injection protocol\nwill cause the unnecessary and wanton  infliction of pain.  See Hudson v. McMillian,\n503 U.S. 1, 8 (1992) (\"What is necessary to show sufficient harm for purposes of the\nCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause depends on the claim at issue, for two\nreasons:\"  (1) we must apply the wanton infliction of pain standard by giving \"due\nregard for differences in the kind of conduct against which the Eighth Amendment\nobjection is lodged,\" and (2) the \"prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments\ndraw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of\n-12-\n\na maturing society, and so admits of few absolute limitations.\" (internal quotations and\ncitations omitted) (alteration in original)).\nWe emphasize, as did the district court, that we are not concerned with a risk\nof accident.  The focus of our inquiry is whether the written protocol inherently\nimposes a constitutionally significant risk of pain.  \"The cruelty against which the\nConstitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment,\nnot the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life\nhumanely.\"  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947)\n(plurality).  A \"risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution\nprocess in order to survive constitutional review.\"  Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662,\n687 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1119 (1994).  If Missouri's protocol as written\ninvolves no inherent substantial risk of the wanton infliction of pain, any risk that the\nprocedure will not work as designated in the protocol is merely a risk of accident,\nwhich is insignificant in our constitutional analysis.  Resweber, 329 U.S. at 464\n(noting that a risk of an \"unforeseeable accident\" interfering with the designated\nprocedure is not constitutionally significant). \nSecond, the State asserts that the district court applied the wrong standard by\nnot requiring Mr. Taylor to demonstrate deliberate indifference on the part of the\nprison officials in order to prevail on his § 1983 claim.  As noted above, this claim is\nnot the typical conditions-of-confinement claim challenging prison conditions in\ngeneral nor does it involve the action of a particular officer that is not part of the\ndesignated punishment for the crime.  See Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644\n(2004) (articulating the difficulty of categorizing this particular type of claim).  The\nSupreme Court requires an inquiry into the state of mind of particular state officials\nonly where the official conduct does not purport to be part of the official penalty for\nthe crime.  See Wilson, 501 U.S. at 302. \n-13-\n\nThe source of the intent requirement is . . . the Eighth Amendment itself,\nwhich bans only cruel and unusual punishment.  If the pain inflicted is\nnot formally meted out as punishment by the statute or the sentencing\njudge, some mental element must be attributed to the inflicting officer\nbefore it can qualify.\nId. at 300.  The potential pain alleged in this case would be inflicted as the state-\nsanctioned punishment because the proposed protocol is intended to be used to carry\nout the lawfully imposed sentence.  See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644 (noting that the\n\"imposition of the death penalty presupposes a means of carrying it out\").  The\ninfliction of capital punishment is itself a deliberate act, deliberately administered for\na penal purpose.  See Wilson, 501 U.S. at 300.  The protocol at issue is created by the\nDepartment's director, in whose discretion state law places the matter, and it is created\nfor the purpose of carrying out the sentence in a humane manner.  See Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 546.720 (placing the responsibility for carrying out a lawful sentence of death by\nlethal  injection  solely  within  the  hands  of  the  Director  of  the  Department  of\nCorrections).  The propriety of this proposed protocol in the first instance (that is,\nwhether it achieves the goal of carrying out the punishment in a humane manner or\nin fact uses torturous methods), therefore, depends upon whether the protocol as\nwritten would inflict unnecessary pain, aside from any consideration of specific intent\non the part of a particular state official.\nThe State relies on language in Resweber for its insistence that the plaintiff\nmust demonstrate a purpose to inflict harm, but Resweber presented a different\nsituation.  The Court there concluded that a second attempt at electrocution (after the\nfirst attempt had failed due to technical problems) was not unconstitutional, finding\nthere was \"no purpose to inflict unnecessary pain.\"  Resweber, 329 U.S. at 464\n(emphasis added).  A state of mind inquiry was necessary in that case because the\nconduct at issue – a second application of electrocution – was not authorized by\nstatute nor was it the regular procedure adopted by state officials for carrying out a\nsentence  of  death.    The  Court  found  that  the  state  official's  decision  to  apply\n-14-\n\nelectrocution a second time was constitutional because it was the result of an accident\nand was not done for the purpose of inflicting pain.  See id. (emphasizing that the\nunforeseeable equipment failure during the first electrocution made a second attempt\nnecessary, and \"an unforeseeable accident . . . cannot . . . add an element of cruelty\");\nsee also id. at 471 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (indicating that a different outcome\nmay have resulted had there been a showing of willful multiple applications of\nelectrocution).  The conduct challenged in the present case is neither alleged to be\naccidental nor a deviation from the official procedure, which would require a showing\nof an intent to harm or deliberate indifference.  Instead, the official conduct challenged\nis the State's designated procedure for deliberately carrying out the prescribed penalty\nintended to punish the inmate.\nWe turn then to the task of assessing whether Missouri's lethal injection\nprotocol amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, involving a substantial foreseeable\nrisk  of  the  wanton  infliction  of  pain.    The  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain through torture, barbarous methods, or\nmethods resulting in a lingering death.  See Gregg, 428 U.S. at 170.  The Eighth\nAmendment is interpreted in a flexible manner, \"'acquir[ing] meaning as public\nopinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.'\"  Id. at 171 (quoting Weems v.\nUnited States, 217 U.S. 349, 378 (1910)).  \"'The Amendment must draw its meaning\nfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society'\"\nand \"accord with 'the dignity of man.'\"  Id. at 173 (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S.\n86, 100-01 (1958) (plurality)).\n  \nThe evidence reveals that the only inherent risk in Missouri's written procedure\narises from the specific chemicals chosen by the State to carry out the sentence of\ndeath by lethal injection.  Lethal injection itself \"is commonly thought to be the most\nhumane form of execution.\"  Abdur'Rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 306 (Tenn.\n2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2288 (2006); see also Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d\n1064, 1074 (9th Cir.) (specifically noting that humane concerns were a motivation for\n-15-\n\nadopting lethal injection as the presumptive method of execution in California), cert.\ndenied, 543 U.S. 1096 (2005).  There is no dispute, however, that the third and last\nchemical chosen for use in this protocol will cause excruciating pain if the inmate is\nnot adequately anesthetized and that use of the second chemical in the sequence will\nsimultaneously  mask  any  visible  sign  of  that  pain.    Because  of  those  inherent\nproperties of two of the chemicals chosen to carry out the sentence of death, we must\ncarefully evaluate the designated procedure to determine whether it sufficiently\nsafeguards against the infliction of this excruciating pain such that any lingering risk\nis not of constitutional magnitude.\nThe written protocol is a four-page document divided into six sections–(A)\ndescribing the execution team; (B) describing the preparation of the chemicals; (C)\ndescribing the process for inserting the  intravenous  lines;  (D)  setting  rules  for\nmonitoring the prisoner; (E) setting rules for administering the chemicals; and (F)\ndocumenting the chemicals.  The protocol requires a more than adequate 5-gram dose\nof thiopental, and the quantities of chemicals prescribed in the sequence may not be\nchanged without prior approval of the department director.4  The execution team\nconsists of contracted medical personnel and department employees.  As noted earlier,\nthe State has indicated that Dr. Doe I will not be participating in the procedure.  A\nphysician,  nurse,  or  pharmacist  prepares  the  chemicals,  which  are  injected  by\nnonmedical department employees.  A physician, nurse, or emergency medical\ntechnician holding either an \"EMT-intermediate or EMT-paramedic\" certification\ninserts the intravenous lines, establishing both a primary and a secondary IV (which\n4Specifically, the procedure requires 15 syringes – the first 4 syringes contain\na total quantity of 5 grams of thiopental, the next syringe contains only saline solution,\nthen 60 milligrams of pancuronium bromide, then saline solution, then two syringes\ncontaining a total of 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride, and the tenth syringe\ncontains saline solution.  Four additional syringes, each containing an extra 1.25 gram\ndose of thiopental, are prepared in case additional anesthetic is required, and one\nadditional syringe of extra saline solution is prepared.  \n-16-\n\nmust be a peripheral line) unless the prisoner's physical condition prevents the use of\ntwo lines.  (Appellants' Add. at 32.)  The protocol provides the medical personnel with\ndiscretion to determine the best place to insert the IV lines, and it requires that the\nmedical  personnel  be  qualified  with  the  appropriate  training,  education,  and\nexperience to perform the IV placement procedure determined to be most appropriate.\nThe protocol requires medical personnel to confirm that the IV lines are\nworking properly both before and during the procedure and to attach and monitor an\nelectrocardiograph during the execution procedure.  Medical personnel must supervise\nthe injection of the contents of the syringes by department employees. Before the\nsecond and third chemicals are injected, medical personnel must examine the prisoner\nphysically to confirm that he is unconscious using standard clinical techniques and\nmust inspect the catheter site again.  The second and third chemicals are injected only\nafter confirmation that the prisoner is unconscious and after a period of at least three\nminutes has elapsed from the first injection of thiopental.  The protocol also requires\naccurate documentation of the chemicals given, the order in which they were given,\nand the quantities of chemicals used and discarded.  Any deviations from the written\nprotocol must be promptly reported to the department director. \nThe  district  court  concluded  that  the  State's  written  protocol,  while  an\nimprovement over the unwritten procedure, was still constitutionally deficient.  The\ncourt ordered the State to modify its proposal as follows:  (1) the written protocol\nmust require the participation of a physician with training in the administration of\nanesthesia and must prohibit Dr. Doe I from participating in the lethal injection\nprocess,  (2)  the  written  protocol  must  provide  for  the  purchase  of  additional\nequipment to adequately monitor anesthetic depth, (3) the written protocol's record-\nkeeping procedures must comply with specific requirements set forth by the court, (4)\nthe protocol must provide for court review of any deviation from it, and (5) the written\nprotocol may not be implemented by medical personnel such as paramedics or EMTs\nunless they are employed by the supervising physician.\n-17-\n\nOur independent review of the State's written protocol and the record in this\ncase leads us to the conclusion that the written protocol does not violate the Eighth\nAmendment, and thus, the district court had no basis on which to impose an equitable\nremedy requiring further modification of the protocol.  The concerns that the district\ncourt noted and required to be modified do not rise to the level of creating a\nconstitutionally significant risk of pain. \nThe experts agree that if a 5-gram dose of thiopental is successfully delivered,\nthere is virtually no risk that an inmate will suffer pain through Missouri's three-\nchemical sequence.  The experts also agree that a properly functioning IV, even\nperipherally placed, will adequately deliver the dose and that the inmate will then be\nsufficiently unconscious in less than two minutes, without the need of any further\nmonitoring.  The written protocol requires a 5-gram dose of thiopental and a three-\nminute wait before injecting the final two chemicals.  The written protocol sufficiently\nprovides  for  proper  delivery  of  that  dose  by  requiring  the  IV  insertions  to  be\naccomplished by medical personnel (a physician, nurse, or EMT) who is qualified to\nperform the task, who must confirm before the procedure begins that the IV is\nfunctioning properly and not obstructed, and who must inspect the site again before\nthe final two chemicals are injected.  The physician, nurse, or EMT is given discretion\nonly with regard to determining the proper placement of the IV and the appropriate\nprocedure for insertion of the IV.  The physician, nurse, or EMT is required to\nexamine the prisoner physically using standard clinical techniques to determine that\nhe is unconscious before the second and third chemicals are administered.\nBecause of the pain that undoubtedly would be inflicted by the third chemical\nif administered without adequate anesthetization, it is imperative for the State to\nemploy personnel who are properly trained to competently carry out each medical step\nof the procedure.  The protocol adequately requires trained medical personnel to carry\nout these steps and to verify that the IV is working properly.  The protocol provides\n-18-\n\nno opportunity for personal judgment regarding the proper dose, because the protocol\nmandates a dose large enough to render anyone deeply unconscious, as long as it is\ndelivered properly.  The protocol is designed to ensure a quick, indeed a painless,\ndeath, and thus there is no need for the continuing careful, watchful eye of an\nanesthesiologist or one trained in anesthesiology, whose responsibility in a hospital's\nsurgery suite (as opposed to an execution chamber) is to ensure that the patient will\nwake up at the end of the procedure.  \"For exceedingly practical reasons, no State can\ncarry out an execution in the same manner that a hospital monitors an operation.\"\nWorkman v. Bredesen, No. 07-5562, 2007 WL 1311330, at *12 (6th Cir. May 7,\n2007),  cert.  denied,  127  S.  Ct.  2160  (May  8,  2007).    Absent  some  specific\ndisqualifying characteristic of the chosen medical personnel, we would be hard\npressed to say that a physician, a trained nurse, or a licensed pharmacist is not\nqualified to mix the chemicals.  We know of no decision holding that the Constitution\nrequires a physician to become the executioner.  See generally id. at *12 (stating that\nthe Constitution does not require the State to hire an anesthesiologist for each\nexecution);  McKenzie v. Day, 57 F.3d 1461, 1469 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 514 U.S.\n1104 (1995) (stating, \"we are aware of no authority for the proposition that the\nprisoner  is  entitled,  for  example,  to  have  a  lethal  injection  administered  by  a\nphysician\"). \nNeither does the record justify requiring the continuous monitoring of the\nanesthetic depth of the inmate by one trained in anesthesia or by additional equipment.\nThe written protocol requires a 5-gram dose of thiopental to be delivered through a\nproperly placed and working IV, combined with a three-minute wait and a physical\nconfirmation of unconsciousness before the last two chemicals are administered.  The\nexperts agree that this dose, successfully delivered, will cause burst suppression in less\nthan three minutes and last at least 45 minutes, which eliminates any need for further\nmonitoring.  Given the dose of thiopental provided in the protocol, the precautions\ntaken to ensure it is successfully delivered, the three-minute wait built into the\nprotocol  before  administration  of  the  second  and  third  chemicals,  the  ready\n-19-\n\navailability of syringes containing an additional five grams of thiopental, and the\nphysical examination of the prisoner and the IV site prior to administering the second\nand third chemicals, there simply is no realistic need for further monitoring of\nanesthetic  depth  by  a  physician  or  sophisticated  equipment  to  prevent  a\nconstitutionally significant risk of pain.\nThe Constitution does not require the use of execution procedures that may be\nmedically optimal in clinical contexts.  See Hamilton v. Jones, 472 F.3d 814, 816\n(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1054 (2007).  \"The state has broad discretion to\ndetermine the procedures for conducting an execution . . . .\"  McKenzie, 57 F.3d at\n1469.  \"[W]e recognize that what could be done to update or even improve the\nprotocol is not the appropriate legal inquiry to be undertaken by this or any other\nreviewing court.\"  Abdur'rahman, 181 S.W.3d at 309.  Where the \"procedures are\nreasonably calculated to ensure a swift, painless death,\" they are \"immune from\nconstitutional attack,\"  McKenzie, 57 F.3d at 1469, as the Constitution protects only\nagainst the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain.  What the Sixth Circuit said\nabout the Tennessee protocol is equally true about Missouri's:  \"The whole point of\nthe [Missouri] lethal-injection protocol is to avoid the needless infliction of pain, not\nto cause it.\"  Workman, 2007 WL 1311330, at *9.  The State's written protocol does\nnot present any substantial foreseeable risk that the inmate will suffer the unnecessary\nor wanton infliction of pain.  The abundant dose of thiopental, lethal in itself and over\n17 times that given for surgeries, combined with built-in checks to ensure that the IV\nis properly placed by medical personnel trained for the procedure and that the IV is\nworking  and  not  obstructed,  renders  any  risk  of  pain  far  too  remote  to  be\nconstitutionally significant.  See id. at *12 (noting that the risks of pain in a similar\nprotocol  \"remain  remote  []and  do  not  occur  when  the  procedure  is  properly\nimplemented\"); Hamilton, 472 F.3d at 816-17 (noting that the risk involved must be\nof constitutional magnitude; and denying an injunction upon concluding that the\ndistrict court correctly determined, in light of the precautions built into Oklahoma's\n-20-\n\nprotocol, that the risk of failure to monitor resulting in the alleged pain is far too\nremote to rise to a constitutional level).\nWe emphasize that Mr. Taylor has not adduced evidence at any stage of this\nlitigation that carries his burden of proving a constitutional violation.  We have very\ncarefully examined the entire record, and we find no evidence to indicate that any of\nthe last six inmates executed suffered any unnecessary pain that would rise to an\nEighth Amendment violation or that any state actor was deliberately indifferent to the\nConstitution's requirement that no unnecessary pain be wantonly inflicted during the\nexecution process. \nIII. \nWe conclude that Missouri's written lethal injection protocol does not violate\nthe Eighth Amendment.  The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\ninjunction the district court issued is vacated.  \n______________________________\n-21-",

Box 899\nJefferson City, MO  65102\n\n(573) 75l-332l\nAttorneys for Appellees\nSUMMARY AND REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT\nPlaintiff-Appellant  Michael  Anthony  Taylor  challenges  Missouri’s  three-drug\nlethal injection procedure as violative of the Eighth Amendment’s ban of cruel and\nunusual  punishments.    Taylor  also  claims  that  his  due  process  rights  under  the\nFourteenth Amendment will be violated because a physician will assist in preparations\nfor the execution in that such assistance by a physician is a violation of medical ethics.\nAdditionally, Taylor asserts that lethal injection, as performed in Missouri, violates the\nThirteenth  Amendment  in  that  it  constitutes  a  badge  of  slavery.    Finally,  Taylor\ncontends that he was denied due process because of the trial being scheduled on short\nnotice and because of evidentiary rulings of the district court.\nTaylor,  however,  had  sufficient  time  to  develop  and  to  present  his  case,\nincluding sufficient time to prepare and present the witnesses whose testimony he\nconcluded  was  necessary.    The  evidence  that  could  have  been  provided  by  the\nwitnesses Taylor was precluded from calling, could have been provided by alternative\nwitnesses.    The  district  court’s  findings  and  conclusions  as  to  the  constitutional\nvalidity of Missouri’s lethal injection procedure were also well supported both factually\nand legally.\n1\n\nThe  defendant-appellee  prison  officials  request  twenty  minutes  for  oral\nargument.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE & FACTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n   A.

Because of the facts\nfound,  the  district  court  properly  denied  relief.    [Responds  to  Point  II  of\nAppellant’s Brief.]\nJohnston v. Crawford, No. 4-04-CV-1075 CAS, (E.D.Mo. Aug. 26, 2005); \nBeardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2005);\nLouisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947); and\nReid v. Johnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543 (E.D.Va. 2004).\nII.\nWhether the district court abused its discretion (1) in refusing to permit\nplaintiff-appellant  Taylor  to  call  the  doctor  and  nurse  involved  in  Missouri\nexecutions  as  witnesses  where  the  testimony  Taylor  proposed  to  elicit  from\nthem  would  have  added  little  or  nothing  of    relevance  or  could  have  been\nprovided by other witnesses available to Taylor, or (2) in holding the hearing\nin  a  time  frame  that  may  have  prevented  Taylor  from  presenting  testimony\nfrom an expert witness where the expert’s testimony would not have been of\n6\n\ncritical  import  and  where  Taylor  neither  articulated  the  substance  of  the\nexpert’s expected testimony nor unequivocally asked for a continuance of any\nlength for the purpose of obtaining the expert as a  witness.  [Responds to Point\nI of Appellant’s Brief.]\nMercurio v. Nissan Motor Corp., 81 F. Supp. 2d 859 (N.D. Ohio 2000);\nWoods v. Lecureux, 110 F.3d 1215 (6th Cir. 1997);\nDakota Indus., Inc., v. Dakota Sportswear, Inc., 988 F.2d 61 (8th Cir. 1993);\nand\nBeard v. Flying J, Inc., 266 F.3d 792 (8th Cir. 2001).\n7\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE & FACTS\nPlaintiff-appellant Michael Anthony Taylor initiated this litigation on January 3,\n2005, by filing a complaint for preliminary injunctive relief, declaratory injunctive relief,\nand a permanent injunction against his execution by means of Missouri’s current lethal\ninjection procedure (Doc. No. 1).  He filed the amended complaint on September 12, 2005\n(Doc. No. 36).  In his complaints, Taylor challenged Missouri’s execution process\ngenerally.  The defendant-appellee prison officials filed their motion to dismiss the case\non September 26, 2005 (Doc. No. 30).  Meanwhile, the prison officials filed answers to\ninterrogatories on August 30, 2005, and to supplemental interrogatories on October 5,\n2005 (Doc. Nos. 33, 42).  They provided supplemental interrogatory answers on\nNovember 18, 2005 (Doc. No. 48).\n   On November 27, 2005, after the conclusion of Taylor’s habeas proceeding, the\nstate asked the Supreme Court to set an execution date.  On November 22, 2005, the\nMissouri Supreme Court sustained the state’s motion to set an execution date.  It ordered\nthat an execution date would be set in due course.  With this information, Taylor did not\nseek a hearing or other disposition of his complaint before his execution.  \nOn December 28, 2005, the district court denied the prison official’s motion to\ndismiss the case (Doc. No. 54).  After this ruling, Taylor made no request for a hearing.\n8\n\nOn January 3, 2006, the Missouri Supreme Court set February 1, 2006 as Taylor’s\nexecution date (Doc. No. 55).  \nOn January 19, 2006, the district court granted plaintiff’s application for an order\nprohibiting his execution (Doc. Nos. 60, 61, 62).  The prison officials appealed that order\n(Doc. No. 63).  On January 29, 2006, the Court of Appeals vacated the stay in part and\nremanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings.  Taylor v. Crawford,\nNo. 06-1278 (8th Cir. January 29, 2006).  \nOn January 30-31, 2006, the district court held an evidentiary hearing (Doc. Nos.\n74, 75).  The district court found Taylor’s claims meritless (Doc. No. 76).  Judgment was\nentered in favor of the prison officials on January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 77).  Taylor filed a\nNotice of Appeal on the same day (Doc. No. 80).  On February 1, 2006, a panel of this\nCourt denied Taylor’s request for stay of execution, but the Court en banc issued a stay.\nThe United States Supreme Court declined to vacate that stay.\n9\n\nState Court Procedural History\nTaylor was charged by indictment in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, State of\nMissouri, with one count of murder in the first degree, in violation of §565.020, RSMo.\n1994; one count of the felony of armed criminal action, in violation of §571.015, RSMo.\n1994; one count of the Class B felony of kidnapping, in violation of §565.110, RSMo.\n1994; and one count of the felony of forcible rape, in violation of §566.030, RSMo. Cum.\nSupp. 1993.\nOn February 8, 1991, Taylor appeared with his attorneys before the Honorable\nAlvin C. Randall and expressed his desire to enter a plea of guilty to these charges in open\ncourt and on the record pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.01(b).  After a three\nday punishment phase hearing, Judge Randall sentenced Taylor to death.  Taylor was also\nsentenced to life imprisonment for rape, fifteen years imprisonment for kidnapping, and\nten years imprisonment for armed criminal action, all terms to run consecutively.  \nTaylor brought a post-conviction action pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule\n24.035, challenging his guilty plea and sentence.  After an extensive evidentiary hearing\nthe circuit court denied Taylor's post-conviction motion.  \nTaylor filed an appeal challenging the guilty plea, the imposition of the death\npenalty and the denial of the Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief, and argued to\n10\n\nthe Missouri Supreme Court some fifteen claims of error.  The Missouri Supreme Court\nissued the following order on June 29, 1993:\nORDER\nJudgment  vacated.    Cause  remanded  for  new  penalty  hearing,\nimposition of sentence, and entry of new judgment.  \nTaylor's second punishment phase hearing before Judge Michael Coburn began on\nMay 2, 1994.  Initially, Judge Coburn heard evidence for three days.  The evidence was\nheld open, and Taylor was allowed to present the testimony of additional witnesses on\nMay 12, 1994 and June 6, 1994.  The state adduced evidence concerning the abduction\nand murder of Ann Harrison, as well as evidence of Taylor's escape from custody.  The\ndefense called ten witnesses in purported mitigation of punishment.\n   On June 17, 1994, over three years after he had first received the penalty of death,\nTaylor appeared before Judge Coburn for formal sentencing.  In oral and written findings,\nJudge Coburn found six statutory aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt,\nas well as three non-statutory aggravating circumstances.  Judge Coburn found the\nexistence of one mitigating circumstance, rejecting several others offered by Taylor, and\nconcluded  that  the  mitigating  circumstance  did  not  outweigh  the  aggravating\ncircumstances of this case, making the sentence of death appropriate.  Taylor also received\nfifty years for armed criminal action, fifteen years for kidnapping and life imprisonment\nfor rape, all terms to run consecutively.  Taylor filed an appeal.  He also sought post-\n11\n\nconviction relief under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 24.035.  This time, again on\nconsolidated appeal, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed.  State v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d\n209 (Mo. banc 1996).  The United States Supreme Court denied discretionary review.\nTaylor v. Missouri, 519 U.S. 1152 (1997).  \nTaylor initiated a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Missouri.  The district court denied the petition, and on\nMay 7, 2003, this Court affirmed.  Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d 963 (8th Cir. 2003), cert.\ndenied, 541 U.S. 947 (2004).  \nStatement of Facts\nThe Supreme Court of Missouri described the circumstances surrounding Taylor's\noffenses in the direct appeal opinion. \nAccording  to  Taylor's  testimony  at  his  guilty  plea,  Taylor's\nvideotaped statement and other evidence adduced in the sentencing hearing,\nTaylor and a companion, Roderick Nunley, spent the night of March 21,\n1989, driving a stolen Chevrolet Monte Carlo, stealing \"T-tops,\" smoking\nmarijuana and drinking wine coolers.  At one point during the early morning\nhours of March 22, they were followed by a police car, but lost the police\nafter a high speed chase on a highway.  About 7:00 a.m., they saw fifteen-\nyear-old Ann Harrison waiting for the school bus at the end of her driveway.\nNunley told Taylor, who was driving at the time, to stop so Nunley could\nsnatch her purse.  Taylor stopped the car, Nunley got out, pretended to need\ndirections, grabbed her and put her in the front seat between Taylor and\nNunley.  Once in the car, Nunley blindfolded Ann with his sock and\nthreatened to stab her with a screwdriver if she was not quiet.  Taylor drove\nto Nunley's house and took Ann to the basement.  By this time her hands\nwere bound with cable wire.  Nunley removed Ann's clothes and had\nforcible sexual intercourse with her.  Taylor then had forcible intercourse\n12\n\nwith her.  They untied her, and allowed her to dress.  Ann tried to persuade\nthem to call her parents for ransom, and Nunley indicated he would take her\nto a telephone to call home.  They put the blindfold back on her and tied her\nhands and led her to the trunk of the Monte Carlo.  Ann resisted getting into\nthe trunk until Nunley told her it was necessary so she would not be seen.\nBoth men helped her into the trunk.\nNunley then returned to the house for two knives, a butcher knife and\na smaller steak knife.  Nunley argued with Taylor about whether to kill her.\nNunley did not want Ann to be able to testify against him and emphasized\nhe and Taylor were in this together.  Nunley then attempted to slash her\nthroat but the knife was too dull.  He stabbed her through the throat and told\nTaylor to \"stick her.\"  Nunley continued to stab, and Taylor stabbed Ann\n\"two or three times, probably four.\"  He described how \"her eyes rolled up\nin her head, and she was sort to like trying to catch her, her breath.\"  \nNunley and Taylor argued about who wold drive the Monte Carlo,\nand Nunley ended up driving it following Taylor who was driving another\ncar.  Taylor picked up Nunley after he abandoned the Monte Carlo with Ann\nHarrison in the trunk.  They returned to Nunley's house where Nunley\ndisposed of the sock, the cable wire, and the knives.\nWhen the school bus arrived at the Harrison home to pick up Ann, the\ndriver honked because she was not there.  Mrs. Harrison looked out of the\nwindow and noticed Ann's purse, gym clothes, books, and flute lying on the\ndriveway.  She waved for the bus to go on and began to look for her\ndaughter.  Police quickly mounted a ground and air search.  Ann Harrison's\nbody was discovered the evening of March 23rd when police found the\nabandoned Monte Carlo and a friend of the car's owner opened the trunk.\nThe  State's  physical  evidence  included  hair  matching  Taylor's\ncollected from Ann Harrison's body and the passenger side of the Monte\nCarlo, hair matching Ann's collected from Nunley's basement, sperm and\nsemen belonging to Taylor found on Ann's clothes and body.  An autopsy\nrevealed a lacerated vagina, six stab wounds to Ann's chest, side, and back\nwhich penetrated her heart and lungs, and four stab wounds to her neck.  The\nmedical examiner testified Ann Harrison was alive when all the wounds\n13\n\nwere inflicted and could have remained conscious for ten minutes after the\nstabbing.  She probably lived thirty minutes after the attack.\nState v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209, 214 (Mo. banc 1996) (footnote omitted).\nWith regard to Taylor’s challenges to Missouri’s execution process in this case, the\ndistrict court described the lethal injection procedure as follows:\n[T]he procedure is accomplished through the use of three drugs which are\nadministered by a board certified physician. The physician first administers\nfive grams of sodium pentothal, also known as thiopental, which is a\nsubstance that produces anesthesia. Thereafter, the physician administers a\nsyringe of saline to flush the IV line. Next, the physician administers\npancuronium bromide, also referred to as pancuronium. This drug is a\nparalytic agent which prevents any involuntary movement of the body. The\nphysician then again administers the saline solution. Finally, the third drug\nwhich is administered is potassium chloride, which is a drug which stops the\nelectrical  activity  of  the  heart.  .  .  .  [T]he  average  time  to  complete\nadministration of the drugs is between two and five minutes and the average\ntime of death from when the drugs are administered until the time of death\nwas between two and five minutes.  Dr. Dershwitz [the prison official\ndefendants’ expert] testified that if the above outlined protocol is followed,\nthere is no chance that an inmate\nwould experience pain or suffering.\nOrder of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at pp. 2-3.1\n1This Order is included in the addendum to this Brief.\n14\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nThe district court properly entered judgment on behalf of the defendant-appellee\nprison officials.  The evidence produced by plaintiff-appellant Taylor and the prison\nofficials at the evidentiary hearing amply support the fact findings and legal conclusion\nof the district court that Missouri’s lethal injection process does not inflict cruel and\nunusual punishment.  As the district court found, following the administration of the first\ndrug – on anesthetic - there is not a significant risk that a condemned prisoner will be\nconscious to experience the lethal effects of the other  two drugs.  The evidence also\nsupported the district court’s conclusion that administration of the drugs through a\nfemoral vein IV catheter would cause little if any pain.\nTaylor’s additional claims that Missouri’s lethal injection procedure violates his\ndue process and Thirteenth Amendment rights, even if not abandoned due to omission\nfrom his brief, are also meritless.  Presence of a doctor at the execution is not a breach of\nthe doctor’s ethical obligations and, thus, cannot violate the condemned prisoner’s due\nprocess rights for that reason.  Taylor’s Thirteenth Amendment claim fails because that\namendment expressly excepts from its coverage those being punished for a crime and\nbecause Taylor failed to show how prisoners of different races are treated differently.\nWith regard to Taylor’s issues concerning evidence and witnesses, the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in holding the hearing in a time frame that may have prevented\n15\n\nTaylor from presenting testimony from a third expert witness.  That expert’s testimony\nwould not have been of critical import and, additionally, Taylor neither articulated the\nsubstance of the expert’s expected testimony nor asked for a continuance of any length\nfor the purpose of securing the testimony of the expert.\nNeither did the district court abuse its discretion in declining to permit Taylor to\ncall the doctor and nurse involved in Missouri executions as witnesses.  The testimony\nTaylor proposed to elicit from them would have added little or nothing of  relevance and\ncould have been provided by other witnesses available to him.\n16\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nOn review of a bench trial, as occurred here, the appellate court reviews the trial\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.  Darst-Webbe\nTenant Ass'n Bd. v. St. Louis Housing Auth., 339 F.3d 702, 710-11 (8th Cir. 2003).\nWith regard to questions involving the admissibility of evidence, district courts\nhave wide discretion and their decisions on such questions will not be disturbed absent\na showing of a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Bennett v. Hidden Valley Golf\nand Ski, Inc., 318 F.3d 868, 878 (8th Cir. 2003).\nThe standard of review of a denial of a motion for continuance is abuse of\ndiscretion.  Beard v. Flying J, Inc., 266 F.3d 792, 802 (8th Cir. 2001).\n17\n\nARGUMENT\nI.  \nThere was sufficient evidence from which the fact finder could find that\nthe  Missouri  method  of  execution  process  was  proper  and  conclude  that\nplaintiff-appellant Taylor’s Eighth Amendment rights would not be violated by\nhis execution because the evidence demonstrated that the dosage of the first\ndrug in the three drug sequence rendered the condemned unconscious while the\nremaining drugs stopped breathing and the heart and use of the femoral vein\nwas effective and without pain.  \nIn the district court, Taylor contended that use of the three drug sequence would\nviolate his Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment because the\nfirst drug (sodium pentothal) would wear off before death, the second drug (pancuronium\nbromide) would result in paralysis preventing any communication of awareness of pain,\nand the third drug (potassium chloride) would cause pain as it travels to the heart and\nstops it (Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 36), pp. 20-21).  In his second count, he\ncontended that the injection into the femoral vein would also be painful (Amended\nComplaint (Doc. No. 36), pp. 25-26).  The district court properly rejected these grounds\nafter an evidentiary hearing.  The judgment of the district court should be affirmed.  \n18\n\nThe Three-Drug Sequence.  Evidence at hearing showed that Missouri uses a\nthree-drug sequence in its lethal injection process.  The first drug administered is sodium\npentothal, also known as thiopental, which is a substance that produces anesthesia.  The\ndosage used in Missouri is 5 grams - - more than 10 times the amount used to begin a\nsurgery.  Then the line is flushed with saline solution.  The second drug is pancuronium\nbromide, which acts upon the body’s muscles to prevent movement.  Following a second\nsaline solution flush, the third drug administered is 240 millequivalent dose of potassium\nchloride, which is a drug that stops the electrical activity of the heart.  Order of January\n31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76, at pp. 2-3).  Taylor contends in his amended complaint that the\ndosing of the first drug may be insufficient to prevent the painful effects of drugs two and\nthree on the condemned.  Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 36), at pp. 3-4 & 20-21.\nThe district court rejected Taylor’s contention, finding that the initial dose of\nsodium pentothal was sufficient to render the condemned unconscious when the second\nand third drugs are administered.  In particular, the district court held:\nHowever, based upon the testimony which was presented by the\nwitnesses, the Court does not find that there is a significant risk that the\nmeans and method which the Missouri Department of Corrections uses will\ncause unnecessary pain and suffering.  Dr. Dershwitz testified that the dose\nof sodium pentothal which is administered, 5 grams, has a very long lasting\neffect.  Thus, the likelihood that the inmate will still be conscious when the\nother drugs are administered is highly unlikely.  Other courts who have\nexamined this procedure have also found that it is not cruel and unusual.  In\nJohnston v. Crawford, No. 4-04-CV-1075 CAS, (E.D.Mo. Aug. 26, 2005),\nthe Court stated:\n19\n\nPlaintiff’s evidence is inadequate to demonstrate that\nMissouri’s  execution  protocol  would  subject  him  to  the\nunnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain,  torture  or  a\nlingering  death.    Plaintiff’s  evidence  suggests  only  a\npossibility, rather than a probability, that he may remain\nconscious and sensate long enough to experience pain during\nhis execution.  For instance, in the affidavit of Dr. Heath\nsubmitted in support of the TRO motion, Dr. Heath opines that\n“the failure to properly administer the sodium pentothal”\nwould create an unjustifiable risk that a prisoner will be\nconscious during the remainder of the execution.  But as\npreviously noted the ever-present possibility of human error\nor  accident  is  insufficient  to  establish  a  constitutional\nviolation.  Louisiana ex rel. Francis [v. Resweber], 329\nU.S.[ 459,] 464 [(1947)]: see also Estelle [v. Gamble], 429\nU.S. [97,] 105 [(1976)]; Beardslee [v. Woodford], 395 F.3d\n[1064,] 1075 [(9th Cir. 2005)].  \nFurthermore, plaintiff’s evidence does not adequately\ndemonstrate the nature or the duration of the possible pain\nrelative to the likely degree of sedation so as to establish that\nthe  quantum  of  pain  would  violate  Eighth  Amendment\nstandards. ...  The record fails to establish any foreseeable\nprobability that the use of the Missouri protocol would result\nin  an  execution  involving  torture  of  unnecessary  pain  of\nunconstitutional magnitude or length.\nId. at pp. 4-5.  This conclusion has been reached by other courts that have\nalso considered challenges to lethal injection protocols.  In Beardslee v.\nWoodford, No. C 04-5381 JF, 2005 WL 40073 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2005),\naff’d 395 F.3d 1064 (2005), the Court stated, “even with protocols under\nwhich only two grams of sodium pentothal-as opposed to the five grams\nused in California- are to be administered, the likelihood of such an error\noccurring ‘is so remote as to be nonexistent.’” Id. at *3.  See also Reid v.\nJohnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543 (E.D.Va. 2004).  Therefore, the Court does\nnot find that the plaintiff has demonstrated that Missouri’s means of\naccomplishing lethal injection violate the Eighth Amendment.\n20\n\nOrder of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at pp. 5-6.  As amply demonstrated by the\ndistrict court order, there was sufficient evidence to support the district court order. \nMr. Terry Moore, the Director of Adult Institutions for the Missouri Department\nof Corrections testified about the procedures that would be used to execute Taylor.  Order\nof January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at pp. 2-3.  Dr. Dershwitz testified that the procedures\nproduced no chance that an inmate would experience pain or suffering.  Id., at p. 3.  In\nparticular, evidence from Dr. Dershwitz showed that the dose of the first drug, sodium\npentothal, was so large that 99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious after\nreceiving it.  Defendants’ Trial Exhibit 1, at ¶ 8.2  Of course, unconsciousness, instead of\ndeath, would depend on the presence of life support devices to keep the lungs going and\nto support blood pressure.  Testimony of Dr. Dershwitz.  The effect of the sodium\npentothal itself would kill the condemned, but more slowly than if all three drugs are\nadministered.  Testimony of Dr. Dershwitz; Defendants’ Trial Exhibit 1, at ¶ 8.  Although\nnot an anesthesiologist, plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Groner, concurred that the dose of sodium\npentothal was lethal.  Order of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at p. 3.  Taylor’s other\nexpert, Dr. Heath, concurred in this conclusion, with the caveat that death would take up\nto twenty minutes in some individuals.  Id., at p. 4.  \n2Defendants’ Trial Exhibit 1 is included in the addendum to this Brief.\n21\n\nAgain, the district court’s findings and conclusions were amply supported by the\nevidence - not only by the testimony cited by the court, but by Defendants’ Trial Exhibits\n1, 3, 4 and 5.3 As reported by the district court, even the testimony presented by Taylor is\nconsistent as to the effect of the five gram dose of sodium pentothal upon the body.  Order\nof  January  31,  2006  (Doc.  No.  76),  at  pp.  3-4.  That  dose  produces  immediate\nunconsciousness and, over a slightly longer period, death.  Id.  Taylor articulates no\ndisagreement with these findings and conclusions in his brief before this court.\nInstead, on appeal Taylor attempts to find a reversible issue as to drug 3, potassium\nchloride.  He claims that administration of drug 3 is painful.  Taylor’s brief, p. 17.\nAssuming that is true, it ignores the context of the lethal injection, where potassium\nchloride is the third drug injected, not the first.  The five gram dose of the first drug,\nsodium  pentothal,  which  renders  99.9999999%  of  the  condemned  unconscious\n(Defendants’ Trial Exhibit No. 1), fulfills its purpose of being an effective anesthesia.  In\nthe context of lethal injection, the condemned would not feel any of the alleged pain from\nthe potassium chloride.  Testimony of Dr. Dershwitz; Defendants’ Trial Exhibit No. 1.\nOn appeal, Taylor cannot validly argue that drug 3 will cause pain.  Thus, he\nsuggests that drug 3 creates a “needless risk of pain.”  Taylor’s brief, p.17.  But again, all\nexperts agreed that the five grams of sodium pentothal was a lethal dose.  Dr. Dershwitz\n3Defendants’ Trial Exhibits 3, 4, and 5 are also included in the addendum to this\nBrief.\n22\n\nestablished that 99.9999999% of the condemned would be unconscious after receiving\nthat dose.  Defendants’ Trial Exhibit No. 1.  The risk of pain is minuscule.\nOn appeal, Taylor also suggests that Dr. Dershwitz “presented no testimony about\nthe data he used to form this opinion, and [he] had never witnessed a Missouri execution.”\nTaylor’s brief, p. 17.  Taylor did not object to Dr. Dershwitz testifying as an expert\nwitness.  He did not object to the testimony and opinions of Dr. Dershwitz as not having\na sufficient foundation.  And, as noted by the district court, Taylor’s experts, Drs. Groner\nand Heath, also testified that five grams of sodium pentothal was a lethal dose.\nTaylor also criticizes Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony because Dr. Dershwitz had not\npersonally administered a dose of five grams of sodium pentothal.  Taylor’s brief, p. 20.\nIf this is a criticism of Dr. Dershwitz’s opinion, then, as noted, Taylor did not object on\nthis basis at trial.  And Taylor’s experts did not testify that they had administered five\ngrams of sodium pentothal; thus, under Taylor’s theory, their testimony is similarly\ninadmissable or suspect.  But Dr. Dershwitz did properly identify himself with sufficient\nqualifications to be an expert witness.  Defendants’ Trial Exhibit 2 (Dr. Dershwitz’s CV).\nTaylor also criticizes Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony because Dr. Dershwitz works in\nan operating room with monitoring equipment.  Taylor brief, pp. 20-21.  Taylor did not\nmake an evidentiary objection at trial on this basis.  Moreover, operating room equipment\ndoes not make Drs. Dershwitz, Heath, or Groner any more or any less an expert witness\n23\n\nwith relevant testimony.  And, in any event, the condemned is linked to a monitor, an\nEKG, which will show the end of electrical activity in the heart.  See testimony of Terry\nMoore.  \nOn appeal, Taylor asserts that the lethal injection process is a “medical procedure”;\nthus, he has a constitutional right to have it conducted according to a “medical standard\nof care.”  Taylor’s brief, p. 21.  The premise of the contention is unproven.   It is not a\n“medical procedure,” but rather a means of implementing punishment, carried out due to\nthe lawful judgment entered by the Jackson County (Missouri) Circuit Court due to\nTaylor’s conviction for first degree murder.  Lethal injection is a method of punishment\nthat  the  Missouri  Legislature  has  made  the  Missouri  Department  of  Corrections\nresponsible for implementing.  Whether the Department uses or does not use medical\npersonnel is a matter of discretion for the Department.  And its use of such personnel does\nnot transform the punishment into a “medical procedure,” that is to be measured by a\n“medical standard of care” by a preemptive medical malpractice lawsuit, cloaked as a civil\nrights lawsuit or a habeas petition before each and every execution.\nIn summary, the five gram dose of sodium pentothal is sufficient to render\n99.9999999% of the condemned unconscious.  Accordingly, the district court, and indeed\nevery court that has considered this issue, has properly concluded that the Eighth\n24\n\nAmendment  prohibition  against  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  is  not  violated  by\nexecution by lethal injection.  \nFemoral Vein Access.  In Count II of the amended complaint, Taylor complained\nabout the use of his femoral vein for the lethal injection.  Amended complaint, pp.25-26.\nThe district court heard evidence about this process during the trial and concluded that\nTaylor’s Eighth Amendment rights would not be violated by use of this process.  The\ndistrict court determination should be affirmed.\nAfter hearing evidence about access to the venous system through the femoral vein,\nthe district court concluded:\nPlaintiff also argues that method by which the drugs are administered\nis also cruel and unusual in that the drugs are administered through the\nfemoral vein, rather than through a vein in the inmates’s arm.  However, the\nCourt  is  also  not  persuaded  that  this  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual\npunishment.  The testimony was that an injection is administered to numb\nthe area before the catheter is inserted so that the inmate will experience\nlittle if any pain.  There was testimony that complications can arise with the\nplacement of the catheter and that it might become dislodged or that it is\nsometimes difficult to locate the femoral vein.  However, as noted, above,\nthese slim possibilities do not show that the procedure is cruel and unusual.\nOrder of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at pp. 6-7.  The text of Taylor’s brief does not\nchallenge the factual findings by the district court.  He does not show that they are “clearly\nerroneous.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).  Instead Taylor quibbles about the weight of the\nevidence vis-a-vis those findings.  The court should reject those arguments.  \n25\n\nThe evidence at the hearing showed the importance of delivering the initial five\ngram dose of sodium pentothal.  Plaintiff’s expert Dr. Heath premised his conclusion that\nfive grams of sodium pentothal was a lethal dose upon it being administered properly into\nthe condemned.  See also Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-1075 CAS, slip op. at 5\n(E. D. Mo. Aug. 26, 2005) (quoting Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th\nCir. 2005).  Indeed, Taylor alleges 12 “botched” executions due to problems with IV\naccess through the peripheral (hands and arms) venous access, Taylor’s brief, p. 22,4 the\nalternative to femoral vein access.  But testimony by Taylor’s experts at the hearing\nprovided anecdotal evidence of two executions involving the access: Mr. High of Georgia\nand Mr. Ross of Connecticut.  Testimony indicated there were multiple attempts to find\na suitable peripheral vein on those individuals.  With Mr. Ross, after several attempts, a\nvein was found, and with Mr. High, a doctor obtained access to a vein under the clavicle.\nAnd testimony at the hearing indicated that access by the femoral vein is easy to\nobtain.  Generally, the vein is big and easy to locate.  Access to the vein is obtained by\nneedle.  A local numbing agent reduces discomfort.  The area is cleansed to avoid\ninfections.  Access is obtained by a board-certified surgeon.  Testimony at the hearing\n4There  was  no  testimony  about  12  or  22  “botched”  executions  before  the\ndistrict court and Taylor cites no evidence to support his contention about “botched”\nexecutions.  Taylor’s brief, p. 22.\n26\n\nestablishes the rigorous training all surgeons receive.  The Johnston court also recognized\nthat the procedure in Missouri was performed by a board-certified surgeon who was\nqualified to perform the procedure.  Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-1075 CAS, slip\nop. at 8 (E. D. Mo. Aug. 26, 2005).  \nTaylor contends, at page 18 of his brief, that use of the femoral vein creates an\n“additional risk of discomfort.”  He argues, in essence, that because it is not known that\nthe peripheral veins will not be sufficient, the state should be required to try those first -\ndespite the problems his experts identified in the High and Ross cases.  As noted above,\neffective access to the venous system is necessary to deliver the five gram dose of sodium\npentothal. \nTaylor’s experts suggested there is a risk of accident by femoral vein access.  But\nas noted by Dr. Heath, Taylor’s expert, there are also risks of accident by using the\nperipheral veins.   The word “risks” is but another name for accident, which Taylor\nconcedes is not a basis for an Eighth Amendment claim.  Taylor brief, p. 18.  See also\nLouisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 461-3 (1947).  \nOn appeal, Taylor complains that with femoral vein access, there is a risk of\naccident from striking bone or a nerve.  Taylor brief, p. 20.  Dr. Heath testified that a\nsimilar risk exists with the peripheral vein access.  And there was also testimony about\nthose problems with Mr. High and Mr. Ross.  But accidents with either the peripheral vein\n27\n\naccess or femoral vein access do not constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\nFrancis, 329 U.S. at 461.  \nLastly, Taylor suggests that use of the femoral vein access is a procedure that is not\nmedically necessary; thus, it is inconsistent with the “medical standard of care” necessary\nfor a medical procedure.  Taylor’s brief, p. 21.  As noted earlier, a lethal injection is not\na  medical  procedure  for  which  the  Eighth  Amendment  requires  a  preexecution\nmalpractice suit in the guise of a civil rights or habeas action.  Instead, a lethal injection\nis a method of punishment for Taylor’s crime of first degree murder.  “Medical standard\nof care” does not have meaning in this context.\nThe district court’s findings rejecting Taylor’s factual assertions that Missouri’s\nlethal injection procedure will likely cause undue pain are very well supported and not\nclearly erroneous.  The district court’s legal conclusion that Missouri’s execution process\ndoes not inflict cruel and unusual punishment is cogent and well reasoned and should be\nupheld by this Court as correct as a matter of law.\nTaylor has abandoned Counts III and IV in his brief to this Court by not addressing\nthem.  Even if had not abandoned them, the district court’s judgment against Taylor as to\nthese two claims is well-supported both factually and legally.\nAs to Taylor’s Count III claim that the presence of a doctor at his execution would\nviolate his due process rights because that would be a breach of the doctor’s ethical\n28\n\nobligations, the district court correctly determined that claim to be meritless.  The district\ncourt concluded that a doctor’s participation in the execution process does not violate the\ndoctor’s code of ethics and does not violate a condemned prisoner’s due process rights.\nOrder of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No, 76), at pp. 7 & 9.  The court supported this\nconclusion both logically and on the basis of the existing case law on this point.  Id., at p.\n7  (citing  Abdur’Rahman  v.  Bredesen,  No.  M2003-01767-COA-R3-CV,  2004  WL\n2246227, *9 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2004), aff’d, 2005 WL2615801 (Tenn. Oct 17, 2005)).\nThe district court also found Taylor’s Thirteenth Amendment claim in Count IV\nto be meritless because the amendment expressly excepts those being punished for a crime\nand because Taylor failed to show how prisoners of different races are treated differently.\nOrder of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No, 76), at p. 8 (citing Wendt v. Lynaugh, 841 F.2d 619,\n620 (5th Cir. 1988); Draper v. Rhay, 315 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375\nU.S. 915, 84 S. Ct. 214 (1963)).5\n5Petitioners do not concede here that the action is properly one under § 1983.\nTaylor does not claim an individualized harm from the planned means of execution.\nRather, his challenge is to Missouri’s method of execution as a general matter (as\nillustrated by Taylor’s former co-plaintiff Clay joining Taylor’s case and raising the\nidentical  challenges  to  Missouri’s  lethal  injection  process).    Even  in  Nelson  v.\nCampbell,  541  U.S.  637,  644,  124  S.  Ct.  2117,  2123  (2004),  the  United  States\nSupreme Court did not hold that all method-of-execution claims could be pursued as\nordinary civil litigation under § 1983.  Regardless of whether this case is a suit under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, or a habeas action, the district court judgment rejecting Taylor’s\nclaims should be affirmed.  If this case is a habeas action, the rejection of Taylor’s\nclaims is appropriate because he never obtained approval to proceed from this Court\nas required by  28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3) (before a second or successive application for\n29\n\nhabeas relief is filed in the district court, the applicant must obtain authorization to do\nso from the Court of Appeals).  If this case is under § 1983, then the district court’s\njudgment  should also be affirmed based on its well-supported findings of  fact and\nits cogent application of the law to those facts.\n30\n\nII.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion (1) in refusing to permit\nplaintiff-appellant  Taylor  to  call  the  doctor  and  nurse  involved  in  Missouri\nexecutions  as  witnesses  where  the  testimony  Taylor  proposed  to  elicit  from\nthem  would  have  added  little  or  nothing  of    relevance  or  could  have  been\nprovided by other witnesses available to Taylor, or (2) in holding the hearing\nin  a  time  frame  that  may  have  prevented  Taylor  from  presenting  testimony\nfrom an expert witness where the expert’s testimony would not have been of\ncritical  import  and  where  Taylor  neither  articulated  the  substance  of  the\nexpert’s expected testimony nor unequivocally asked for a continuance of any\nlength for the purpose of obtaining the expert as a  witness.\nContrary to Taylor’s assertion, the hearing in this case was neither truncated nor\notherwise unfair.  Taylor has had ample time and ability (and has made good use of it) to\npursue his claims since his conviction.  Likewise, he had ample opportunity to address his\nclaims in this case with regard to the constitutionality of Missouri’s lethal injection\nprocedure.  Following a trial at which both sides were provided a thorough and fair\nopportunity  to  litigate  the  matter,  the  district  court  here  correctly  concluded  that\nMissouri’s lethal injection procedure is constitutional. Order of January 31, 2006, at p. 9\n(Doc. No. 76).  See also Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-1075 CAS, slip op. at pp.\n31\n\n9-10 (E.D. Mo. August 26, 2005); Johnston v. Roper, 421 F.3d 1152 (8th Cir. 2005) (en\nbanc) (review and denial of Johnston’s motion for stay of execution).  \nThe parties here presented scientific evidence in support of and in opposition to\nTaylor’s claims.  The court’s recognition of the invalidity of these claims was not the\nresult of undue haste or inability to present critical evidence, but rather of the court’s\ncareful and reasoned analysis of the evidence.\nTaylor had sufficient time to prepare his case.  Taylor’s protestations of lack\nof fair notice to prepare his case before the hearing do not take note of his own failure to\nfile a motion for any sort of equitable relief regarding his impending execution until more\nthan two weeks after his execution date had been set or his failure to seek a ruling from\nthe court on the merits of his claims.  This suit has been on file since June 2005.  Taylor\nhad over six months to prepare for the hearing he sought and which he knew would need\nto occur before an expected execution date at a time in the not-too-distant future.  He also\nhad nearly a month after the January 3, 2006, issuance of the execution warrant in this\ncase to prepare his case.  This warrant placed him on notice that to raise his claims in a\nmeaningful manner, he would need to have his evidence prepared for a trial by his\nscheduled February 1 execution date.  This preparation could easily have included the\ntaking of discovery and preservation depositions of necessary expert and fact witnesses.\nThe choice not to engage in such preparation was Taylor’s own.\n32\n\nProposed testimony of Dr. Melethil.  In  particular, Taylor complains of an\ninability to present evidence from Dr. Srikumaran Melethil, a pharmacokineticist.  But\nTaylor admits both that “counsel for [his] team” had been in consultation with this doctor\npreviously and that the doctor had returned from “out of town” by the morning of January\n31.  Taylor’s Brief, at p. 14.  Because Taylor’s lawyers had been consulting with the\ndoctor for a time before the trial in this case,6 they had the opportunity to work with the\ndoctor to prepare testimony regarding the effects of the drugs used  in  Missouri’s\nexecution process for use at trial.  Taylor also had the opportunity to call Dr. Melethil to\ntestify at the trial because it reconvened at 9:30 a.m. on the morning the doctor returned\nto town and continued until nearly noon.\nTaylor asserts, however, that he was still unable to provide the doctor with data\nfrom the defense expert, Dr. Mark Dershwitz.  Aside from noting again that Taylor had\nmore than six months to conduct discovery in this case, Taylor also had knowledge both\nthat Dr. Dershwitz would be the defense expert from early in this suit and of his opinions\nregarding Missouri’s lethal injection procedure.  See Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\n(Doc. No. 38) and Exhibit D to that motion (copy of district court Memorandum and\n6A lawyer on Taylor’s team (counsel to former co-plaintiff Richard D. Clay) has\nbeen in contact with Dr. Melethil since mid-September.  See Declaration of Srikumaran\n(Sri) K. Melethil, Ph.D., J.D., at ¶ 2.  The ability of this Court to consider this\nDeclaration, which has been filed with this Court, but was not part of the record before\nthe district court, is discussed below.\n33\n\nOrder entered in Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-1075 CAS (E.D. Mo. Aug. 26,\n2005), which discussed opinions of Dr. Dershwitz).7  (As public records, Taylor would\nalso have had access to a transcript of Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony from  Johnston v.\nCrawford and his affidavit submitted in that case.)\nLeaving these foregone litigation opportunities aside, Taylor also made no apparent\nattempt to call Dr. Melethil to testify even to the simple and straight forward proposition,\nas expressed in Taylor’s Brief, at p. 14, that Dr. Dershwitz’s analysis was flawed because\nhis conclusions were based on drug levels in the blood instead of drug levels in the brain.\nTaylor, at page 16 of his Brief, compares his position here regarding his purported\ninability to develop and provide testimony from Dr. Melethil to a denial of a continuance.\nBut, while Taylor did object to the timing of the trial in this case in general, he did not\nrequest a continuance in the close of evidence to permit him to obtain testimony from his\nthird expert.  Even though Taylor admitted the return to town of Dr. Melethil on the\nmorning of January 31, and had received a stay of execution until 5 p.m. on February 1,\nhe did not move for a brief continuance in the close of evidence until later that day or early\nthe next morning to procure the testimony of Dr. Melethil.  Given Taylor’s failure to make\nsuch a motion, he cannot now claim error in this regard on the part of the district court.\n7It  is  also  apparent  that  Taylor  was  in  possession  of  a  transcript  of  Dr.\nDershwitz’s testimony from Johnston v. Crawford and his affidavit submitted in that\ncase.  See Declaration of Srikumaran (Sri) K. Melethil, Ph.D., J.D., at ¶ 7.\n34\n\nIn any event, Taylor had already presented testimony from two other experts, a trauma\nspecialist and anaesthesiologist and he did not explain to the court how additional\nevidence from Dr. Melethil would have added anything probative to his claims.  Even if\nTaylor’s statements regarding Dr. Melethil could be construed as an implicit motion for\ncontinuing the close of evidence for a time, the district court would not have abused its\ndiscretion in denying the motion.  See Beard v. Flying J, Inc., 266 F.3d 792, 802 (8th\nCir. 2001) (no abuse of discretion in denial of continuance where proposed additional\nwitness did not prejudice movant’s case).\nHaving passed on the opportunities to develop his case, Taylor’s complaints now\nabout lack of a full opportunity to provide relevant evidence are not compelling.\nTaylor has now submitted to this Court a “Declaration of Srikumaran (Sri) K.\nMelethil, Ph.D., J.D.”  Because this Declaration is not part of the record before the district\ncourt, this Court would not normally consider it.  Dakota Indus., Inc., v. Dakota\nSportswear, Inc., 988 F.2d 61, 63 (8th Cir. 1993).  Even if this Court determines that the\nDeclaration of Dr. Melethil fits within that rarely applied narrow exception to the general\nrule that an appellate court may consider only the record made before the district court,\nsee id., the Declaration shows that testimony from Dr. Melethil would have added little\nto the trial.  Nothing in the Declaration calls the district court’s judgment into doubt.  \n35\n\nThe district court, based on the testimony of Dr. Dershwitz, found the 5 gram dose\nof Thiopental that is administered as the first drug in the lethal injection process to be\nsufficient to render the condemned unconscious throughout the administration and lethal\neffect of the second two drugs.  Order of January 31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at pp. 5-6.  See\nalso Defendants’ Trial Exhibits 1, 3, 4, and 5.  Dr. Melethil’s speculation in the\nDeclaration about the concentration of Thiopental in the brain over time, based on animal\nstudies and lower dosages of Thiopental than used in Missouri executions, does not\nundermine the district court’s conclusion that Missouri’s lethal injection process does not\ncause wanton pain to condemned prisoners.  This is true especially because he does not\ncontradict the evidence that the dose of Thiopental at issue here is not a marginal one, but\none that both of Taylor’s testifying experts state was lethal in itself.  See Order of January\n31, 2006 (Doc. No. 76), at p. 4.  \nThe Declaration of Dr. Melethil provides no suggestion that a dose of Thiopental\nsufficient to result in death could permit any return to consciousness between the initial\nadministration  of  the  drug  and  its  lethal  effect,  much  less  between  the  initial\nadministration of the first drug and the administration of the second and third drugs.  Any\nsuggestion of a possibility of a return to consciousness that could have been testified to\nby Dr. Melethil pales to insignificance in light of Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony that the 5\ngram dose of Thiopental administered as part of Missouri’s lethal injection procedure\n36\n\nwould, with as near certainty as statistics can determine, render  a person unconscious and\ninsensate to pain for hours.  The absence of evidence from Dr. Melethil in this case was\nnot prejudicial to Taylor.  Even if he had testified, the result would have been the same.\nDistrict  Court’s  refusal  to  permit  testimony  from  medical  personnel\ninvolved in Missouri’s executions.  Taylor’s related claim, that he was denied a fair\nopportunity to make his case at the district court hearing because he was not permitted to\ncall the doctor and nurse who are present at Missouri’s executions is also unavailing.\nTestimony from these witnesses would be of no relevance.  The challenge here is to the\nmethod of execution.  Taylor has been given detailed information as to the drugs used,\ntheir doses, and the order and the manner of administration.  That method is what it is\nregardless of who the Missouri Department of Corrections assigns  in any given instance\nto prepare the drugs and set the IV. \nTaylor’s contention that the testimony of these witnesses is relevant as to their\nalertness as to the possibility of pain experienced by the condemned and for their\nobservations at executions, Taylor’s Brief, at p. 12, is also of no avail.  The alertness of\nmedical personnel to the possibility of pain is not relevant because Taylor’s claim here is\nnot inadequate monitoring of executions for distress on the part of the condemned, but\nwhether  there  is  any  actual  infliction  of  undue  pain  by  the  execution  procedure.\nConsidering the thrust of Taylor’s claim being that execution by means of the procedure\n37\n\nused in Missouri will mask pain experienced by the condemned, the observations of\npersons present at executions is not a fruitful or relevant area of inquiry.  Even if\ntestimony from persons present at executions is considered at all relevant, it is still\nproperly excludable if its minimal probative value “is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\nevidence.”  Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \nThe unfair prejudice at issue here is the risk to the security and privacy of whatever\ndoctor and nurse may be involved in an execution should their testimony in a case lead to\nnotice to the general public of their involvement in executions.  If the participating doctor\nand nurse are identified, this could well lead to them being targeted for harassment or even\nphysical retaliation by offenders, their families, their friends, or others opposed to the\ndeath penalty.  The district court, in recognition of these important security and privacy\ninterests, declined to require the prison official defendants to disclose the identities of\npersons directly involved in executions in discovery.  Protective Order of October 31,\n2005 (Doc. No. 46), at p. 2.  \nThe real possibility that disclosure of the identities of persons directly involved in\nthe execution process may result in harassment and possible physical retaliation may also\ncause trained medical staff and correctional staff to be hesitant, or to decline, to participate\n38\n\nin the execution process.  That would hamper the ability of the State of Missouri to find\npersonnel to carry out state-imposed, constitutionally-authorized, and meticulously-\nreviewed state death sentences.8\nAnother factor to be considered in weighing process required by Rule 403 is\nwhether the same evidence can be provided by other witnesses.  Mercurio v. Nissan\nMotor Corp., 81 F. Supp. 2d 859, 861 (N.D. Ohio 2000).  See also Woods v. Lecureux,\n110 F.3d 1215, 1219 (6th Cir. 1997) (preclusion of confusing and unfairly prejudicial\nevidence upheld where district court did not restrict other relevant evidence).  The district\ncourt here did not restrict Taylor’s ability to call other witnesses who have viewed\nexecutions in Missouri.  There are, in fact, other witnesses to executions who could\nprovide testimony as to their observations of executions, see § 546.740, RSMo.  Taylor\ndoes not claim to have made any effort to obtain such alternative testimony.  Further,\nTerry Moore, Director of the Division of Adult Institutions of the Missouri Department\nof Corrections, was a witness at the trial in this case.  Despite Director Moore’s testimony\nthat he had been involved in recent executions, Taylor made no inquiry as to his\nobservations at those executions.\n8The  prison  official  defendants  also  note  that  Dr.  Groner,  one  of  Taylor’s\nexperts, conceded during his testimony that he reports physicians with any role in\nexecutions to their local licensing authorities for breach of their ethical duties.  See\ntestimony of Dr. Groner.  This kind of threat to a professional’s license would impede\nthe ability of a state to obtain the services of medical personnel in the execution\nprocess should their identities become known.\n39\n\nTaylor next asserts that he needed to call the medical personnel present at\nexecutions to explore their qualifications to perform the activities they engage in at\nexecutions.  While the qualifications of the doctor and nurse to be assigned by the\nDepartment  may  have  some  relevance  here,  Taylor  has  been  provided  with  that\ninformation.    The  district  court  assessed  Taylor’s  need  for  information  as  to  the\nqualifications of the medical personnel and instructed the prison official defendants to\nprovide him with the information that is reasonably necessary – “information as to the\ngeneral training, credentials, and qualifications of persons (i.e.: Registered Nurses in the\nState of Missouri or Licensed Medical Doctors identifying any certified or specialized\ntraining) involved in executions in the State of Missouri.”  Protective Order of October\n31, 2005 (Doc. No. 46), at pp. 1-2.  Pursuant to this order the prison official defendants\nhave, subject to the protective order, provided Taylor with the qualifications of the doctor\nand nurse expected to be assigned to his execution, including the information that the\ndoctor is a Missouri licensed physician and a board certified surgeon and that the nurse\nis a licensed practical nurse.  This licensing and certification evidence was also placed into\nthe record at the trial in this case through the testimony of Director Moore.  \nThis evidence of qualifications of the medical personnel was sufficient for Taylor\nto make his points at trial considering the testimony from his experts that a board certified\nsurgeon  was not necessarily qualified to set a femoral vein IV and that neither a board\n40\n\ncertified  surgeon  nor  a  licensed  practical  nurse  were  necessarily  qualified  to  mix\nThiopental.  Taylor’s expert’s opinions on these points was contradicted by the prison\nofficials’ expert, who testified that a board certified surgeon was well-qualified to set a\nfemoral  vein  IV  and  that  mixing  Thiopental  was  a  simple  process  of  mixing  two\ncontainers  prepackaged  by  the  manufacturer  that  could  be  easily  learned  through\ndemonstration and some practice.\nThe district court’s decisions regarding the need for testimony from, and about, the\ndoctor and nurse struck the proper balance between Taylor’s need for information and the\nprison officials defendants’ (and the medical personnel’s) concern that identifying the\ndoctor and nurse would result in their safety and security being put at risk from strident\ndeath penalty opponents.  These decisions did not unduly restrict Taylor’s ability to\nestablish his claims.  Whatever marginal relevance testimony from the medical personnel\nmay have had here, it was outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the defendants that would\nhave resulted and the ability of Taylor to provide comparable evidence from other\nwitnesses. \nSummary.  The district court’s decisions as to the challenged evidentiary matters\nwere very reasonable and cannot be disturbed as an abuse of discretion.\n41\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs shown above, the evidence in this case was more than sufficient to support the\njudgment of the district court and the district court’s evidentiary rulings were well-\nreasoned and well within its discretion.  Therefore, the prison official defendants urge this\nCourt to affirm the district court’s judgment that Missouri’s lethal injection procedure is\nconstitutional.  Taylor’s execution should also be allowed to proceed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEREMIAH W.

Larry\nCrawford, et al., No. 06-1278 (8th Cir. Feb. 1, 2006) (en banc).  After that court received a\ndecision from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, the panel\nvoted 2-1 to deny a stay.  The en banc court of appeals voted to grant a stay.  But it provided\nno reasoning for its decision.  \nProcedural History\nThe court is familiar with the procedural history of this case. \nNow, upon en banc review, the court of appeals issued the following order:\nAppellant Michael Anthony Taylor’s petition for rehearing en banc is\ngranted.  Appellant’s application for a stay of execution is granted.\nJudge Riley would deny the petition and deny the application for a stay.\n\nJudge Benton took no part in the vote in this matter.\nPetitioners now approach this court with a request that the court vacate the February\n1, 2006 stay of execution in Michael Taylor v. Larry Crawford, et al., No. 06-1379.  \nStandard of Review\nThis court set forth the standard of review in this situation in Bowersox v. Williams,\n517 U.S. 345 (1996).  \nA stay of execution pending disposition of the second or successive\nfederal habeas petition should be granted only when there are substantial\ngrounds upon which relief might be granted. . . . . Entry of a stay on a second\nor third habeas petition is a drastic measure, and we have held that it is\nparticularly egregious to enter a stay absent substantial grounds for relief.  \nId. at 346 (citations and quotation marks omitted).  In light of this standard of review, this\ncourt should vacate the lower court's stay of execution.  This standard, developed in a capital\nhabeas appeal context, similarly applies with stays issued in a civil rights litigation.   Gomez\nv. United States District Court, 503 U.S. 653, 653-54 (1992).  \nThe Court of Appeals' February 1, 2006 order is a summary order granting a stay of\nexecution.  It gives no explanation whatsoever.  Such  stays without explanation are rightly\ndisfavored.  Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U.S. at 346, citing Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U.S.\n951 (1995) (per curiam).  Reading the stay order in conjunction with the district court’s\nJanuary 31, 2006 judgment (Application Exhibit Q) shows no basis for a stay.  Respondent\nfails to show substantial grounds justifying issuance of a stay.  \n2\n\nIn Missouri, execution warrants are issued by the Missouri Supreme Court for a\nparticular date. See, e.g., Missouri Supreme Court order of January 3, 2006, and Warrant of\nExecution (Application Exhibits O and P).  See Delo v. Stokes, 495U.S. 320,110 S. Ct. 1880,\n1881 (1990).  They thus permit the execution to take place any time between 12:01a.m. and\n11:59 p.m.  The warrant expires shortly at 11:59 p.m. on February 1, 2006.  \nWhy The Stay Should Be Vacated\nThe court of appeals en banc order is unprecedented.  It declines to identify a\nsubstantial ground for the stay.  In fact, it declines to provide any reason for the stay.   During\nTimothy Johnston litigation and now the Michael Taylor litigation, Missouri has now proved\nto the satisfaction of two district judges that there is no basis for §1983 relief as to Missouri’s\nmethod-of-execution.  In contrast, Taylor can show no circuit or state court that has granted\nrelief.  This case is not a “substantial ground” for a stay.\nRespondent Taylor makes three claims in this case, which he filed as a § 1983 action.\nHe  first  challenges  Missouri’s  method  of  lethal  injection  as  violative  of  the  Eighth\nAmendment’s ban of cruel and unusual punishments.  He next claims that his due process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment will be violated because a physician will assist in\npreparations for the execution and such assistance by a physician is a violation of medical\nethics. Then, he asserts that lethal injection, as performed in Missouri, violates the Thirteenth\nAmendment in that it constitutes a badge of slavery.\nRespondent Taylor cannot succeed on the merits on any of these claims.\n3\n\nMissouri’s method and means of administration of lethal injection are not cruel\nand unusual.  The Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments that involve “‘unnecessary and\nwanton inflictions of pain.’” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S. Ct. 285, 290 (1976)\n(quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2925 (1976)). It also prohibits\nthose that are inconsistent with “evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.” Estelle, 429 U.S. at 102, 97 S. Ct. at 290 (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S.\n86, 100-01, 78 S. Ct. 590, 598 (1958). Any punishment must be consistent with human\ndignity and comply with current civilized standards. Trop, 356 U.S. at 96-102, 78 S. Ct. at\n597-98.\nMissouri is among 37 of the 38 states with the death penalty that use lethal injection\nas a method of execution.  See Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029, 1032 (9th Cir. 2004).\n“There is general agreement that lethal injection is at present the most humane type of\nexecution available and many states have abandoned other forms of execution in favor of\nlethal injection.”  Hill v. Lockhart, 791 F. Supp. 1388, 1394 (E.D. Ark. 1992).  See also\nLaGrand v. Lewis, 883 F. Supp. 469, 471 (D. Ariz. 1995) (citing cases that have affirmed the\nconstitutionality of lethal injection), aff’d, 133 F.3d 1253 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525\nU.S. 971, 119 S. Ct. 422 (1998).  Moreover, medical experts have urged that death by lethal\ninjection is more humane than previously used means of execution. See People v. Stewart,\n520 N.E.2d 348, 358 (Ill. 1998), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 900, 109 S. Ct. 246 (1988).\n4\n\nIn addition to this case law generally finding lethal injection to be a humane method\nof execution, Missouri’s particular method of lethal injection and means of administering the\ndrugs have recently been found to pass constitutional muster, in the district court decision\nhere (Application Exhibit Q), at pages 4-7, and in Johnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-1075\nCAS, slip op. at pp. 9-10 (E.D. Mo. August 26, 2005) (Application Exhibit A; “Johnston slip\nop.”).  In Johnston, the plaintiff raised the same two Eighth Amendment issues Taylor raises\nhere:\n(1) There is a significant risk that the sodium pentothal (also called thiopental sodium)\nadministered first in the execution process, either through administration by untrained\npersonnel or due to the amount administered, will not render the condemned prisoner\nunconscious until his death, with the result that he will be conscious and suffer pain from the\nadministration of pancuronium bromide (also called pavulon), which is the second drug\nadministered and which causes paralysis and suffocation, and of potassium chloride, which\nis the third drug administered and which causes pain as it goes through the veins before it\nreaches the heart and stops it.  (It was also asserted in Johnston, as here, that the paralysis\ncaused by the pancuronium bromide would render the inmate incapable of demonstrating\nthat he was conscious and experiencing pain.)  Johnston slip op. at p. 1; Taylor, slip op. at\n4-6.\n5\n\n(2) The administration of the three drugs used in the execution process into the\nfemoral vein by means of a triple lumen catheter causes undue pain.  Johnston slip op. at p.\n7; Taylor, slip op. at 6-7.\nWith regard to the first claim, Dr. Dershwitz, the defense expert, testified in the\nJohnston case that the 5 gram dose of sodium pentothal given in Missouri1 would render\nmost people unconscious within a few seconds and that by the time all 5 grams are injected\nover 99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious.   Johnston slip op. at p. 5;\nTestimony of Dr. Dershwitz (Application Exhibit D), at p. 18; Affidavit of Dr. Dershwitz\n(Application Exhibit E; also presented to the district court at the trial in this case as\nDefendants’ Exhibits 1-5), at ¶ 8.2  (Dr. Dershwitz also testified to the same effect yesterday\nin the hearing in this case.)  The Johnston court found that this testimony was essentially\nunrebutted by Dr. Heath, the plaintiff’s expert, in that he testified only that the dose of\nsodium pentothal would be insufficient only if it was administered incorrectly.  Johnston slip\nop. at pp. 5-6.  The court also noted that Dr. Heath had conceded in Beardslee v. Woodford,\n395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005), that a 5 gram dose of sodium pentothal, if administered\n1No changes in the means used in the execution of Johnston are anticipated for the\nexecution  of  respondent  Taylor.    Application  Exhibit  F  (Answer  to  Supplemental\nInterrogatory No. 18 (p. 2).\n2Dr. Dershwitz also explained that “[b]ecause these probability calculations by\ndefinition could never be 0 percent on one end or 100 percent on the other, we end up with\nprobabilities with a lot of nines in them because mathematically you cannot have in this type\nof  calculation  100  percent.    But  this  is  practically  speaking  a  dose  that  guarantees\nunconsciousness in everybody for a significant period of time.”  Exhibit D, at p. 18.\n6\n\nproperly, “would likely be sufficient to cause unconsciousness and probably death prior to\nthe administration of pancuronium bromide.”  Johnston slip op. at p. 5 (quoting Beardslee).\nWith regard to the possibility that an error in administration of the drugs could result in a risk\nof suffering, the court, citing Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463-65,\n67 S. Ct. 375, 376-77 (1947), ruled that such a “possibility of human error or accident is\ninsufficient to establish a constitutional violation.”  Johnston slip op. at p. 4; see also\nJohnston slip op. at p. 7; Taylor slip op. at p. 5.  It should also be noted that a 5 gram dose\nof sodium pentothal is 12.5 times the normal surgical dosage and would render most people\nunconscious for more than 13 hours.  See Beardslee, 395 F. 3d at 1075.  The district court\nhere properly concurred in those findings and conclusions.  Taylor slip op. at 5.\nAdditionally, the court in Johnston found the doctor and nurse involved in Missouri\nexecutions to be qualified.  Johnston slip op. at p. 7.  The court specifically noted the\nevidence that the doctor had prepared sodium pentothal (the only one of the three drugs that\nrequires mixing on site) 1000 times and had placed IV central lines 20,000 to 30,000 times.\nJohnston slip op. at p. 7 n.1.  This same doctor is expected to be involved in respondent\nTaylor’s  execution.    Defendant  Crawford’s  Answers  to  Plaintiffs’  Supplemental\nInterrogatories (Application Exhibit F), responses to Interrogatory No. 18 (p. 2), No. 22a (p.\n8), and 22c (p. 10).\nThe Johnston court also rejected the claim that administering the drugs through the\nfemoral vein with a triple lumen catheter was improper “because the mere possibility rather\n7\n\nthan any probability of the infliction of . . . pain, and because the possibility is dependent\nupon mistakes in the procedure involving accidental punctures and other complications not\nreasonably foreseeable and not constitutionally relevant.”  Johnston slip op. at p. 8.3  The\ncourt then specifically pointed out that the doctor performing the procedure in Missouri is\na board-certified surgeon and qualified to perform the procedure.  Johnston slip op. at p. 8.\nSee also Application Exhibit F, response to Supplemental Interrogatory No. 18 (p. 2) and No.\n22a (p. 8) (doctor expected to perform the procedure at Taylor’s execution, who is also\ndoctor that performed the procedure in the last five executions, is a board-certified surgeon).\n Similarly, the Taylor district court rejected this claim.  Taylor slip op. at 6. \nThe  court  in  Johnston  granted  summary  judgment  against  the  prisoner  on  the\nchallenge to Missouri’s means of lethal injection, stating:\nplaintiff’s proof, even if accepted as true and accurate, is insufficient to\nestablish the Eighth Amendment will be violated by Missouri’s lethal injection\nprotocol.  Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the opinions of plaintiff’s\nexpert are inadequate to rationally support a conclusion that his execution as\nplanned  carries  an  unconstitutional  risk  of  the  unnecessary  and  wanton\ninfliction of pain sufficient to violate standards of decency in the context of the\npurposeful and lawful extinguishment of life.\n3Petitioners Crawford and Purkett also note that one of respondent Taylor’s own\nexperts  here, Dr. Heath, provided an affidavit in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 645-647,\n124 S. Ct. 2117, 2124 (2004), that appears to have supported the use of a percutaneous\ncentral line as a proper means administration of the drugs in an execution.  A percutaneous\ncentral line is one inserted by “passage through the skin by needle puncture, including\nintroduction of wires and catheters.”  Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 1325 (26th ed. 1995)\n(definition of percutaneous).  This is the type of central line challenged by respondent Taylor\nas described in the Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 36) in ¶ 73.\n8\n\nJohnston slip op. at pp. 9-10.  See also Application Exhibit D, at p. 25 (Dr. Dershwitz\ntestified that “I think that if the protocol as described here is implemented, the likelihood that\nthe inmate will experience any suffering is negligible”); Application Exhibit E4, at ¶ 5 (Dr.\nDershwitz’s opinion that “a condemned inmate who is administered five grams of thiopental\nsodium will be rendered unconscious, and not experience pain, for the time period necessary\nto complete the execution”); Application Exhibit E, at ¶¶ 9-14 (Dr. Dershwitz’s opinions\nregarding the vanishingly small probabilities that a condemned inmate given a 5 gram dose\nof thiopental sodium could be conscious, and able to experience any pain associated with the\nsubsequent administration of pancuronium  bromide and potassium chloride); Taylor slip op.\nat 5.\nThe Eighth Amendment claims of respondent Taylor here (even assuming he has a\nvalid individualized method-of-execution § 1983 claim under Nelson, 541 U.S. at 644, 124\nS. Ct. at 2123) are no different from those already ruled in the Johnston case.  Taylor has\noffered no facts here different than the facts that existed in Johnston, which the court\nconcluded were insufficient to state a claim as a matter of law.5  In this absence of any\n4Exhibit E was admitted as Defendants’ Exhibits 1-5 before the district court.\n5Johnston’s general approval of Missouri’s lethal injection procedure also precludes\nany argument by respondent Taylor that the chance of error in his execution could render that\nprocedure constitutionally infirm in his particular case.  The Supreme Court has rejected\nconstitutional challenges based on an “‘unforeseeable accident,’ and has presumed that state\nofficials [will act] ‘in a careful and humane manner.’”  Beardslee, 395 F.3d at 1075 (quoting\nLouisiana Ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 461-463, 67 S. Ct. 374, 375 & 376\n(1947)).  “The risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution process\nin order to survive constitutional review.”  Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir.\n9\n\nlegitimate contention by Taylor contradicting the petitioner prison officials’ demonstration\nthat Missouri’s means of execution does not gratuitously inflict pain, the stay of execution\nhere should be vacated.  Taylor has no chance of success on the merits of the claim he raises\nhere.\nFurther, with regard to the Eighth Amendment claims here, petitioners Crawford and\nPurkett note that the drugs used in Missouri’s lethal injection process, have also been\napproved, either in the context of rulings on the merits or on requests for injunctive relief or\nstays, by many other courts.  Beardslee, 395 F.3d at 1076 (denial of stay and injunctive\nrelief); Cooper, 379 F.3d at 1033 (denial of stay and injunctive relief); In re Williams, 359\nF.3d 811, 813-14 (6th Cir. 2004) (denial of stay and injunctive relief); Abdur’Rahman v.\nBredesen, 2004 WL 2246227, at *15-*18 (Tenn. Ct. App., October 6, 2004) (decision on\nmerits), aff’d, 2005 WL 2615801, at *9-*13 (Tenn. Oct 17, 2005) (affirmed on the merits);\nReid v. Johnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543, 552-54 (E.D.

None of these courts found a\nsubstantial ground to justify a stay-of-execution.\n1994); State v. Webb, 750 A.2d 448, 455 (Conn. 2000).  See also Cooper, 379 F.3d at 1033;\nReid v. Johnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543, 551 (E.D. Va. 2004).\n10\n\nRespondent Taylor’s  past contentions that there was no full hearing on the merits in\nthe Johnston case disregards the evidentiary hearing held in that case on August 26, 2005.\nSee Application Exhibit D.  Johnston had the opportunity to produce evidence in support of\nthe contention that Missouri’s method of execution would result in the infliction of gratuitous\npain and did so fully through documentary evidence.  Id. at 5.  See also Application Exhibit\nA (references throughout to opinions of Johnston’s expert).  Johnston’s lawyer also had a full\nand fair opportunity at the hearing to cross-examine the state’s expert.  Application Exhibit\nD, pp. 34-54.  And now Taylor has had his own hearing, and the district court found his\nclaims meritless (Application Exhibit Q).  \nAs in Johnston, Respondent Taylor produced nothing to contradict the evidence that\nthe  5  gram  dose  of  sodium  pentothal  given  in  Missouri  would  render  most  people\nunconscious within a few seconds and that by the time all 5 grams are injected over\n99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious.  Application Exhibit A, at p. 5;\nTestimony of Dr. Dershwitz (Application Exhibit D), at p. 18; Affidavit of Dr. Dershwitz\n(Application Exhibit E), at ¶ 8.  Nor did he suggest that given more time, he might find such\nevidence.\nRespondent Taylor’s past suggestion that the sufficiency of the level of sodium\npentothal administered is “belied” by the use of pancuronium bromide to “mask symptoms”\nof an inadequate level of anesthesia is incorrect.  First, in making this point Taylor does not\neven attempt to refute the evidence of Dr. Dershwitz that 99.9999999% of the population\n11\n\nwould be unconscious after the administration of the sodium pentothal.  Second, petitioners\nCrawford and Purkett explained the reasons for use of pancuronium bromide in their\ndiscovery responses.  This drug mitigates the seizure activity and other involuntary bodily\nmovements that will commonly result from use of sodium pentothal and potassium chloride\nalone and thus will result in a more peaceful, dignified, solemn, and humane death of the\ncondemned prisoner.  Application Exhibit F, at pp. 13-14.\nRespondent Taylor has also suggested that there is some contradiction between the\nprison officials’ own statistics that “death does not occur until after the administration of the\nthird  chemical”  and  “the  contrary  contention  of  their  expert.”    Taylor  appears  to  be\nperceiving a contradiction between Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony that the administration of 5\ngrams of sodium pentothal will cause most persons to stop breathing within a minute of drug\nadministration (Application Exhibit E, at ¶ 8) and a table provided in discovery showing that\n2 to 5 minutes pass between the time of the injection of the first drug and the time of death\n(Defendant Crawford’s Supplemental Answer to Plaintiffs’ Interrogatory No. 6n; Application\nExhibit J6).  As can be seen by the explanation of “Time of Death” in Application Exhibit J,\nthere is no discrepancy here because death is pronounced based on electrical activity of the\nheart, not based on when breathing stops.\n6The initial response to Interrogatory 6n did not include the explanation of “Time of\nDeath” included at the end of the supplemental response.  The supplemental response was\nprovided shortly after respondent Taylor raised his contention that the table contradicted Dr.\nDershwitz’s testimony.\n12\n\nPhysician’s role in executions does not violate due process.  Respondent Taylor\nasserts that his right to due process will be violated if a physician has a role in the execution\nprocess because such a role by a physician violates medical ethics and thereby his “legitimate\nexpectation that a physician will not use his or her special skills and position of trust to kill\nrather than treat.”  Amended Complaint, ¶ 84 (Doc. No. 36).  The district court found the\nclaim meritless as a matter of law.  Taylor slip op. at 7.  There is no substantial ground for\nissuance of a stay.\nRespondent Taylor cites the Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association to\nsupport his claim that physician involvement in the execution process is a breach of medical\nethics.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 81.  But, it is not the AMA Code of Ethics that governs the\nconduct of physicians in Missouri.  See Chapter 334, RSMo (§ 334.100 sets out ethical\nstandards).  The petitioner prison officials have searched for, but been unable to find, any\ninterpretation of medical ethics imposed upon physicians in Missouri that would prohibit the\nphysician from having a role in the execution process.  A California court, however, has\nexamined this issue with regard to California law and determined that physician involvement\nin executions does not constitute unprofessional conduct.  Thorburn v. Department of\nCorrections, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 584, 590-91 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998).  \nRespondent Taylor here fails to establish a premise of his argument – physician\ninvolvement in executions is a violation of ethics in Missouri.  In fact, such involvement is\nquite consistent with medical ethics.  Physician involvement shows the medical profession’s\n13\n\ncompassion for all, including those sentenced to death.  By their involvement, physicians are\npromoting the basic medical tenet of easing pain and suffering by doing what they can to\nmake executions as humane as possible.\nEven if physician involvement in Missouri executions were prohibited as unethical\nconduct, respondent Taylor still has not stated a claim.  The claim that death-sentenced\ninmates have a “legitimate expectation that a physician will not use his or her special skills\nand position of trust to kill rather than treat” is incongruous in the context in which it is\nraised here.  Logically, an inmate sentenced to death would have no legitimate expectation\nthat anyone involved in the execution would direct any of his or her skills toward diminishing\nthe likelihood of death.  \nFurther, as the court in Abdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 2004 WL 2246227, at *8 n.45\n(Tenn. Ct. App., Oct. 6, 2004), aff’d, 2005 WL 2615801 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2005), stated:  \nWere [medical licensing] requirements applicable to executions by lethal\ninjection, the Department’s ability to carry out its statutory mandates would be\nundermined because many licensed medical professionals would decline to\nparticipate in the procedure.  It was for this reason that the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt noted that “no public policy is violated by allowing physicians or anyone\nelse to participate in carrying out a lawful sentence.”  Coe v. Sundquist, No.\nM2000-00897-SC-R9-CV (Tenn. Order Apr. 19, 2000).\n2004 WL 2246227, at *9.  Where public policy is not violated by a physician having a role\nin the execution process (even where such a role might be inconsistent with the ethical\npronouncements of a professional regulating body), it cannot be said, as respondent Taylor\ncontends, that there is any legitimate expectation that a physician will not have a role in\n14\n\nexecutions.  Without such a legitimate expectation, Taylor has no due process right that is\nconstitutionally protected.  See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, 442\nU.S. 1, 7, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 2103-04 (1979).\nFurther, at least in the prison disciplinary context, state created liberty interests giving\nrise to due process rights are generally limited to those that impose “atypical and significant\nhardship.”  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 2300 (1995).  Respondent\nTaylor’s claim here that he has some sort of protected right that a physician not have a role\nin the execution process fails under the Sandin standard because the presence of a physician\nat his executions will not cause him any hardship at all, much less one that is atypical and\nsignificant.  The presence of a physician may, on the contrary, be a benefit to Taylor. \nAs the district court concluded, Taylor slip op. at p. 7 and 9, Taylor fails to show\neither that Missouri physicians who are involved in the lethal injection process are violating\ntheir ethical obligations or that physician’s involvement violates a condemned prisoner’s due\nprocess rights.  He has no likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.  The court of\nappeals did not identify this issue as a substantial ground to justify a stay-of-execution.\nMissouri’s  method  of  lethal  execution  does  not  violate  the  Thirteenth\nAmendment.  Respondent Taylor contends that Missouri’s method of lethal injection\nconstitutes a vestige and badge of slavery and therefore violates the Thirteenth Amendment.\nAmended Complaint, ¶ 124.  The district court found this claim too meritless as a matter of\nlaw, Taylor slip op. at 7-8.  This is not a substantial ground for issuance of a stay.  \n15\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment provides: \nNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the\nUnited States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added.)  The Thirteenth Amendment does not apply here because this case\ninvolves  neither  slavery  nor  involuntary  servitude.    Even  if  it  did,  the  Amendment\nspecifically makes exception for instances in which a person is being punished for a crime.\nRespondent Taylor here falls within this exception.  See Wendt v. Lynaugh, 841 F.2d 619,\n620 (5th Cir. 1988) (plaintiff who has been convicted of a crime in no position to claim a\nright  under  the  Thirteenth  Amendment  because  exempted  by  precise  words  from  its\napplication ); Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1966) (“Thirteenth Amendment\nhas no bearing on the legality of the imprisonment of persons duly convicted of a crime; such\npersons are explicitly excepted from the Amendment’s coverage”); Draper v. Rhay, 315 F.2d\n193, 197 (9th Cir. 1963) (“Thirteenth Amendment has no application where a person is held\nto answer of a violation of a penal statute”).\nMoreover, a difference in treatment based on race is required to establish a claim\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment of imposition of a “badge of slavery.”  See Jones v. Alfred\nH. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 445, 88 S. Ct. 2186, 2206 (1968).  Missouri’s method of\nexecution is used on condemned prisoners of all races.  Therefore, it cannot be considered\nas a “badge of slavery.”  This ground is not a substantial ground for issuance of a stay-of-\nexecution.\n16\n\nEffect of Recent Capital Litigation\nThe recent grant of certiorari in Hill v. Crosby, No. 05-8794 (U.S. S. Ct., Jan. 25,\n2006), does not support Taylor’s argument here that his execution is properly barred.\nAlthough the Hill case does arise from claims regarding the constitutionality of Florida’s\nmethod of lethal injection, the questions on which certiorari was granted are procedural only\nand have no bearing on the question here of whether respondent Taylor has established a\nsufficient basis on which to support an order to prohibit his execution.  The questions\npresented in the petition for certiorari in Hill were:\n1. Whether a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by a death-\nsentenced state prisoner, who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue a\nchallenge to the chemicals utilized for carrying out the execution, is properly\nrecharacterized as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254?\n2. Whether, under this Court’s decision in Nelson, a challenge to a\nparticular  protocol  the  State  plans  to  use  during  the  execution  process\nconstitutes a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983?\nHill v. Crosby Petition for Certiorari, p. i.  These questions merely address the proper\nprocedural vehicle by which to challenge a specific method of execution.  The lower courts\nin Hill addressed only the question of jurisdiction, found it wanting, and never considered\nthe means of execution.  Hill v. Crosby, No. 4:06-CV-032-SPM (N.D. Fla., Jan. 21, 2006)\n(claim denied for lack of jurisdiction) (Application Exhibit H); Hill v. Crosby, No.06-10621\n(11th Cir., Jan. 24, 2006) (denying stay of execution due to district court’s lack of jurisdiction\nto hear case in first instance) (Application Exhibit I).  This Court’s interest in Hill does not\n17\n\nappear to arise from any question as to the method of execution,7 but rather from an intent\nto better define the circumstances in which method of execution claims may be pursued as\nclaims under § 1983, an issue expressly left open in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644,\n124 S. Ct. 2117, 2123 (2004).\nHere, petitioners and the lower courts have proceeded as if the Hill issue had been\ndecided in Taylor’s favor.  And with good reason:  The procedural question in Hill was ruled\nagainst Crawford and Purkett in the Johnston litigation.  Johnston v. Crawford, 2005 WL\n1474022, at *2 (W.D. Mo. 2005).  Thereafter the prison officials demonstrated at a hearing\nthat the method was humane.  Application Exhibits A and D.  Petitioners do not concede that\nthe procedural ruling in Johnston was correct.  But rather than delay proceeding by arguing\nagainst it, they have presented – and now in the expedited proceedings ordered by the Eighth\nCircuit, recreated – the Johnston record.  The conclusion in Johnston that Missouri’s\nexecution process is lawful, reconfirmed here by the district court, is not called into question\nby the grant of review on the procedural question in Hill.  \nEven if Taylor is correct that this case properly remains a § 1983 action, the order\nbarring his execution was still an abuse of the court’s discretion.  It is an abuse of discretion\n7Even if the Court’s interest were the method of execution, it should be noted that the\nmethod of execution in Florida provides for the administration of no less than 2 grams of\nsodium pentothal, Hill v. State, 2006 WL 91302, at footnote 3, while Missouri’s method of\nexecution provides for the administration of 5 grams of that drug.  Exhibit D, at p. 12;\nExhibit E, at ¶ 4B.\n18\n\nbecause the underlying claims here are meritless.  Whichever form of action is proper, the\nstay of Taylor’s execution should be vacated and that execution allowed to proceed.\nThis view of Hill seems confirmed by this Court’s recent denial of certiorari in\nBieghler v. Indiana, No. 05-8824 (Jan. 26, 2006).  Mr. Bieghler raised a claim against the\nsame three-drug sequence used in executions as does respondent Taylor in this case.  Indiana,\nlike Missouri petitioners here, did not rest on a challenge Mr. Bieghler’s use of the § 1983\nas a remedial vehicle (Application Exhibit K).  The district court declined to enjoin Mr.\nBieghler’s execution (Application Exhibit K).  The Seventh Circuit, voting 2-1, ordered a\ndelay  in  the  execution  (Application  Exhibit  L),  but  this  Court  overturned that  order\n(Application Exhibit M) and the execution proceeded.\nGiven where it has led, respondent Taylor’s claim here should have been pursued in\na habeas action.  But that is not an issue petitioners raise in seeking for vacation of the stay\norder, because even if this case is properly pursued under § 1983, the order prohibiting\nTaylor’s execution still constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Again, as shown in the Johnston\nproceedings, discussed above, and by the district court order yesterday in this case, Missouri\nprovides a humane method of execution that does not inflict any gratuitous pain on the\ncondemned.  The showing made by petitioners here goes beyond that shown in the Bieghler\nproceedings.\nThis Court’s vacation of the stay entered in Bieghler seems to demonstrate that its\ngrant of certiorari in Hill case was based on a view that there was a need to resolve the\n19\n\nquestion left open in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2123 (2004),\nof when a method-of-execution claim should be brought in a habeas or civil rights suit.\nWhile that issue has been raised here, petitioners have also gone past that issue and\nestablished  that  Missouri’s  execution  process  does  not  constitute  cruel  and  unusual\npunishment.  Resolution of the questions in Hill will not have any ultimate impact on\nTaylor’s claims here.\nInterests of the Parties and the Public\nTo the extent that the Court considers an assessment of the interests of the parties and\nthe public appropriate here, the balance of those interests favors vacation of the stay of\nexecution.  The potential harm to respondent Taylor to be assessed is not whether his death\nwill be the result of his execution, for he asserts that he is not challenging the fact of his\ndeath sentence.  He is challenging the means of his execution.  Thus, the harm to Taylor for\nthe Court to consider here is the harm to him from execution by means of Missouri’s three-\ndrug process.  In other words, will Taylor’s execution as planned cause him significant pain\nthat is unnecessary?  See Reid, 333 F. Supp. 2d at 551.  As shown above by the decision in\nJohnston v. Crawford, and by the district court’s order, and by the testimony of Dr.\nDershwitz, respondent Taylor’s execution by Missouri’s three-drug process is humane and\nwill not result in any significant discomfort.\nThe harm to others and the public interest that results from an order barring Taylor’s\nexecution on February 1, 2006, is the harm to the family of the victim and the harm to\n20\n\nMissouri’s public policy that would result in an interference with the imposition of the just\npunishment of Taylor.  The state of Missouri has determined that the death penalty is\nappropriate in certain circumstances.  Those circumstances were found to exist in this case8\nand respondent Taylor was sentenced to death.  State v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo. banc\n1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1152, 117 S. Ct. 1088 (1997).  He has now pursued his post-\nconviction remedies and his conviction and sentence of death have been approved.  States\nhave  “a  significant  interest  in  meting  out  a  sentence  of  death  in  a  timely  fashion.”\nNelson,541 U.S. at 644, 124 S. Ct. at 2123.  See also Gomez, 503 U.S. at 654, 112 S. Ct. at\n1653; In re Blodgett, 502 U.S. 236, 239, 112 S. Ct. 674, 676 (1992).  Stopping Taylor’s\nexecution now, based on unfounded assertions of inhumanity in Missouri’s execution\nprocess, would interfere with the victim’s family’s ability to obtain closure and with the\nstate’s policy that crimes such as Taylor’s call for the ultimate punishment.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, petitioners pray that this court vacate the court of appeals'\nlatest order granting a stay of execution in Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-1379WMJC (8th Cir.\nFeb. 1, 2006).  Vacating the stay will vindicate once again the conclusion of a competent\n8Respondent Taylor and an accomplice kidnapped a 15-year old girl while she was\nwaiting for a school bus, bound and blindfolded the girl, threatened her with death, raped her,\nput her in the trunk of their car, and then stabbed her repeatedly with kitchen knives.  The girl\nprobably lived for 30 minutes after she was stabbed.  State v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209, 214\n(Mo. banc 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1088 (1997).\n21\n\nfinder of fact that the execution method chosen by Missouri and 37 other states does not\nviolate constitutional strictures.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEREMIAH W.

Response at 2 (“[We] ask the \nCourt to reconsider its conclusion that [the July 14] protocol is not constitutionally sufficient.”).  \nThe State’s refusal even to attempt to comply with -- or litigate -- the Court’s remedial order is \nyet more evidence that the State does not comprehend what is at stake in this litigation.   \n  An execution procedure that involves an unnecessary risk of significant pain violates the \nEighth Amendment.  See Order of June 26, 2006, at 10-11.

Missouri, \nCentral Division. \nMichael Anthony TAYLOR, Plaintiff, \nv. \nLarry CRAWFORD, et al., Defendants. \nNo. 05-4173-CV-W-FJG. | May 5, 2006. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nDonald B.

GAITAN, JR., District Judge. \n*1 Currently pending before the Court is plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60 (Doc. # 98). \n  \n \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis case was remanded from the Eighth Circuit on April 27, 2006 for the limited purpose of permitting a continuation of the \nhearing held on January 30-31, 2006. The Court held a teleconference with the parties on May 1, 2006 to discuss the status of \nthe case. The Court advised the parties that it would be helpful if they could provide to the Court an outline of the discovery \nwhich they wished to conduct. The Court notified the parties that another conference would be scheduled the following day. \nOn May 2, 2006, plaintiff provided to the Court the requested discovery outline. The filing also indicated defendant’s \nposition with regard to each of the categories of discovery. \n  \nPlaintiff proposed the following: 1) a Rule 34 Inspection of the facility where Mr. Taylor will be executed; 2) Depositions of \nLarry Crawford (current head of Missouri Department of Corrections); Dr. Mark Dershwitz; Joe Doe No. 1 (who assists in \nexecutions); John Doe No. 2 (nurse who assists with executions); John Does 3-10; and a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of the \nindividual who chooses the execution procedure for each execution; 3) Twenty-seven different document requests (including \nsub-parts). Additionally, plaintiff also planned to submit to the defendants interrogatories and requests for admission by \nThursday May 4, 2006. \n  \nIn advance of the teleconference, the Court issued an Order on May 2 which limited the discovery which plaintiff sought. \nPlaintiff has now filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration of the Order limiting discovery. Plaintiff in his Motion states \nthat the Court should reconsider its prior Order because 1) it is inconsistent with the Eighth Circuit’s opinion and 2) the \ndiscovery is highly relevant and so central to the merits of his case that denial of the discovery would violate due process. \n  \n \n  1 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Eighth Circuit’s Opinion \nPlaintiff believes that he is entitled to present whatever witnesses and evidence might possibly be relevant to support his case. \nHe states that he is not asking for an entirely new hearing, but rather for the opportunity, to “expand or supplement the \nrecord” with any additional evidence that may shed light on the legal issues at hand. Additionally, plaintiff states that the \nEighth Circuit’s opinion was extremely clear that additional discovery may be warranted and that this Court should use its \ndiscretion in deciding what discovery is open to the parties. Plaintiff states that the Court did not exercise its discretion \nsoundly by ruling on the scope of the discovery without allowing argument by the parties beforehand. \n  \nThe State responds that the Court’s Order is consistent with the Eighth Circuit’s instructions on remand to permit “some \nfurther opportunity for discovery [as] may be warranted.” Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-1397, 2006 WL 1098173, *4 (8th Cir. \nApr. 27, 2006). The State suggests that by establishing a thirty day time deadline for the completion of any discovery, the \nEighth Circuit did not intend to grant plaintiff an unfettered opportunity to conduct whatever discovery he desired. \n  \n*2 In reply, plaintiff states that he is not seeking to wipe out the discovery which has already been conducted, but is instead \nonly seeking to add to the record. Plaintiff also states that he is not seeking to expand the thirty day time frame established by \nthe Eighth Circuit. He argues that if the Eighth Circuit had not intended to allow any additional discovery, they could have \nordered only a thirty day period to prepare for and conduct the hearing. \n  \nThe Court in reviewing the requested discovery found it to be overly expansive. The parties must be mindful that this case \nwas initially filed on June 3, 2005. Some discovery had taken place before the case was appealed to the Eighth Circuit. The \nCourt was simply exercising its discretion in determining what discovery is relevant and can realistically be accomplished \nwithin the time frame established. \n  \n \nB. Relevance of Discovery \n1. Depositions of John Doe Defendants \nSecondly, plaintiff argues that several of his requests are extremely relevant to presenting his case. For example, plaintiff \nargues it is crucial that he be able to depose John Doe No. 1-the doctor who inserts the femoral catheter, as his argument is \nthat this procedure is extremely risky, poses a serious risk of infection and violates the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiff argues it \nis important to depose this person to discover their qualifications and also to determine if they are a certified anesthesiologist \ntrained to administer anesthetic depth. As alleged in his Complaint, plaintiff argues that if the first chemical is not \nadministered correctly, it fails to anesthetize the inmate completely and he could suffer excruciating pain as a result of the \nother two chemicals. Additionally, plaintiff argues that depositions of the other medical personnel would also lead to crucial \ninformation, i.e. the person who mixes the chemicals and their qualifications, the person who actually pushes the plunger, and \nthe identity of John Doe No. 4, the only person in the room during the actual execution. \n  \nThe State argues that disclosure of the identity of these individuals would be inappropriate because of security concerns for \nthe prison and for these individuals. \n  \nPlaintiff responds that it is critical to depose these individuals and that interrogatories are not sufficient, because it is crucial \nto be able to ask follow up questions. Plaintiff states that a Protective Order would more than adequately protect the security \ninterests of the State. Additionally, plaintiff notes that it might be possible to conduct anonymous in person depositions, so as \nnot to disclose the identity of these individuals. \n  \nThe Court determines that plaintiff should first submit interrogatories to these individuals. If the responses received are not \nadequate to answer plaintiff’s questions, plaintiff may seek leave from the Court to conduct anonymous depositions. \n  \n \n2. Deposition of Dr. Dershwitz \nPlaintiff also argues that it is crucial to be able to depose Dr. Dershwitz, because the State’s entire case rests on his accuracy \nand credibility. Plaintiff argues that his counsel did not have a proper opportunity to cross examine Dr. Dershwitz during the \nprevious hearing in January. Plaintiff states that it is necessary that he be deposed because his scientific conclusions and \n  2 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \ngraphs have never been publically challenged and his assumptions underlying this evidence are fatally flawed. Plaintiff also \nargues that it is essential that he receive any records of Missouri executions dating back to 1989, because these records may \ncontradict Dr. Dershwitz’s assertions that an inmate will stop breathing within one minute of the administration of thiopental \nand that death results within one minute of the administration of potassium chloride. Plaintiff argues that there are reasons to \nbelieve that Missouri execution records dating back to 1989 would disprove Dr. Dershwitz’s assertions in this regard. \n  \n*3 The State asserts that there is no reason to depose Dr. Dershwitz at this point in time, as he has already testified in the \nhearing and plaintiff had an opportunity to cross-examine him regarding his views. A deposition of Dr. Dershwitz would add \nnothing new to what is already in the record. \n  \nThe Court agrees that there is no need to conduct a full deposition of Dr. Dershwitz at this point in time. The Court would \nconsider allowing a limited deposition of Dr. Dershwitz if plaintiff could demonstrate that there were some specific points \nwhich he was not allowed to cover in the previous hearing, or if for example, there are records which the State produces \nwhich he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Dershwitz about earlier. If plaintiff believes this to be the case, he \nmay submit to the Court a list of questions which he would like to ask Dr. Dershwitz. However, the Court will not allow a \nfull deposition of Dr. Dershwitz addressing issues on which he previously testified. \n  \n \n3. Past Execution Records \nPlaintiff also argues that it is necessary to allow him access to documents relating to Missouri executions dating back to \n1989. Plaintiff states these documents would show what changes which have been made in the lethal injection procedures \nover the years in order to determine what type of complications have arisen and whether the State has acted with the \nnecessary level of care. Plaintiff argues that his document requests are narrowly tailored to provide this critical information \nand seek documents pertaining to only 66 executions. At the very least, he requests that the Court grant his request for \ndocuments dating back to January 1, 1995, as that is when the State stopped using the Leuchter machine for administering \nlethal injections. Thus, he argues that the procedures from 1995 forward are relevant to the procedures currently employed by \nthe State. \n  \nThe State argues that documents going back more than the last six executions are of little or no relevance and are too remote \nin time to be of assistance to plaintiff in this case. The State notes that plaintiff’s argument is that the execution process is \ncurrently flawed, and what that process is will be fully reflected in the material from the last six executions. \n  \nPlaintiff argues that the State has previously acknowledged that executions from 2000 to the present are relevant and \ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence because revisions to the execution protocol regarding the lethal \ninjection process have not been made since 2000. \n  \nThe Court disagrees and finds that information relating to the last six executions is more than sufficient to provide the \nplaintiff with relevant data which is not too remote in time. \n  \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration (Doc. # 98). \n  \n \n \n  3 \n ",

GAITAN, JR., District Judge. \n*1 Currently pending before the Court is plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider Limitations on the Deposition of John Doe No. 1 \n(Doc. # 168). Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider the following limitations which the Court has placed on the deposition of \nJohn Doe No. 1: 1) two hour time limitation to depose John Doe No. 1; 2) allowing only one attorney to be present at the \ndeposition and 3) limiting the questioning to only the three areas referenced by the Court. The Court will address each of \nthese areas in turn. \n  \n \n1. Time Limitation \nPlaintiff states that Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(d)(2) unequivocally entitles all parties to depositions lasting seven hours. Plaintiff argues \nthat there is no good cause for the Court to curtail the deposition of John Doe No. 1 and there is no evidence in the record that \nplaintiff intends to harass John Doe No. 1 or has harassed any other party in this case. Plaintiff also states that there has been \nno showing in this case that the parties have conducted themselves in a manner that would require the Court’s supervision. \nThe Court disagrees. Plaintiff’s counsel has shown through its voluminous motions, letters and other correspondence to the \nCourt that they are unable to restrain themselves. Upon review of the proposed questions, this Court has determined that the \nissues plaintiff wishes to cover in the deposition can reasonably be asked in two hours. If during the deposition the Court \nfinds that more than two hours is needed, additional time may be allowed. Plaintiff’s counsel are also advised that they will \nonly be allowed to cover on redirect examination, areas of inquiry which were raised by defendant on cross-examination. \n  \n \n2. Limitation on Attorneys Who May Attend \nPlaintiff also argues that the Court has no good cause to limit the number of attorneys who attend the deposition. Plaintiff \nwishes to have two attorneys present, one who will depose the witness and a second attorney who would “second chair” the \ndeposition. The Court disagrees and finds that there is no reason to have multiple attorneys present during the deposition of \nthis witness. Counsel for plaintiff have obviously given a great deal of thought to the questions which they wish to ask this \nwitness, and additionally a transcript will be available for any counsel who wish to review it. In light of the security concerns \npresent regarding this witness, the Court finds that limiting the number of people involved is a reasonable step to take. \n  \n \n3. Limitation on the Substantive Issues \nPlaintiff’s counsel also raise again their disagreement with the limitations on discovery which this Court has placed upon \nthem. Plaintiff argues that the Eighth Circuit placed no substantive limitations on the issues which Plaintiff was entitled to \nexplore or the evidence that he could collect. Plaintiff is correct, the Eighth Circuit did not place any limitations, but rather \n  1 \n \n\nTaylor v. Crawford, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2006)   \n \nleft the question of what discovery and how much discovery should be allowed up to the discretion of this Court. The Eighth \nCircuit stated: “we remand for the limited purpose of permitting a continuation of the hearing held on January 30-31, 2006, \nbefore Judge Gaitan. While we conclude that some further opportunity for discovery may be warranted, we leave all matters \nof what further discovery may be warranted to Judge Gaitan....” Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-1397, 2006 WL 1098173, *4 \n(8th Cir. Apr. 27, 2006). Plaintiff’s counsel have continually treated this case as if it has just been filed. While the Court \nrecognizes that the current counsel did not enter their appearance in the case until recently, the case has been on file for \nalmost a year and this Court has already conducted a two day hearing in January of this year. Plaintiff’s counsel are not \nentitled to turn back the clock and start at the beginning. This Court has done what the Eighth Circuit directed, and allowed \nthe parties an opportunity to conduct some limited discovery on the issues which are central and critical to this case in the \ntime which was allowed by the Court’s Order. However, the Court will allow plaintiff to use his two hours to cover any of \nthe questions previously submitted for its review, subject to appropriate objections. \n  \n*2 Therefore, plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider the Limitations On the Deposition of John Doe No. 1 is hereby GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part. (Doc. # 168). \n  \n \n \n  2 \n ",

Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  When applying this\nstandard, the court accepts as true the factual allegations in the complaint and views them in\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Hishon v. King and Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73\n(1984); Kohl v. Casson, 5 F.3d 1141, 1148 (8th Cir. 1993). \nDefendants first state that the claims raised by plaintiffs should be brought pursuant to\nhabeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254.  However, in this case, plaintiffs do not ask to have their\nsentences set aside, shortened or changed; they merely challenge the method of execution on\nthe grounds, among others, that it is cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution because it inflicts unnecessary pain.  Because it is a challenge\nto the method of execution, not the fact or timing of execution, it is not a habeas claim; rather,\n\na claim under the Eighth Amendment, which can properly be brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983.  See, e.g., Nelson v. Campbell, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 2117 (2004); Wilkenson v.\nDotson, ___ U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 1242 (2005).\nDefendants next challenge this case, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, on the grounds\nthat plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, as required by the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997(e)(a).  Although defendants submit documentation\nthat suggests this issue can be grieved to the Department of Corrections’ grievance procedure,\nthe failure to exhaust the grievance procedure is not jurisdictional.  Furthermore, the issues in\nthis case are similar, if not identical, to those raised in Johnson v. Crawford, No. 04-1075\n(E.D. Mo. 2005), which was resolved in favor of defendants.  If defendants had any\nwillingness or desire to change the method of execution because of the pain inflicted, they\nwould have done so in that case, and can do so anytime they see fit.  Forcing plaintiffs to file a\ngrievance would be a futile act.  This court will not dismiss for failure to exhaust futile\ngrievance procedures. \nDefendants also claim that the method of execution is not cruel and unusual.  That\nclaim goes to the merits and will likely be decided on a motion for summary judgment or after\na hearing, but is premature on a motion to dismiss, given the allegations in plaintiffs’\ncomplaint.  \nDefendants’ other allegations of why this case should be dismissed lack merit.  \nIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied [38].  \n/s/Scott O. Wright                                  \nSCOTT O. WRIGHT\nSenior United States District Judge\nDated: 12-28-05\n2",

The crux of Taylor’s\nargument is that the first chemical administered, thiopental, may not render him\nunconscious before and during the administration of the second two chemicals,\npancuronium  bromide  and  potassium  chloride.    Taylor  asserts  that,  after  the\npancuronium  bromide  disables  him  from  moving  (its  intended  purpose),  the\nadministration of potassium chloride (intended to stop his heart) may cause him pain\nif the thiopental has not had its intended anesthetic effect.\nUnder  Missouri’s  three-chemical  procedure,  however,  the  thiopental  is\nadministered in an amount large enough that even Taylor’s expert witness agreed a\ncondemned prisoner would be quickly rendered so deeply unconscious that he would\nnot be aware of any pain from the succeeding chemicals and would remain at that\nlevel of unconsciousness for a length of time that is longer than required for the\ncompletion of the execution.\nThe  defendant-appellee  prison  officials  request  twenty  minutes  for  oral\nargument.\n1\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSUMMARY AND REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nTABLE OF CONTENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . 2\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . 5\nISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . 12\nProcedural History of Criminal Case . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\nFacts of Criminal Case . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . 14\nProcedural History of this Case . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\nStatement of Facts Regarding Lethal Injection Procedure . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . 26\nARGUMENT\nI.

Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2005); \nAmerican Medical Association’s Code of Ethics, E-2.06\n11\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nProcedural History of Criminal Case.  Taylor was charged by indictment in\nthe Circuit Court of Jackson County, State of Missouri, with one count of murder in\nthe first degree, in violation of §565.020, RSMo. 1994; one count of the felony of\narmed criminal action, in violation of §571.015, RSMo. 1994; one count of the Class\nB felony of kidnaping, in violation of §565.110, RSMo. 1994; and one count of the\nfelony of forcible rape, in violation of §566.030, RSMo. Cum. Supp. 1993.\nOn February 8, 1991, Taylor appeared with his attorneys before the Honorable\nAlvin C. Randall and expressed his desire to enter a plea of guilty to these charges in\nopen court and on the record pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.01(b).\nAfter a three day punishment phase hearing, Judge Randall sentenced Taylor to death.\nTaylor  also  received  sentences  of  life  imprisonment  for  rape,  fifteen  years\nimprisonment for kidnaping, and ten years imprisonment for armed criminal action,\nall terms to run consecutively.  \nTaylor brought a post-conviction action pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court\nRule 24.035, challenging his guilty plea and sentence.  After an extensive evidentiary\nhearing the circuit court denied Taylor's post-conviction motion.  \nTaylor filed an appeal challenging the guilty plea, the imposition of the death\npenalty and the denial of the Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief, and\n12\n\nargued to the Missouri Supreme Court some fifteen claims of error.  The Missouri\nSupreme Court issued the following order on June 29, 1993:\nORDER\nJudgment vacated.  Cause remanded for new penalty hearing,\nimposition of sentence, and entry of new judgment.  \nTaylor's second punishment phase hearing before Judge Michael Coburn began\non May 2, 1994.  Initially, Judge Coburn heard evidence for three days.  The evidence\nwas held open, and Taylor was allowed to present the testimony of additional\nwitnesses on May 12, 1994 and June 6, 1994.  The state adduced evidence concerning\nthe abduction and murder of Ann Harrison, as well as evidence of Taylor's escape\nfrom  custody.    The  defense  called  ten  witnesses  in  purported  mitigation  of\npunishment.\n   On June 17, 1994, over three years after he had first received the penalty of\ndeath, Taylor appeared before Judge Coburn for formal sentencing.  In oral and\nwritten findings, Judge Coburn found six statutory aggravating circumstances beyond\na reasonable doubt, as well as three non-statutory aggravating circumstances.  Judge\nCoburn found the existence of one mitigating circumstance, rejecting several others\noffered by Taylor, and concluded that the mitigating circumstance did not outweigh\nthe aggravating circumstances of this case, making the sentence of death appropriate.\nTaylor also received fifty years for armed criminal action, fifteen years for kidnaping\nand life imprisonment for rape, all terms to run consecutively.  Taylor filed an appeal.\n13\n\nHe also sought post-conviction relief under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 24.035.\nThis time, again on consolidated appeal, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed.  State\nv. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo. banc 1996).  The United States Supreme Court\ndenied review.  Taylor v. Missouri, 519 U.S. 1152 (1997).  \nTaylor initiated a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Missouri.  The district court denied the petition, and\non May 7, 2003, this Court affirmed.  Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d 963 (8th Cir.\n2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 947 (2004).  \nFacts of Criminal Case. The Supreme Court of Missouri described the\ncircumstances surrounding Taylor's offenses in the direct appeal opinion. \nAccording  to  Taylor's  testimony  at  his  guilty  plea,  Taylor's\nvideotaped statement and other evidence adduced in the sentencing\nhearing, Taylor and a companion, Roderick Nunley, spent the night of\nMarch 21, 1989, driving a stolen Chevrolet Monte Carlo, stealing \"T-\ntops,\" smoking marijuana and drinking wine coolers.  At one point\nduring the early morning hours of March 22, they were followed by a\npolice car, but lost the police after a high speed chase on a highway.\nAbout 7:00 a.m., they saw fifteen-year-old Ann Harrison waiting for the\nschool bus at the end of her driveway.  Nunley told Taylor, who was\ndriving at the time, to stop so Nunley could snatch her purse.  Taylor\nstopped the car, Nunley got out, pretended to need directions, grabbed\nher and put her in the front seat between Taylor and Nunley.  Once in\nthe car, Nunley blindfolded Ann with his sock and threatened to stab her\nwith a screwdriver if she was not quiet.  Taylor drove to Nunley's house\nand took Ann to the basement.  By this time her hands were bound with\ncable wire.  Nunley removed Ann's clothes and had forcible sexual\nintercourse with her.  Taylor then had forcible intercourse with her.\nThey untied her, and allowed her to dress.  Ann tried to persuade them\n14\n\nto call her parents for ransom, and Nunley indicated he would take her\nto a telephone to call home.  They put the blindfold back on her and tied\nher hands and led her to the trunk of the Monte Carlo.  Ann resisted\ngetting into the trunk until Nunley told her it was necessary so she\nwould not be seen.  Both men helped her into the trunk.\nNunley then returned to the house for two knives, a butcher knife\nand a smaller steak knife.  Nunley argued with Taylor about whether to\nkill her.  Nunley did not want Ann to be able to testify against him and\nemphasized he and Taylor were in this together.  Nunley then attempted\nto slash her throat but the knife was too dull.  He stabbed her through the\nthroat and told Taylor to \"stick her.\"  Nunley continued to stab, and\nTaylor stabbed Ann \"two or three times, probably four.\"  He described\nhow \"her eyes rolled up in her head, and she was sort to like trying to\ncatch her, her breath.\"  \nNunley and Taylor argued about who would drive the Monte\nCarlo, and Nunley ended up driving it following Taylor who was driving\nanother car.  Taylor picked up Nunley after he abandoned the Monte\nCarlo with Ann Harrison in the trunk.  They returned to Nunley's house\nwhere Nunley disposed of the sock, the cable wire, and the knives.\nWhen the school bus arrived at the Harrison home to pick up Ann,\nthe driver honked because she was not there.  Mrs. Harrison looked out\nof the window and noticed Ann's purse, gym clothes, books, and flute\nlying on the driveway.  She waved for the bus to go on and began to\nlook for her daughter.  Police quickly mounted a ground and air search.\nAnn Harrison's body was discovered the evening of March 23rd when\npolice found the abandoned Monte Carlo and a friend of the car's owner\nopened the trunk.\nThe State's physical evidence included hair matching Taylor's\ncollected from Ann Harrison's body and the passenger side of the Monte\nCarlo, hair matching Ann's collected from Nunley's basement, sperm and\nsemen belonging to Taylor found on Ann's clothes and body.  An\nautopsy revealed a lacerated vagina, six stab wounds to Ann's chest,\nside, and back which penetrated her heart and lungs, and four stab\nwounds to her neck.  The medical examiner testified Ann Harrison was\nalive when all the wounds were inflicted and could have remained\n15\n\nconscious for ten minutes after the stabbing.  She probably lived thirty\nminutes after the attack.\nState v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209, 214 (Mo. banc 1996) (footnote omitted).\nProcedural History of this Case.  Plaintiff-appellee Michael Anthony Taylor\ninitiated this litigation on June 3, 2005, by filing a complaint requesting preliminary\ninjunctive relief, declaratory relief, and a permanent injunction against his execution\nby means of Missouri’s lethal injection procedure.  App. 1.7  He filed an amended\ncomplaint  on  September  12,  2005.    App.  35-101.    In  his  complaints,  Taylor\nchallenged the constitutionality of Missouri’s execution process.\nOn January 3, 2006, the Missouri Supreme Court set February 1, 2006, as\nTaylor’s execution date.  App. 102.  On January 19, 2006, the district court granted\nTaylor’s application for an order prohibiting his execution.  App. 124-25.  The prison\nofficial defendants appealed that order.  App. 126-27.  On January 29, 2006, this\nCourt vacated the stay in part and remanded the cause to the district court for further\nproceedings.  App. 129-30.\n7References to the Addendum are denoted “Add. ___.”  References to the\nAppendix are denoted “App. ___.”  References to the transcripts of the several days\nof trial are denoted “Jan. 30 Tr. ___,” “Jan. 31 Tr. ___,” or “June Tr. ___.”  (These\nvarious transcript references are used because the transcripts of the proceedings on\nJanuary 30 and 31, 2006, are separately paginated from one another and also\nseparately paginated from the transcript of the proceedings on June 12 and 13, 2006.\n16\n\nOn January 30-31, 2006, the district court held an evidentiary hearing.  App. 8.\nThe court found Taylor’s claims meritless, Add. 1-9; App. 131-39, and entered\njudgment in favor of the prison officials on January 31, 2006.  App. 140.  Taylor filed\na Notice of Appeal on the same day.  App. 141-42.  On February 1, 2006, a panel of\nthis Court denied Taylor’s request for stay of execution, but the Court en banc issued\na stay.  App. 145-46.  The United States Supreme Court declined to vacate that stay.\nApp. 147.\nOn April 27, 2006, the court remanded the cause to the district court for further\nproceedings.   Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1045 (8th Cir. 2006); App. 148-54. \nAfter extensive discovery, the district court held a supplemental hearing on June 12-\n13, 2006.  App. 19.  The district court issued its order amending its January 31, 2006,\norder on June 26, 2006.  App. 187-202; Add. 10-25.  It required the defendant prison\nofficials to submit a “written protocol for the implementation of lethal injections” by\nJuly 15, 2006.  App. 199-201; Add. 22-24.  The prison officials submitted a written\nprotocol on July 14, 2006, App. 203-26; Add. 32-35, and then appealed the June 26\norder as a precaution (in case it would be interpreted as an order final for purposes\nof appeal).  App.227-28.  The district court concluded it no longer had jurisdiction.\nApp. 354-55.  This Court remanded the case “to the district court for consideration\nof [the] newly propounded protocol and all other issues” on August 9, 2006.  Taylor\nv. Crawford, 457 F.3d 902 (8th Cir. 2006); App. 356-59.\n17\n\nOn September 12, 2006, the district court found the protocol insufficient and\ndirected the prison official defendants to submit a revised protocol.  App. 372-75;\nAdd. 26-29.  In response, the prison officials maintained that the protocol did comply\nwith the Eighth Amendment and asked the court to reconsider its conclusion to the\ncontrary.  App.  377-79.   On October 16, 2006, the district court declined to\nreconsider its order and entered judgment against the prison officials.  App. 385-85;\nAdd. 30-31.  The prison officials appealed.  App. 386-88.\nStatement of Facts Regarding Lethal Injection Procedure.  Missouri’s lethal\ninjection procedure, as established at the time Taylor filed this suit, was  described\nin detail in interrogatory responses from defendant Crawford admitted into evidence\nat the hearing in this case.  After the condemned prisoner is brought into the\nexecution room, a doctor sets an IV catheter in the condemned prisoner’s femoral\nvein.  App. 813.  Once the catheter is in place, the doctor injects flush solution\nthrough the tube into the vein to make sure the line flows freely.  App. 813.\nAfter the IV is in place and its flow checked, the Director of the Department\nof Corrections directs that the execution begin.  App. 820.  The Director does not give\nthis order until he receives word that the governor has declined to exercise clemency\nand that the courts have declined to order a stay.  App. 820.  \n18\n\nWhen the order to proceed is given, prison officers inject five grams of\nthiopental prepared in a 60cc solution into the IV tubing leading to the femoral\ncatheter set by the doctor.  App. 820.  Then 30cc of flush is injected to clear the line.\nApp. 820.  After the flush, 60cc of pancuronium bromide is injected.  App. 820.\nNext, another 30cc of flush is injected to clear the line.  App. 820.  After this flush,\n240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride is injected.  App. 821.   Finally, 60cc of\nflush is injected.   App. 821. The entire process of injection of the chemicals and flush\ntakes approximately 2 to 4 minutes.  App. 821.\nOnce  all  the  chemicals  are  administered  the  doctor  monitors  the\nelectrocardiogram machine and determines death when all electrical activity of the\nheart ends.  App. 814, 821.  The time from injection of the first chemical to death, as\nshown by complete cessation of electrical activity in the heart, is from two to five\nminutes.  Jan. 31 Tr. 72-73; App. 804.\nThe thiopental renders the condemned prisoner sufficiently unconscious to be\nunable to experience pain.  App. 391 (¶ 5).  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Mark Dershwitz,\ntestified  that  by  the  time  five  grams  of  this  chemical  are  injected,  over\n99.99999999 % of the population would be unconscious.  App. 392 (¶ 8).  He also\ntestified that there is only an approximately 0.000000006 % probability that a\ncondemned prisoner given this amount would be conscious and able to experience\npain  after  five  minutes.    App.  393  (¶  9).    Dr.  Dershwitz  calculated  the  same\n19\n\nprobability of consciousness after ten minutes at approximately 0.0000015 %, after\nthirty minutes at 0.000021 %, and after sixty minutes at 0.00047 %.  App. 393 (¶¶ 10-\n12).  According to Dr. Dershwitz, most people receiving five grams of thiopental\nwould be unconscious in excess of seven hours, assuming they were able to continue\nbreathing.  App. 393 (¶ 13).\nThe injection of pancuronium bromide will cause complete paralysis within a\nfew minutes.  Jan. 30 Tr. 27.  The pancuronium bromide will prevent seizure activity\nduring an execution and thereby result in a more peaceful and dignified death.  App.\n797.  Administration of potassium chloride in the amount used in Missouri executions\nwill quickly stop the heart.  Jan. 30 Tr. 29.\nIn recent executions, the assisting doctor had difficulty mixing a 60cc solution\ncontaining five grams of thiopental because of a change of packaging.  App. 643-47,\n672-75.  As a result, he prepared solutions that contained 2.5 grams of thiopental.\nApp. 647-53, 664-65, 675.  The doctor, based on his medical knowledge and\nexperience, determined the lesser amount used to be more than sufficient to render\nthe condemned prisoner deeply unconscious and unable to experience any pain.\nApp. 627-28, 629, 676, 687.  Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Thomas Henthorn, testified that\nas little as 1.67 grams of thiopental will result in a deep state of unconsciousness in\nalmost  everyone.    June  Tr.  233,  241-42.    Dr.  Henthorn  also  testified  that\n20\n\nadministration of the much larger than clinical amounts he was discussing will remain\neffective for 45 minutes to hours.  June Tr. 245-46.\nThe doctor assisting at executions reduced the standard five gram amount of\nthiopental at his own discretion, believing that he had authority to do so based on his\nlong experience assisting at executions.  App. 626; June Tr. 341-42, 367-68.  When\nthe Director of the Department of Corrections learned that the doctor had not used the\nprescribed 2.5 grams, he was extremely concerned that the doctor had not reported\nthe change in the amount of thiopental used, but he also was of the understanding that\n2.5 grams was still six times the amount normally given for surgery.  June Tr. 366-69.\nBecause of the modification in the amount of thiopental used, which had occurred\nwithout his knowledge, the Director determined to prepare a directive to make the\napproved protocol explicit and to insure that changes in the amounts of chemicals\nused would occur only with his approval.  June Tr. 369-74.  The planned directive\nalso included an auditing process.  June Tr. 373-74.  Once the directive was complete\nand before any further executions, the Director planned to meet with his staff,\nincluding the doctor, to explain it.  June Tr. 374.  Under the Director’s plan, he would\nemphasize that changes in the amounts of chemicals used required his pre-approval.\nJune Tr. 371-74.\nAfter the hearing in this case, and the district court’s direction to submit a\nprotocol to it, the prison official defendants prepared a written protocol for the court’s\n21\n\nreview.  App. 215-18; Add. 32-35.  In summary, the protocol requires a physician,\nnurse or pharmacist to prepare the chemicals used during the lethal injection.  App.\n215-16; Add. 32-33 (§§A.2 & B).  A physician, nurse, or EMT inserts the intravenous\nlines, monitors the condemned and supervises the injection of lethal chemicals by\nnon-medical members of the execution team.  App. 215-17; Add. 32-34 (§§A.3, C,\nD, & E.3 to E.4 ).  The protocol requires administration of five grams of thiopental\nin 200cc of solution, a 30cc saline flush, 60 mg of pancuronium bromide in 60cc\nsolution, a 30cc flush, 240 milliequivalent of potassium chloride followed by a 60cc\nflush.  App. 215; Add. 32 (§B.1 to B.7). \nFollowing administration of the thiopental, medical personnel examine the\ncondemned to confirm that he is unconscious.  App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.3).  In the\nunlikely event the condemned is still  conscious following the first injection of\nthiopental, then another five gram injection would occur.  App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.4).\nThe condemned would then be examined again for consciousness.  App. 217; Add.\n34 (§E.3 & 5).  Once the condemned is unconscious and three minutes have lapsed\nfrom the effective injection of thiopental, App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.5), then the\nremaining  chemicals  are  injected.    App.  217;  Add.  34  (§E.5  to  E.9).    If  the\ncondemned’s heart does not cease activity within five minutes, then additional\npotassium chloride is injected to cause death.  App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.10).   When\nelectrical activity of the heart ceases, then medical personnel pronounce death.  App.\n22\n\n217; Add. 34 (§E.11).   Finally, there are procedures to document the chemicals used\nduring the execution process.  App. 218; Add. 35 (§F).\n23\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nUnder United States Supreme Court precedent, a punishment is cruel and\nunusual, and thereby in violation of the Eighth Amendment, only if that punishment\ninvolves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  There is no foundation in the\ntext of the Eighth Amendment to reset the standard to prohibit punishments that\ncreate only an unreasonable risk of unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  A\n“risk” standard is also unworkable in that all human activity entails risk.  Such a\nstandard could also tempt courts to become involved in decisions properly vested in\nthe executive.\nSome level of scienter is also required before a punishment may be found to\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.  Be it deliberate indifference, malicious and sadistic,\nor some other mental state, there must be some finding of intent to inflict cruel and\nunusual punishment before the Eighth Amendment applies.  Missouri officials whose\nduty is to carry out executions are quite concerned that they carry out this duty as\nhumanely as possible.\nRegardless of whether the Supreme Court’s standard or the “risk” standard\napplies,  Missouri’s  lethal  injection  procedure  is  consistent  with  the  Eighth\nAmendment.  The initial injection of five grams of thiopental, many times the amount\nused during surgery, is more than sufficient to render the condemned prisoner deeply\n24\n\nunconscious and unable to experience any pain from the administration of the next\ntwo  chemicals.    Missouri’s  procedure  is  also  expressly  formulated,  provides\nreasonable guidance as to its implementation, and is subject to appropriate oversight.\nAlthough the district court firmly believes that the assistance of a doctor is\nnecessary at an execution by lethal injection, the presence of a doctor is not mandated\nby the Eighth Amendment.  Missouri’s lethal injection procedure contains many\nsafeguards that provide assurance that condemned prisoners will not experience\nunnecessary and wanton pain, or an unreasonable risk of such pain, regardless of\nwhether a doctor takes part.  \nMoreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a doctor to participate at an\nexecution  due  largely  to  personal  ethical  concerns  or  concerns  that  licensing\nauthorities will deem such participation a violation of professional ethical standards.\nBecause it may be impossible to find a doctor to take part in one or more executions,\na requirement of doctor participation could effectively prevent implementation of the\ndeath penalty.\n25\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nOn review of a bench trial, as occurred here, the appellate court reviews the\ntrial court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.  Darst-\nWebbe Tenant Ass'n Bd. v. St. Louis Housing Auth., 339 F.3d 702, 710-11 (8th Cir.\n2003).\n26\n\nARGUMENT\nI.  \nThe  district  court  erred  in  determining  that  Missouri’s  method  of\nexecution  violates  the  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  clause  of  the  Eighth\nAmendment because (1) lethal injection does not involve the unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain and (2) the state does not intend lethal injection to\ncause unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\nIn its October 16, 2006, order and judgment finding Missouri’s lethal injection\nprotocol unconstitutional, the district court applied an Eighth Amendment legal\nstandard  unsupported by  Supreme Court  precedent.      The  Supreme  Court  has\nconcluded  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  states  from  purposefully\ninflicting unnecessary and wanton pain.  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329\nU.S. 459, 464 (1947); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976).  In stark contrast to\nthis settled law, the district court failed to find two elements of an Eighth Amendment\nclaim:  (1) unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain that (2) was purposefully\ninflicted.  The district court only found that the Missouri protocol “subjects inmates\nto unreasonable risk of cruel and unusual punishment.”  App. 384; Add. 31 (emphasis\nadded)).   That “risk” standard has not been adopted by the United States Supreme\nCourt as its interpretation of the Eighth Amendment.  And there was no finding that\n27\n\nthe prison official defendants acted purposefully or with any other mental state.\nWhen the proper Supreme Court’s Eighth Amendment standard is applied to the facts\nadduced before the district court, it becomes readily apparent that prison officials\nwere entitled to judgment.  \nUnnecessary and Wanton Infliction of Pain\nThe Supreme Court provided its guidance on the lawfulness of a method of\nexecution under the Eighth Amendment in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976).\nAfter reviewing the history of the Eighth Amendment to the constitution, id. at 169-\n70,  and  its  previous  cases,  id.  at  170-71,  the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  “the\npunishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.”  Id. at\n173.  Conspicuously missing from this statement of the law is the word “risk,” the\nlynchpin of the district court’s judgment.\nNor does one find the word “risk” in the earlier decisions by the Supreme\nCourt.  The Supreme Court has addressed a constitutional challenge to a method of\nexecution  at  least  three  times  and  in  none  of  those  decisions  was  “risk”  a\nconsideration.  In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1878), the court discussed whether\nUtah could execute by shooting without violating the Eighth Amendment.  The court\nmade clear it viewed the Eighth Amendment as prohibiting “punishments of torture,”\nsuch as  ones that involve “unnecessary cruelty.”  Id. at 136.  The meaning of these\n28\n\nphrases is supplied by the preceding paragraphs in Wilkerson where there was\ndiscussion about when “terror, pain or disgrace [was] sometimes superadded” to\nsentences of capital punishment.   Id. at 135.  Examples given were “where the\nprisoner was drawn or dragged to the place of execution” for the crime of treason or\nwhere the prisoner “was embowelled alive, beheaded and quartered” as punishment\nfor the crime of high-treason.  Id.  The court also mentioned public dissection for the\noffense of murder or the prisoner being burned alive for the offense of treason\ncommitted by a woman.  Id.  As Wilkerson makes clear, the method of execution,\nshooting, did not violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause, id. at 136, because\nit was not a punishment of “unnecessary cruelty.”  In contrast to the district court, the\nWilkerson decision did not incorporate  “risk” of cruel and unusual punishment as its\nEighth Amendment analysis even though there is a “risk” of the volley’s failure to\nkill.   See http://historytogo. utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/012896.html\n(last visited 11-27-06) (reviewing Utah’s “botched execution” by firing squad).\nIn a second decision about a method of execution, the Supreme Court upheld\nNew York’s use of electrocution as a means of execution.  In re Kemmler, 136 U.S.\n436 (1890).  In its analysis, the Court described the Eighth Amendment as prohibiting\na state from having a punishment for an offense that was as “manifestly cruel and\nunusual as burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking on the wheel or the like . . . .”\nId. at 446.  Speaking more generally, the court stated:\n29\n\nPunishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death;\nbut the punishment of death is not cruel within the meaning of that word\nas used in the constitution.  It implies there something inhuman and\nbarbarous, - - something more than the mere extinguishment of life.  \nId. at 447.\nSimilarly, when the Supreme Court revisited the electric chair as a method of\nexecution, the analysis of the Supreme Court did not change.  Louisiana ex rel.\nFrancis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947).  It relied heavily on In re Kemmler, 136\nU.S. at 436, and found use of the Louisiana electric chair to be constitutional.  329\nU.S. at 464.  The court examined the Louisiana fact pattern to determine if torture\nwere involved.  329 U.S. at 463-64.  Because there was no torture, Louisiana’s use\nof the electric chair was constitutional.  Id. at 464.   The Reseweber decision did not\nincorporate “risk” of cruel and unusual punishment as its Eighth Amendment analysis\neven though there was a “risk” of the chair’s failure to perform.  See generally http://\ncapitaldefenseweekly.com/chair.htm (last visited 11/27/06), at pages 2 & n.36-37,\n12-13).\nAs this Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the issue before the district court\nwas whether lethal injection as a means of execution constitutes torture such as\nburning at the stake, crucifixion, quartering and the like.  And it is not.  Lethal\ninjection is not used as a means of execution that tortures the offender.  The district\n30\n\ncourt did not conclude that Missouri’s lethal injection was torture or involved the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\nThe district court could not find lethal injection was torture; instead, it held that\nlethal injection created an “unreasonable risk of cruel and unusual punishment.”  App.\n384; Add. 31.  The district court did not cite legal authority for this legal proposition,\nrisk, in its October 16 order.  App. 384; Add.31.  In a previous order, the district court\ncited another district court’s decision, Morales v. Hickman, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1037,\n1039 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (subsequent history omitted).  App. 196-97; Add. 19-20.  And\ninstead of citing precedent from the United States Supreme Court, the district court\nin Morales quoted a previous decision from the Ninth Circuit that has the phrase\n“unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain.”  Id. (quoting Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d\n1029, 1033 (9th Cir. 2004)).  When the Court reads Cooper, however, the Ninth\nCircuit did not cite precedent from the Supreme Court or, for that matter, from any\nother court to support its “unnecessary risk” standard.  \nBut an examination of the Cooper decision reveals the source of its “risk”\nstandard.  In Cooper, the offender was seeking a temporary restraining order and a\npreliminary injunction.  379 F.3d at 1030.   Cooper’s goal in the litigation was to\nobtain a stay of execution.  Id.   The question before the district court and then the\nNinth Circuit was whether there was a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering that\nwould justify a stay of execution and a preliminary injunction.  Id. at 1030, 1032.\n31\n\nThis  court  uses  similar  risk  analysis  when  it  reviews  a  preliminary  injunction\nsituation.  See e.g., Dataphase Systems v. C L Systems, 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir.\n1981) (“threat of irreparable harm to the movant”).  \nAnd while that is appropriate for appellate review of a preliminary injunction,\nthe district court here was not issuing a preliminary injunction in its eventual October\n16, 2006 order and judgment.  App. 383-85; Add. 30-31  Instead, the district court\nconflated the preliminary injunction standard with the Eighth Amendment standard\nto create a novel standard, a standard that inquired into the unreasonable “risk” of\nunconstitutional pain and suffering.  App. 187-88; Add.  10-11.\nThis Court should reject a “risk” standard of Eighth Amendment analysis for\na multitude of reasons.  First, the “risk” standard has no foundation in the text of the\nEighth  Amendment.    The  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  “cruel  and  unusual\npunishments.”  It does not refer to either a risk of excessive bail nor the risk of an\nexcessive fine nor the risk of cruel and unusual punishment.   \nSecond, a “risk” standard is unworkable.  All human activity entails risk.  See\nhttp://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1564144,00.html?cnn=yes  (“How\nWe Confuse Real Risks With Exaggerated Ones”) (emotions exaggerating risk\nanalysis) (last visited 11/29/06).  And with the introduction of the “risk” premise\ncomes the inevitable claims that all bail and fines carry some risk of being excessive\nand that all forms of punishment, including incarceration, carry some risk of being\n32\n\ncruel and unusual.  It is safe to say that going to prison is fraught with risks.  Of\ncourse, such an outcome is unworkable.   An example illustrates: in the complaint’s\nprayer  for  relief,  Taylor  concedes  that  his  execution  by  a  single  barbiturate\n(pentobarbitol) would satisfy him.  App. 22 (¶ 54).   But, in the Morales litigation,\nTaylor’s expert, Dr. Heath, contends that administration of the single chemical is “not\ndevoid of risks.”  http://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%\n20Documents/California/Morales%20Dist%20Ct/November%20filing/Heath%20\nPost-Trial%20Decl.pdf (last visited 11/29/06) (Paragraph 59).8  It seems that every\nhuman endeavor has risks.\nThe Supreme Court precedents have been recognized by other courts.  In\nCampbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir. 1994), the court stated: “The risk of\naccident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution process in order to\nsurvive constitutional review.”  See also Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329\nU.S. at 464.  And the dissent in Campbell was not to the contrary.  It viewed death by\n8The risk standard does not become more workable by adding an adjective to\ndescribe risk, e.g., unreasonable or unnecessary.  It is the word “risk,” with or without\nan adjective, that gives rise to uncertainty, with its following litigation that makes that\nstandard an unworkable constitutional standard.  And the adjectives are uncertain as\nwell.   Do odds of 1 in 10 of an adverse event render a punishment an unreasonable\nrisk or an unnecessary risk?   1 in 100?   There was no quantification of risk by the\ndistrict court, perhaps because there was no testimony about quantification.\n33\n\nhanging as comparable to the “rack and screw” that would violate the Eighth\nAmendment, as discussed by the Supreme Court in Wilkerson and Kemmler.\nSimilarly, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and the Connecticut\nSupreme Court have noted that an execution process has the possibility of human\nerror, but the risk of accident need not be eliminated in order for the method of\nexecution to survive constitutional challenge.  Malicoat v. State, 137 P.3d 1234, 1238\n(Okla. Crim. App. 2006), citing State v. Webb, 750 A.2d 448, 456-57 (Conn. 2000).\nThird, use of risk as the constitutional standard empowers the judiciary to\nassume the executive role of executioner in a Camelot-like quest to lower risks.  That\nis precisely what the district court did here with regard to personnel qualifications.\nIn the June order, the district court ordered the prison officials to use a board certified\nanesthesiologist,  App. 200; Add. 23, even though none is available.  When prison\nofficials pointed this out, App. 206-07, the district court indicated it would be\nsatisfied with “a physician with training in the application and administration of\nanesthesia,” App. 373; Add. 27, but again without any showing of availability.   The\nsame can be said of the monitoring machine.  App. 373; Add. 27.\nA method of execution should pass or not pass constitutional scrutiny based on\nits own characteristics, not on the potential for “risk.” \n34\n\nMental State\nNot only does the district court fail to find the “unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain,” but also there is no finding of scienter by the prison officials. \nThat omission is understandable given the testimony by the prison officials of the\ndesire to have an effective, humane and speedy execution.  June Tr. 367, 392-93.\nDefendant Crawford testified to this effect several times during his testimony at the\nhearing.  June Tr. 368-69, 372-73, 376-79, 382-83).  “So we’re just going to make\nthis process better and there will be a directive forthcoming on that.”  June Tr. 369.\n“I will say I have faith that we have done constitutional and humane executions, the\nones that I have had experience with.”  June Tr. 378.  \nA finding of scienter  is  necessary before lethal injection as a means of\nexecution is declared unconstitutional.  The Resweber decision concluded that\nLouisiana  did  not  have  the  “purpose”  of  adding  an  element  of  cruelty  to  the\nexecution.  329 U.S. at 464.  And in Missouri, there is no such purpose.  In fact,\nMissouri’s purpose is precisely the opposite.  Not long ago, the federal courts were\nencouraging the states to use lethal injection as their means of execution.  See Callins\nv.  Collins,  510  U.S.  1141,  1143  (1994)  (dissent  of  Blackmun,  J.) (describing\npeacefulness of lethal injection); Bryan v. Moore, 528 U.S. 1133 (2000) (dismissing\nthe writ of certiorari as improvidently granted because Florida would carry out\n35\n\nexecution by lethal injection instead of electrocution); Gomez v. United States\nDistrict  Court,  503  U.S.  653,  656  (1992)  (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting)  (describing\nalternative to gas chamber (lethal injection) as a “more humane and less violent\nmethod of execution”).  Following the suggestions of these courts and the actions of\nother state legislatures, the Missouri legislature adopted lethal injection as the means\nof execution.  §545.720, RSMo 2000.  The motives of the state in adopting lethal\ninjection were proper, the antithesis of the mental state necessary to show an Eighth\nAmendment violation.  \nSimilarly, in the context of operating a correctional facility, Eighth Amendment\nreview asks whether prison officials display “deliberate indifference” to the inmate’s\nhealth and safety.   See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002).  The deliberate\nindifference  standard  subjects  prison  officials  to  liability  only  when  they  are\nsubjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmate, and they failed\nto take reasonable measures to abate it.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 847\n(1994); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 300 (1991).  In the prison context, only\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes a violation\nof the Eighth Amendment.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).  So if capital\npunishment were viewed as a “medical procedure” rather than a punishment, Taylor\nwould have to show deliberate indifference, which he did not do.\n36\n\nOr perhaps lethal injection is better understood as an “excessive force” Eighth\nAmendment issue where liability of prison officials requires that they use force\n“maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.”  Whitley v.\nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 320-21 (1986); Cummings v. Malone, 995 F.2d 817, 822 (8th\nCir. 1993).\nIn contrast to these Supreme Court precedents is the district court decision.\nThe  district  court  made  no  finding  of  “purpose,”  “deliberate  indifference,”\n“maliciously or sadistically,” or of any other mental state by the prison officials in any\nof its rulings.  Nor was there a basis for such a finding.  The record demonstrates that\nMissouri prison officials were and are conscientious in performing an execution.  For\nexample,  Defendant  Crawford,  the  Director  of  the  Missouri  Department  of\nCorrections, became familiar with the execution process after becoming Director in\nearly 2005.  June Tr. 364.  During the course of the litigation before the district court,\nit became apparent that half the prescribed five grams of thiopental, the initial\nchemical injected, had been used at the last executions.  June Tr. 341-42.4  Upon\nlearning of this deviation, Defendant Crawford has directed that future executions\nbegin with a five gram injection of thiopental.  June Tr. 366-70.  \n4The average person loses unconsciousness after administration of 200 to 300\nmilligrams of thiopental (.2 to .3 grams).  Tr. 267-68.  Some states use as little as 2\ngrams of thiopental in executions.  Tr. 264.\n37\n\nThere is no culpable mental state by prison officials in this cause; thus, the\ndistrict court’s failure to find scienter is understandable and correct.  But that\nomission also mandates reversal of the district court’s judgment.  \n38\n\nII.\nThe Missouri lethal injection protocol does not create an unnecessary risk\nof unconstitutional pain or suffering.\nIn Point I, prison officials discuss how the district court used an incorrect legal\nstandard by which to measure the constitutionality of lethal injection in Missouri.  In\nthis and succeeding Points, they will assume the legal standard articulated by the\ndistrict  court  is  correct  but  demonstrate  that  the  district  court  misapplied  that\nstandard.\nPre-Existing Lethal Injection Procedure Consistent with Eighth Amendment\nThe district court required Taylor to show there was “an unnecessary risk of\nunconstitutional pain or suffering. . . .”  App. 196; Add. 19 (quoting Morales v.\nHickman, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1037, 1039 (N.D. Cal. 2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.\n2006), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006)).  The court then inquired whether there\nwas “a reasonable possibility that Plaintiff will be conscious when he is injected with\npancuronium bromide [Chemical #2] or potassium chloride [Chemical #3], and, if so,\nhow the risk of such an occurrence may be avoided.”  App. 197; Add. 20 (quoting\nMorales, 415 F. Supp. 2d at 1040).  When the evidence from the June 12-13, 2006,\nevidentiary hearing is reviewed, the inevitable legal conclusion is that there is no\n39\n\n“reasonable  possibility  that  plaintiff  will  be  conscious”  at  the  time  of  the\nadministration of chemicals two and three.\nTestimony at the June 12-13 hearing revealed that Missouri would use three\nchemicals with its lethal injection protocol.  The first chemical was five grams of\nthiopental administered in a 60cc syringe.  June Tr. 370.   A flush followed in order\nto clear the lines.  June Tr. 370-71.  After the flush came another 60cc solution\ncontaining 60 milligrams of pancuronium bromide.  June Tr. 371.  Following a\nsecond flush was the third chemical, 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride in\n120cc solution.  June Tr. 371.  Then there was a third flush that cleared the lines.\nJune Tr. 371.\nThe first chemical, thiopental, renders the condemned unconscious so that the\nexecution is humane.  June Tr. 264.   The five gram injection is a large multiple of the\namount that the average person needs in order to lose consciousness (.2 to .3 grams).\nJune Tr. 267.  The five gram amount induces unconsciousness greater than that\nnecessary for surgery.  June Tr. 286.5  \n5Shortly after lethal injection became a common method of execution, death row\noffenders sued the Food and Drug Administration requesting, inter alia, the criminal\nprosecution of drug manufacturers because the drugs had not been certified as “safe\nand effective” for execution.  Chaney v. Heckler, 718 F.2d 1174, 1178 (D.C. Cir.\n1983).   he Supreme Court eventually rejected the suit.  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S.\n821 (1985).  Opponents of capital punishment pressure companies not to supply the\nchemicals.  See Drug Companies and Their Role in Aiding Execution, pp. 8-9 (2002)\n(available at http://www.ncadp.org/assets/applets/report.pdf (last visited 11-27-06).\n40\n\nThe second chemical, pancuronium bromide, causes paralysis of the skeletal\nmuscles, prevents a person from having voluntary muscle movement, and results in\nan inability to breathe.  Jan. 30 Tr. 27.   And the third chemical, potassium chloride\nends electrical activity in the heart, causing it to stop.  June Tr. 288-89.  Because the\ncondemned is unconscious from the first chemical, the condemned feels no adverse\neffects from the second or third chemical.  June Tr. 285-89.\nIn three concise pages of the June 26 order, the district court disagrees and\nfinds this procedure violates Taylor’s Eighth Amendment rights.  App. 197-99; Add.\n20-22.  The district court had four complaints.\nFirst, the district court complains “there is no written protocol which describes\nwhich drugs will be administered, in what amounts and defines how they will be\nadministered.”  App. 197; Add. 20.  But the district court refers to no authority that\nstates  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  requires  a  written  execution  protocol.    See\nAbdur’rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 305 (Tenn. 2005) (rejecting Eighth\nAmendment challenge to Tennessee protocol, based in part on lack of written\nprovisions).  And both Larry Crawford, Director of the Department of Corrections\nand Terry Moore, Director of the Department’s Division of Adult Institutions,\ntestified about the chemicals that would be administered, in what amounts, and how\nthey would be administered at a future execution.  June Tr. 344-45, 369-71.  The\nchemicals, their amounts, and the order of administration would be reduced to writing\n41\n\nbefore the next execution.  June Tr. 369.  And now, the Department has developed a\nwritten protocol, which establishes detailed guidelines as to the preparation and\ninjection of the chemicals used.  App.  215-18; Add. 32-35.6  The district court’s\ncriticism of the Department’s lack of a written protocol was not factually well-\nfounded and, now that the Department has such a protocol, the concern is moot.\nSecond, the district court criticized prison officials because “Dr. Doe also\ntestified that he felt that he had the authority to change or modify the formula as he\nsaw fit.”  App. 197; Add. 20.  The court noted that John Doe had changed the\nprotocol by changing the amount of thiopental from five grams to 2.5 grams as well\nas the injection site.  App. 197; Add. 20.  The criticism by the district court misses the\nmark. \nDuring the course of litigation, the record reflected that Dr. Doe had changed\nthe amount of thiopental to inject from five grams to 2.5 grams for the execution of\nGray and in preparation for the February 1, 2006 execution of Taylor.  App. 193;\nAdd. 16.  Even administration of 2.5 grams is six times the surgical amount.  June Tr.\n368.  This amount ensures unconsciousness.  June Tr. 283-84.  But the district court\nexpressed concern that the protocol could “change at a moment’s notice” due to the\ndiscretion maintained by Dr. Doe.  App.  197; Add. 20.  That concern by the district\n6The Department considers this protocol a good policy instrument.  It does not\nconcede that the provisions of the protocol are constitutionally required. \n42\n\ncourt is not supported by the record because Director Crawford made clear that he\nhad the discretion, not Dr. Doe.  June Tr. 371.\nThe record developed at the June hearing reflects that Director Crawford is the\nperson who “has the authority to set the method of execution within the dictates in\nMissouri statute.”  June Tr. 363.   The Director’s learning of Dr. Doe's previous\nchange in the amount of thiopental administered led to the Director’s intent to issue\na defined protocol “so that this didn’t happen again.”  June Tr. 369.  “So we’re just\ngoing to make this process better and there will be a directive forthcoming on that.”\nJune Tr. 369.  The purpose was so that there would be “a clear understanding of the\nprocess, notification, and we will reach an agreement that that’s what we will follow,\nabsent any order of the court before then.”  June Tr. 370.   At the hearing, the Director\narticulated that under the protocol, five grams of thiopental would be given along\nwith 60 mg of pancuronium bromide and 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride.\nJune Tr. 370-71.  Neither the chemicals themselves nor the order of the chemicals,\nnor the administration could be changed by anyone other than Director Crawford.\nJune Tr. 371.  While any change in the protocol could be made by Director Crawford,\nno change would occur without his consultation with others.  June Tr. 372-73.\nDirector Crawford intended that Dr. Doe be fully aware of the terms of the protocol.\nJune Tr. 374.  And this, too, was Dr. Doe’s understanding.  App. 731-33.\n43\n\nWhile the district court articulated concern that Dr. Doe had “total discretion\nfor the execution protocol,” App.197; Add.20, whatever validity those concerns may\nhave had before the litigation, those concerns should have evaporated in light of\nDirector Crawford’s forceful testimony.  Tr. 371-74.  Additionally, that discretion by\nDr. Doe does not exist under the written protocol.  “The quantities of these chemicals\nmay not be changed without prior approval of the department director.”  App. 215;\nAdd. 32 (§B.1).  \nThe third concern articulated by the district court involved Dr. Doe's ability to\nmix drugs.  App. 198; App. Add. 21.  Of course, Chemical 2, pancuronium bromide,\nand Chemical 3, potassium chloride, come as fully prepared chemicals.  Jan. 30 Tr.\n14 -15.   The first chemical, thiopental, comes from the manufacturer as a powder.\nJan. 30 Tr. 13.  One mixes the powder that comes in a container with the supplied\ndiluent.  Jan. 30 Tr. 14.  The district court refers to no episode where Dr. Doe\naccidently gave an incorrect amount of thiopental to the condemned due to improper\nmixing.  The concerns by the district court are not well grounded in the record.\nThe recent difficulty experienced by Dr. Doe in mixing thiopental that resulted\nin less than five grams of this chemical being administered in recent executions was\nthe result of attempting to mix it at a high concentration.  App. 645-46, 672-75.  The\nwritten protocol removes this difficulty because it provides that the five grams of\nthiopental will be administered in 200cc of solution,   App. 215; Add. 32 (§B.2),\n44\n\nwhich is the standard 2 ½ % solution (25 mg per mL [equivalent to cc]) that can be\nprepared  exactly  as  the  manufacturer  intended.    App.  226,  1252.    Thus,  the\npreparation of the thiopental will no longer present the problems dealt with by Dr.\nDoe.  It is also important to recognize that even the amounts of thiopental given in\nrecent executions – at least 2.5 grams – were more than adequate to render the\ncondemned prisoner unconscious and unaware of any pain from the succeeding\nchemicals.  June Tr. 220-22, 241, 264-65.\nThe district court’s fourth criticism of Missouri’s protocol is that Dr. Doe was\nunable to monitor anesthetic depth.  App. 198-99; Add. 21-22.  To support this\ncriticism, the court found that Dr. Doe could not see the facial expression of the\ncondemned because the condemned is facing away from the operations room where\nDr. Doe is located.  App. 198; Add. 21.  But Dr. Doe testified that the offender’s\nfacial expression could be seen from his position in the operations room, a room\nadjacent to the room where the condemned is on a gurney.  App. 676-78.   And this\ntestimony can be confirmed by the court’s review of Exhibit 47, the videotape of the\nexecution room.  The district court also found that it was dark in the operations room.\nApp. 198-99; Add. 21-22.  But the condemned is in the adjacent execution room\nwhere the fluorescent lights shine brightly.  Exhibit 47 (videotape).  The district court\nalso noted there were blinds on the windows between the operation room and the\nexecution room.  App. 198-99; Add.21-22.  These blinds are partially open during an\n45\n\nexecution so that the offender can be observed from the operations room.  App. 676-\n78; Exhibit 47 (videotape).  \nFinally, the Corrections defendants note that issues such as the positioning of\nthe condemned prisoner in the execution room, the lighting in the operations room,\nand contingency plans have been addressed by the written protocol, App. 216-17;\nAdd.  33-34  (§§  B.8  to  B.9,  C.1,  D.2,  E.4,  E.10),  to  the  district  court’s  later\nsatisfaction.  App. 373; Add. 27.\nWritten Protocol Consistent with Eighth Amendment\nAs noted above, following the district court’s June 26 order disapproving\nMissouri’s execution procedures and directing the submission of a written protocol\nfor the court’s review, the Department of Corrections prepared a detailed protocol.\nBut the court has also found this wanting in certain respects.\nThe district court’s primary dissatisfaction with the new protocol appears to be\nits failure to require that a doctor trained in the use of anesthesia (1) prepare and\nadminister, or oversee the preparation and administration, of the chemicals used and\n(2) monitor the anesthetic depth of the condemned prisoner.  App.  200-01, 373-74;\nAdd. 23-24, 27-28.  These concerns are considered in Points III and IV.\nThe district court also seemed to criticize the auditing process in the proposed\nprotocol.  The court directed that the “Sequence of Chemicals” form, which is to\n46\n\nverify that the chemicals have been given in the proper order, be signed by the staff\nmembers taking part in an execution as soon as the inmate had been declared dead.\nApp. 373; Add. 27.  But that is already required by the protocol.  “Before leaving\nERDCC (the prison), all members of the execution team complete and sign the\n‘Sequence of Chemicals’ form thereby verifying that the chemicals were given in the\norder specified in this protocol.”  App. 218; Add. 35 (§F.2).  The only difference that\ndefendants can perceive may be a matter of timing, with the district court wanting the\nform signed “as soon as the inmate has been declared dead,” whereas the Department\nprotocol specifies that it will be signed before the execution team leaves the prison.\n The district court does not articulate the constitutional significance for any difference\nit perceived.  The court also ordered that the doctor sign the chemical log.  App. 374;\nAdd. 28.  The protocol provides that “medical personnel” fulfill this function.  App.\n218; Add. 35 (§F.3).  To the extent the court’s disagreement is that a doctor is\nrequired, the issue is addressed in the following Points.  \nThe  district  court  also  suggested  that  “the  State  may  have  to  purchase\nadditional equipment in order to adequately monitor anesthetic depth.”  App. 200,\n373; Add. 23, 27.  Although the verb used is discretionary – “the State may have to\npurchase” – the court offers no alternative option after rejecting the reasonable\nproposal of the defendant prison officials.  \n47\n\nThe monitoring provisions of the Department’s protocol already require a\nmedical person to assess the consciousness of the condemned prisoner by observation\nand by means of various clinical techniques, to inspect the catheter site, and to\nmonitor an electrocardiograph machine .  App. 216-17; Add. 33-34 (§§E.3 & D.2 to\nD.3).  It is unclear if the district court is suggesting the purchase of “additional\nequipment” in lieu of these monitoring provisions or in addition to them.  \nThe only equipment discussed in the June hearing was a machine called a “BIS\nMonitor.”  June Tr. 275-76.  While North Carolina has used a BIS Monitor, June Tr.\n279, it does not appear that it is under a court order to do so.  The anecdotal evidence\nfrom North Carolina shows that its use of three grams of thiopental (60% of the\namount used in Missouri) was sufficient to produce the “lowest measurable level of\nconsciousness [as shown by the BIS Monitor] that one can achieve medically.”  June\nTr. 280.  While a BIS Monitor may be useful, it cannot be constitutionally required\nby the Eighth Amendment considering that North Carolina is the only state that\ndefendants are aware of that uses one.7  Taylor may reply that the district court did not\n7There has been no finding by the district court that such a monitor is even\navailable to Missouri.  The maker of the BIS Monitor, Aspect Medical Systems, “is\nvery much opposed to its use in executions for several reasons.”  App. 223.  “Doctors\nat Aspect Medical Systems, which makes the device, have said they would not have\nsold one to the state if they had known its intended use.”  http://cftj.org/html/\nmodules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1354 (Last visited November 30, 2006).\n48\n\nmandate use of a BIS Monitor.  That may be true, but it leaves the state to guess what\n“equipment” it may need to purchase.\nThe district court also required that “any deviations from this written protocol\nshall be a matter of written record submitted to the appropriate state officials.”  App.\n374; Add. 28.  The court did not articulate its meaning.  Who are “the appropriate\nstate officials?”  And what is “a matter of written record?”   And what if the deviation\nwere deemed necessary by the Director, App. 215; Add. 32 (§B.1), at 11:30 p.m\nbefore the execution day opened, or at 11:55 p.m.?\nNo Risk of Any Pain under Current or Former Lethal Injection Procedures\nAny deficiencies in the written protocol, or in the previously existing lethal\ninjection process, are, in any event, all overcome by one overriding fact:  the amount\nof the first chemical injected at an execution, five grams of thiopental, is so massive\nthat  there  is    no  risk  that  the  succeeding  chemicals  will  cause  any  pain  to  a\ncondemned prisoner.  As defendants’ expert, Dr. Dershwitz, testified:\nQ.  If five grams of thiopental was administered at an execution,\nand let’s assume that it’s actually brought into the body, is there any\nneed for a monitoring of the anesthetic depth of the condemned prisoner,\nin your view?\nA.  I don’t think it’s necessary.\nQ.  And can you tell us why not?\n49\n\nA.  Because it is inconceivable that there’s any human who could\npossibly remain awake after such a large dose of thiopental being\nproperly administered into a working intravenous catheter.\nQ.   Would the same be true at a somewhat lower dose of\nthiopental, say 2.5 grams?\nA.  Yes.  And in fact, I have testified elsewhere that even doses as\nlow  as  1.5  grams  will  provide  a  high  enough  probability  of\nunconsciousness so that, in my opinion, an execution would be humane.\n(June Tr. 284).   Dr. Dershwitz explained the science underlying this conclusion.\nA.  Well, first of all, unconsciousness will be achieved once the\nfirst two to 300 milligrams circulate, and that will take, you know,\ntypically 30 seconds to 45 seconds in the average person.  And so as\nincreasing  amounts  of  thiopental  are  given,  from  the  person’s\nperspective who is receiving the drug nothing is different because once\nunconsciousness is achieved, the depth of unconsciousness, although\nperceptible to a clinician who is looking at an EEG, is not perceptible to\na  person  receiving  the  drug.    And  so  once  the  first  few  hundred\nmilligrams circulate, which typically take 30 to 45 seconds, the person\nis unconscious and they will remain unconscious for quite a period of\ntime after the rest of the dose is given.\nJune Tr. 286.  Because of the massive amount of thiopental that is given the\ncondemned, it is not possible that he will be conscious when the other two chemicals\nare administered.  See Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005),\ncert. denied, 543 U.S. 1096 (2005); Evans v. Saar, 412 F. Supp. 2d 519, 521 (D. Md.\n2006); Abdur’rahman, 181 S.W.3d at 307-08.\n50\n\nIII.\nThe  district  court  erred  in  ruling  that  the  Eighth  Amendment\nconstitutionally requires that a doctor prepare and administer, or oversee the\npreparation and administration, of the chemicals used at executions and that a\ndoctor monitor the anesthetic depth of the condemned prisoner because the\nanesthetic used, thiopental, is simple to prepare and can be appropriately\nadministered by a nurse or emergency medical technician, and the five grams of\nthiopental administered will render the condemned deeply unconscious and\nunaware of the administration of the subsequent chemicals and their effects.\nWith or without the assistance of a doctor, executions in Missouri, both as\npreviously conducted and as now formalized in a written protocol, are humane and\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, even under the “unreasonable risk” standard\napplied by the district court.  Five grams (in excess of 10 times the typical amount\nadministered for surgical procedures, June Tr. 301 (typical amount of thiopental used\nin surgical procedures is a few hundred milligrams)) of thiopental are administered\nin the execution process.  App. 215, 217; Add. 32, 34 (§§ B.2 & E.2); June Tr. 301.\nThis  amount  will  render  the  condemned  deeply  unconscious  (a  level  of\nunconsciousness deeper than that used for surgical procedures) and unaware of the\n51\n\nadministration of the subsequent chemicals and their effects.  Jan. 30 Tr. 24-26; June\nTr. 232-36, 256-57, 273-74; App. 389-414. \nInitially, the district court ordered that a board certified anesthesiologist must\nassist in the execution process.  App. 200; Add. 23.  The court later modified its order\nto require the assistance of a doctor “trained in the administration and application of\nanesthetic drugs” to oversee the preparation and administration of the chemicals used\nin executions.  App. 373; Add. 27.  This directive that a doctor must monitor the\nexecution process imposes a condition that is not required by the Constitution.\nEighth Amendment Does Not Demand Doctor at Execution\nEven if it is possible for the Department of Corrections to find a doctor trained\nin the use of anesthesia to provide services during executions, the district court\nlegally erred in imposing such a requirement.  Assistance of a doctor at an execution\nhas never been determined to be constitutionally required.  Because the district\ncourt’s order imposed a condition that is not constitutionally necessary, the court\nexceeded its remedial powers.\nAlthough defendants have had difficulty in determining how many states\nconduct judicially approved executions without the assistance of a doctor, it appears\nfrom reported opinions that at least two states engage in lethal injection executions\nwithout the presence of a doctor of any kind.  Abdur’rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d\n292, 301 (Tenn. 2005) (describing a process in which the prison warden prepares the\n52\n\ndrugs and a non-physician prison official injects the drugs; a physician is on site only\nto perform a “cut down” procedure in the event the paramedics, two of whom are\npresent at the execution, are unable to insert an IV in the condemned’s arm), cert.\ndenied, 126 S.

App. 2006) (pharmacist mixing chemicals).\nEvans v. Saar is the one case defendants have found that examines the issue of\nwhether the assistance of a doctor is required during executions.  In that case, the\ncondemned prisoner plaintiff, expressing concern that the execution team members\nmight not be adequately qualified, sought an injunction to stay his execution.  412 F.\nSupp. 2d at 524.  The evidence established that at executions a certified nursing\nassistant establishes the IV and sees that fluids are flowing properly through the line.\n53\n\nId.  This person then monitors the execution procedure through a window.  Id.  The\nwarden and a religious advisor stand near the condemned prisoner from where,\nalthough not medically trained, they can determine whether any major problems\noccur, such as a leak in the IV line.  Id.  The court found these qualifications adequate\nand denied the injunction.  Id. at 525.  See also Bieghler v. State, 839 N.E.2d 691,\n695-96 (Ind. 2005) (denying habeas relief despite challenge that state had not\ndeveloped its execution protocol with input from a person trained in anesthesiology),\ncert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1190 (2006).\nNeither Taylor nor the district court has identified a state in which a state or\nfederal court constitutionally mandates the use of a doctor to prepare the chemicals\nor to oversee the mixing of the chemicals.  And looking at execution more broadly,\nneither Taylor nor the district court has shown a decision where the Constitution has\nbeen found to require a doctor to have any role in any form of execution:  gas,\nhanging, or electric chair.  And looking at capital punishment even more broadly,\nneither Taylor nor the district court has shown an Eighth Amendment decision that\nrequires any particular person or trade or guild have any particular role with an\nexecution process.  That is not to say that the use of such persons is or is not good\npolicy, it only states that it is not a topic that the federal constitution regulates.8  \n8The district court also required the doctor selected by the state to be “in good\nstanding” with the licensing board and “not have any disciplinary action taken against\n54\n\nNot even the decision in Morales v. Hickman, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (N.D. Cal.\n2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006),\nwhich Taylor has relied on, requires use of a doctor at the execution.  Although the\ncourt approved the three-drug execution protocol only if a doctor with formal training\nand experience in the field of general anesthesia took part, it also approved execution\nby  means  of  a  massive  dose  of  thiopental  alone  or  some  other  barbiturate  or\ncombination of barbiturates, without any direction that a doctor be present.  415 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1047.\nFurther, the evidence presented to the district court in this case establishes that\nan execution can occur without unnecessary and wanton pain without the presence\nof a doctor.  The protocol developed by the Department of Corrections complies with\nthis constitutional standard, as well as with the “unreasonable risk” standard used by\nthe district court.  \nTaylor’s own expert, Dr. Henthorn, testified that once a five gram dose of\nthiopental takes effect to the level of “burst suppression,” which will likely occur in\nless than two minutes, “there is no chance that there would be any conscious\nthem.”  App. 374; Add. 28.  While that may be good policy, it does not appear to be\ngrounded in the Eighth Amendment.  Perhaps another reading of this requirement is\nthat the doctor selected shall not be subject to any disciplinary action by the licensing\nauthority due to participation in an execution.  But, if this is what is meant, the district\ncourt offers no authority to support its attempt to provide immunity from disciplinary\naction.\n55\n\nrecognition of pain” by a condemned prisoner as the succeeding chemicals are\nadministered.9  June Tr. 195, 234.  “Burst suppression” is complete unconsciousness.\nJune Tr. 235.  Once “burst suppression” is reached following administration of five\ngrams of thiopental, a person will remain at that level of unconsciousness for a\nminimum of 45 minutes (and probably closer to the longer estimate of Dr. Dershwitz,\ndefendants’ expert).10  June Tr. 233-35.  And, when that level of unconsciousness is\nreached, there is no longer any need to monitor the level of unconsciousness.  June\nTr. 236-37.\nDr. Henthorn’s concern with the lethal execution procedure was that the second\ntwo chemicals could be given before the first chemical had enough time to bring the\ncondemned prisoner to the “burst suppression” level of unconsciousness.11  June Tr.\n200-01.  His studies indicated that “burst suppression” would be reached within three\nminutes even for thiopental doses of two grams.  App. 1324, 1327-28.  \n9Even administration of as little as 1.67 grams of thiopental will render almost\neveryone unconscious to a level of “burst suppression” within minutes.  June Tr. 233.\n10Of course, with a five gram dose of thiopental, death would result, instead of\njust unconsciousness, unless the recipient received life support assistance.  Jan. 30 Tr.\n21-22.\n11Ironically, during the initial appeal, Taylor’ theory of the case was that remand\nfor further hearing would show that Missouri’s protocol was too slow because it\nallowed “the rapid decline of levels of thiopental.”  Appellant’s Brief in Taylor v.\nCrawford, No. 06-1397, at p. 50).  Then before the district court, Dr. Henthorn’s\nanalysis was that the speed of injection was too quick.  June Tr. 200-01.\n56\n\nAlthough  defendants’  expert  disagrees  that  “burst  suppression”  must  be\nreached before the second and third chemicals may be administered without painful\neffect, June Tr. 273-74,12 defendants’ protocol takes into account Dr. Henthorn’s\nconcern.  The protocol provides that the second and third chemicals will not be\nadministered until at least three minutes have elapsed since administration of the\nthiopental.  App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.5).  Thus, even under Taylor’s evidence, once the\nfive grams of thiopental called for by the protocol are administered and given time\nto take effect, there is no foreseeable risk that the condemned prisoner will experience\nunnecessary and wanton pain from the administration of the second or the third\nchemicals.13\n12“Burst suppression is a much deeper level of unconsciousness than that targeted\nfor surgical procedures.  June Tr. 235-36, 273.\n13It is also worth considering the old adage that one should not fail to see the\nforest for the trees.  All the appropriate concern shown throughout this case that\ncondemned prisoners be unconscious before the second and third chemicals are\nadministered so that they not be aware of any pain, neglects consideration of whether\nthe pain that might result, in the absence of anesthesia, rises to the level of cruel and\nunusual punishment.  No one has testified that the second chemical, pancuronium\nbromide, causes pain.  The defendants’ expert, Dr. Dershwitz, testified without\ncontradiction that the pain resulting from the third chemical, potassium chloride,\nentering the heart is comparable to the pain experienced by a person having a heart\nattack.  June Tr. 288-90.  The pain, from either the administration of potassium\nchloride or a heart attack, would last approximately ten seconds.  June Tr. 289-90.\nIt should be difficult to conclude that the level of pain experienced by persons having\nheart attacks, a leading cause of death, is a level of pain that, in the context of a\njudicially authorized execution, is cruel and unusual.\n57\n\nDoctor Not Necessary to Assure Proper Administration of Thiopental\nTaylor has asserted that a doctor must participate in the lethal injection process\nto assure that some error in the setting of the IV, difficulty in the mixing of the\nthiopental, or other untoward event will not prevent the condemned prisoner from\nactually receiving the full amount of thiopental.  Taylor’s challenge, however, fails\non several counts.\nFirst, as noted above, “[t]he risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated\nfrom the execution process in order to survive constitutional review.”  Campbell v.\nWood, 18 F. 3d 662, 687 (9th Cir. 1994).  “The Supreme Court has rejected Eighth\nAmendment  challenges  based  on  an  ‘unforeseeable  accident.’”  Beardslee  v.\nWoodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Louisiana ex rel. Francis v.\nResweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947)).  Therefore Taylor’s suggestion that, in the\nabsence of a doctor’s participation, mistakes are possible does not provide any\nconstitutional basis for requiring modifications to the protocol.\nMoreover, failure of the IV line to deliver the thiopental as expected is self-\ncorrecting.  If a problem with the IV (such as a kink, a clog, or a leak) stops the\nthiopental from entering the body, the same problem would also prevent the other two\nchemicals from entering the body.  And if the other two chemicals do not enter the\nbody, they cannot cause any pain to the condemned.\n58\n\nAdditionally, the written protocol developed by the Department of Corrections\nimplements  steps  that  provide  assurance  that  the  thiopental  is  prepared  and\nadministered  appropriately.    A  doctor,  nurse,  or  pharmacist  is  to  prepare  the\nthiopental.  App. 215; Add. 32 (§A.2).  This is a straight-forward matter of mixing a\npowder with a liquid found in a manufacturer’s kit.  See Evans, 412 F. Supp. 2d at\n524-25; Jan. 30 Tr. 30-31.  Two IV lines are set by either a doctor, a nurse, or an\nemergency medical technician (EMT-intermediate or EMT-paramedic).14  App. 215-\n16; Add. 32-33 (§§A.3, C.1).  The setting of IV lines is a procedure within the\ncompetence of nurses and EMTs.15  Reid v. Johnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543, 546 n.6\n14Taylor  has  expressed  concern  that  medical  personnel  not  trained  and\nexperienced in the setting of central lines will be setting central lines under the\nprotocol.  But the protocol does not mandate use of central lines.  The protocol\ncontemplates that the medical person present for the execution will set only the types\nof IV lines for which he or she is trained and has experience with.  Not only does the\nprotocol not provide for nurses or emergency medical technicians to set central lines\nbeyond their experience and training, but it does not require a doctor to set such a line\neither.  Doctors qualified to set either central or peripheral lines are to exercise their\njudgment to determine which type of line is most appropriate in the circumstances.\n15The provision that permits an EMT to set IV lines and to check them for\nobstructions is not a step back from previous Department of Corrections practice of\nobtaining the presence of a doctor at executions.  Permitting the medical roles to be\nfilled by an EMT is only a foresighted recognition that there may be a time that the\npresence of a doctor cannot be obtained.  In such a case Corrections will plan to go\nforward with the execution with the aid of an EMT, just as it would have had a doctor\nnot been available in the past.  Missouri’s proceeding with an execution with an\nEMT, is comparable to Maryland’s use of a certified nursing assistant.  Evans, 412\nF. Supp. 2d at 524.  The intent of the Department of Corrections, however, is to\nobtain the presence of a doctor at executions if possible.\n59\n\n(E.D. Va. 2004); State v. Webb, 750 A.2d 448, 452 (Conn. 2000), cert. denied, 121\nS. Ct. 93 (2000).  At the time the IV lines are set, they are checked to make certain\nthey are not obstructed.  App. 216; Add. 33 (§C.2). \nThe written protocol also provides that, between the administration of the first\nchemical and the second two chemicals, the medical person who has set the IV line\nwill return to the execution room and directly assess whether the condemned is\nconscious.  App. 217; Add. 34 (§E.3).  Although the Department of Corrections\nprefers to have the assistance of a doctor if possible, in the event that one is not\navailable, a nurse or an emergency medical technician will be present.  App. 215;\nAdd. 32 (§A.3).  Doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians have the ability\nto assess level of consciousness to the extent that they can be confident that a person\nis sufficiently unconscious to be unaware of any pain that would normally be the\nresult  of  noxious  stimuli,  including  the  pain  expected  to  accompany  the\nadministration of 240 milliequivalents of potassium chloride contained in 120 mL of\nsolution.  App. 371B (¶ 8).  This is especially so when there is no concern that the\nlevel of unconsciousness may be too deep.  App. 371B (¶ 8).  The direct assessment\nof the condemned prisoner by the medical person present will provide reasonable\nassurance that the condemned prisoner will be unconscious when the second and third\nchemicals are administered and  bring any risk of consciousness on the condemned’s\npart below the level of foreseeable risk of unnecessary and wanton pain.\n60\n\nThe protocol further provides that the medical person present is to examine the\nIV catheter site following the administration of the thiopental.  App. 217; Add. 34\n(§E.3).  Doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians who have set IV lines\nare qualified to examine their lines and the line entry sites after administration of\nflush or chemicals to insure that the IV line is operating correctly and that the flush\nor chemicals have actually entered the blood stream.  App. 371A-371B (¶¶ 3-6).  By\nexamination of the IV after administration of the thiopental, any risk that the\nthiopental has not entered the blood stream as expected is negligible. \nGiven the safeguards incorporated into the protocol, there is no foreseeable risk\nthat the condemned will be subject to unnecessary and wanton pain through any\nfailure to receive the full five grams of thiopental.\nMandating Use of a Doctor Exceeded District Court’s Remedial Powers\nAs  shown  above,  the  written  protocol  developed  by  the  Department  of\nCorrections provides an ample level of confidence that condemned prisoners executed\nunder its provisions will not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\nA court may exercise its equity power only on the basis of a constitutional\nviolation.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1276 (1971).\n“The  court’s  exercise  of  equitable  discretion  must  heel  close  to  the  identified\nviolation and respect ‘the interests of state and local authorities in managing their\nown affairs, consistent with the Constitution.’”  Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987,\n61\n\n1005 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 2757 (1977)).  See\nalso Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, (9th Cir. 1986) (“Injunctive relief against\na  state  agency  or  official  must  be  no  broader  than  necessary  to  remedy  the\nconstitutional violation”), cert. denied, 107 S. Ct. 2462 (1987); 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(1)\n(“Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend\nno further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular\nplaintiff or plaintiff”).\nThe district court’s order to the Corrections defendants to include assistance\nof a doctor at executions goes beyond its power under these standards.  As discussed\nabove, no court has ever found that assistance of a doctor is constitutionally required\nat an execution.  Moreover, there is no necessity here, considering the evidence\nadduced and the protocol developed by the Department of Corrections, to require the\nassistance of a doctor at executions in Missouri.  Conducting executions under the\nprotocol, with or without a doctor, will result in no reasonably foreseeable risk that\nthe condemned prisoner will experience unnecessary and wanton pain.  Thus, the\ndistrict court’s imposition of a requirement that a doctor take part in executions, was\nbroader than necessary to remedy any justified constitutional concerns.  Therefore,\nthe court’s imposition of this requirement exceeded its authority.  \n62\n\nIV.\nThe district court erred in mandating that a doctor assist at executions\nbecause compliance with such a requirement could be impossible to fulfill, and\nthereby effectively bar implementation of the death penalty in Missouri,  in that\ndoctor participation in executions is inconsistent with some interpretations of a\ndoctor’s ethical duties.\nThere is also a very practical reason why the district court’s requirement that\na doctor be involved in the execution process should be reversed:  it may be\nimpossible  to  find  a  doctor  willing  to  assist,  especially  one  trained  in  the\nadministration of anesthesia.  \nFollowing the court’s June 26 order that a board certified anesthesiologist be\nfound to participate in executions, the reaction of the anesthesiologist community\nwas swift and hostile.  The June 30, 2006, message from the President of the\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologist to member anesthesiologist is perhaps best\nsummarized by its last two words of advice: “[s]teer clear.”  App. 225.  So they have.\nThe Department of Corrections sent letters to 298 board certified anesthesiologists\nin this state and southern Illinois inquiring of their willingness to participate in\nexecutions, as outlined by the court’s order.   None accepted.  App. 219. \n63\n\nEven assuming the modified order requiring only the participation of a doctor\ntrained in the use of anesthesia widened the pool of candidates, there exists a real\npossibility that a doctor willing to take part cannot be found.  As Taylor alleged in his\namended  complaint,  a  doctor’s  participation  in  an  execution  is  a  violation  of\nprofessional ethical standards as interpreted by the American Medical Association.\nApp. 65-66 (¶ 81), 100-01 (AMA’s Code of Ethics, E-2.06).  See also Beardslee v.\nWoodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1074 (9th Cir. 2005) (“lethal injection executions are\nhampered by ethical restrictions on physicians, who are prohibited from participating\nin executions”).  The ethical standards of the AMA are not necessarily binding on\nMissouri’s medical licensing board, but could carry decisive weight with that board\nin the event charges were filed against a doctor who did participate in an execution.\nThus, a requirement that a doctor participate at executions could effectively bar\nimplementation of the death penalty in Missouri.\nIn response to the Department’s concern that it may be impossible to obtain the\nservices of a doctor at executions, Taylor has presented a journal article showing that\na significant portion of doctors have indicated a willingness to take part in executions.\nApp.347-53.  But the article addresses only the willingness of doctors in general to\ntake  part,  rather  than  of  the  narrower subset  of  doctors  trained  in  the  use  of\nanesthesia.  There is also quite a difference between responding positively to a survey\nas a general matter and actually agreeing to assist with executions, followed by\n64\n\nfulfillment of the agreement.  Additionally, the article cited was written five years ago\nand so has questionable relevance to current attitudes of doctors.  \nRegardless of the difficulty in finding a doctor to participate in executions, the\nDepartment of Corrections prefers to have the assistance of a doctor, and continues\nits efforts to find one who will take part.  But, in the event a doctor cannot be found,\nthe written protocol permits the completion of an execution with the participation of\na nurse, pharmacist, or emergency medical technician only.  App. 215; Add. 32 (§A.2\n& A.3).  As discussed in Point III, the safeguards included in the protocol that assure\nthe unconsciousness of the condemned prisoner before the administration of the\nsecond two chemicals render the services of a doctor unnecessary.  \nIn  particular,  the  examination  of the  IV  line  after  administration  of  the\nthiopental  will  provide  confidence  that  the  thiopental  has  actually  entered  the\ncondemned’s blood stream.  Then the three minute time lag time between the\nadministration of the thiopental and the administration of the succeeding chemicals\nwill provide confidence that the massive dose of thiopental has had time to take full\neffect before the succeeding chemicals are administered.  These steps, mandated by\nthe protocol, will provide appropriate assurance that the condemned prisoner is\ncompletely unconscious before the administration of the second two chemicals and,\nthereby, render an assessment of anesthetic depth by a doctor a needless redundancy.\nThe protocol, as written, does not subject condemned prisoners to any foreseeable\n65\n\nrisk of unnecessary and wanton pain.  The substitution of a nurse, a pharmacist, or an\nemergency medical technician to carry out the steps committed to medical personnel\nby the protocol at an execution when a doctor is not available is reasonable and\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment.\n66\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs demonstrated above, Missouri’s lethal injection procedure is consistent with\nthe Eighth Amendment.  The Corrections defendants urge this Court to reverse the\ndistrict court’s entry of judgment against them, to vacate the district court’s orders\nimposing conditions on, and continuing oversight over, the implementation of their\nexecution procedure against plaintiff Taylor and other condemned prisoners, and to\nremand this case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in their favor.\nExecutions in Missouri should be allowed to proceed as provided in its written\nprotocol.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEREMIAH W.

ed counsel for \nMichael Taylor faxed the Missouri Supreme Court a copy of this district court’s order \nholding that the action needed to go forward—the Missouri Supreme Court set a \nFebruary 1, 2006, execution date. \nThe next day, counsel filed an application for stay of execution with the Missouri \nSupreme Court, attaching a copy of the district court’s order.  (Attachment 5.)  Several \ndays later, counsel received a response from the defendants’ co‐counsel.  (Attachment \n6.)  The next day, January 13, 2005, the undersigned counsel for Michael Taylor filed a \nreply.  (Attachment 7.) \nIn a telephone conference beginning at 9:51 a.m. on Wednesday, January 18, \n2006, the district court informed counsel for all parties that it would set an evidentiary \nhearing in this matter for February 21, 2006, with the hearing to extend to February 22, \n2006, should the district court need a second day to complete taking the evidence in the \nmatter.  Counsel were informed that the district court had attempted to schedule the \nhearing in time to decide the case before February 1, 2006, but that it would have been \nimpossible to do so.  Counsel for the defendants presented neither argument or \nevidence against the district court’s entering the order under discussion, but instead \ninformed the district court that they would seek to overturn any order that their clients’ \nexecution of plaintiff Taylor not proceed according to their schedule. \nAt 10:34 on January 18, the undersigned counsel for Michael Taylor faxed to the \nMissouri Supreme Court a supplemental notice in support of his pending application \n \n\nfor a stay from that court.  (Attachment 8.)  In a subsequent fax to that court, he \nrequested a call on his cellular phone if the clerk had any information to convey in the \nmatter.  (Attachment 9.)  By the end of the afternoon, he had received no response.  \nOnly after giving the Missouri Supreme Court an opportunity to stay its ordered \nexecution or to vacate its execution warrant without prejudice to setting another \nexecution date if the district court ruled against the plaintiffs. \nThroughout this litigation and the previous litigation over the Missouri lethal \ninjection procedure, the defendants have asserted in pleadings and affidavits or \ndeclarations, and admitted in the discovery they have chosen to respond to, that they \nuse the three‐chemical sequence to which the original complaint was directed and that \nthey also use a central‐line access and a licensed physician, to which the amended \ncomplaint was also directed.  (E.g., Application to Vacate [filed by defendants in this \nCourt January 20, 2006] Exhibit F at 1‐2 (no change from procedure and practices used \nto execute Timothy Johnston planned for executions of these plaintiffs) & 6‐7 (use of \ncentral‐line access and licensed physician).) \nThe same day that the district court entered its order requiring the defendants \nnot to execute plaintiff Taylor until further order of the court, with any such order to be \nissued within a reasonable time after the hearing on February 21 or February 21‐22, the \ndefendants filed a notice of appeal to this Court.  (Attachment 10.)  On Friday, January \n20, 2006, they faxed the Eighth Circuit an “application” to vacate the district court’s \npreliminary injunction. \nOn Sunday, January 29, 2006, a panel of the Eighth Circuit issued an order \nvacating the district judge’s preliminary injunction, a panel of the Eighth Circuit \n \n\nordered that the Chief Judge of the district court reassign the section 1983 action to \nanother district judge, and that the latter district judge conduct a hearing immediately \nand render judgment by noon on Wednesday, February 1, 2006.  It issued a stay of \nexecution through 11:59 p.m. on Friday, February 3, 2006. \nRespondents, represented by the hundreds of attorneys in the Office of the \nAttorney General, have both conducted their end of the immediate “hearing,” which \nwas entirely by telephone and excluded over objection several witnesses that the \npetitioner’s counsel sought to present, and filed an application to vacate the three‐day \nstay by the Eighth Circuit.  Because the Eighth Circuit truncated the section 1983 action \nbeyond recognition, the plaintiff‐intervenor dismissed without prejudice and the \nintervenor‐application withdrew his application to intervene, leaving the undersigned \nsole practitioner to handle the immediate hearing in the truncated section 1983 action \nalone.  He has been unable to seek relief from the Eighth Circuit’s defenestration of the \nexperienced district judge who had denied the motion to dismiss and had scheduled a \nhearing for February 21. \nDiscussion \nI.  Under the applicable standard of review, Taylor was entitled to have the \nEighth Circuit uphold the preliminary injunction which the district court \nentered in order to allow it to hear the case adequately. \nIn reliance on the defense which is before this Court on certiorari in Hill v. Crosby, \nNo. 05‐8794, the state petitioners here argue that the standard of review is the same as it \nwould be if Taylor had filed a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition.  \nApplication at 5‐6.  Nothing could be further from the truth. \n \n\nA district court’s decision to order parties to maintain the status quo in order to \ngive it a chance to decide a matter within its jurisdiction is reviewable only for abuse of \ndiscretion.  Bell v. Sellevold, 713 F.2d 1396, 1399 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1070 \n(1984).  The standard of review of a district court’s entry of a preliminary injunction is \nabuse of discretion.  Ashcroft v. Amer. Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. 656, 664 (2004).  In \nEmerson Elec. Co. v. Rogers, 418 F.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit \nexplained:  “A district court has broad discretion when ruling on preliminary injunction \nrequests, and we will reverse only for clearly erroneous factual determinations, an error \nof law, or an abuse of discretion.  United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1179 \n(8th Cir.1998).”  It has amplified on this standard of review, collecting cases, in Aaron v. \nTarget Corp., 357 F.3d 768, 773‐74 (8th Cir. 2004): \n  A district court has broad discretion when ruling on a request for \npreliminary injunction, and it will be reversed only for clearly erroneous \nfactual determinations, an error of law, or an abuse of its discretion.  \nUnited Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1179 (8th Cir.1998).  . . .  \nThe abuse of discretion standard means that a court has a “range of \nchoice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within \nthat range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.”  Verizon \nCommunications, Inc. v. Inverizon Intʹl, Inc., 295 F.3d 870, 873 (8th Cir.2002) \n(citing Kern v. TXO Prod. Corp., 738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir.1984)).  An abuse \nof discretion occurs if a relevant factor that should have been given \nsignificant weight is not considered, if an irrelevant or improper factor is \nconsidered and given significant weight, or if a court commits a clear error \nof judgment in the course of weighing proper factors.  Id. \nBecause appellate review of a district court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction \nis only for abuse of discretion, an appellate could which might have handled the matter \ndifferently in the first instance “should uphold the injunction” and remand for a \nhearing on the merits even ‘[i]f the underlying constitutional question is close.’”  \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region, Inc. v. Nixon, 428 \n \n\nF.3d 1139, 1145 (8th Cir. 2004), quoting Ashcroft v. Amer. Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. at \n664‐65. \nII.  The district courts’ order—which the defendants and their privies made \nnecessary by seeking and setting an execution date while the case was pending—did \nnot turn this section 1983 complaint into a successive section 2254 petition. \nDefendants attempt to shoehorn the district court’s preliminary injunction into \n28 U.S.C. § 2254 by arguing that the district court did not specify by what means the \ndefendants could not execute plaintiff Taylor.  (AVDCOPE:4‐5.)1  They argue that \nbecause the district court forbade them to execute plaintiff Taylor until after its hearing \nin the case without specifying that the execution would be the kind of execution which \nthey have pleaded and given affidavits that they would use, the whole action ceased to \nbe a civil case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and became, instead, a petition under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2254.  That makes no sense, but if it were accepted, the plaintiff could not have \nbrought the action in the first place based on the district court’s response, seven months \nlater, to the defendants’ privy’s setting an execution date immediately after the district \ncourt denied a motion to dismiss. \nDefendants could have raised this objection in the district court, either in the \ntelephone conference in which all counsel were informed of the district court’s hearing \non February 21, or in response to the district court’s solicitation the defendants’ \ncounsel’s review of the order the district court intended to issue.  The court’s \n                                                 \n1\nThe state officials (petitioners here, defendants in the district court) make mostly \nthe same arguments in this Court for vacating the Eighth Circuit’s stay that they made \nfor vacating the district court’s preliminary injunction.  Taylor cites to their pleading in \nthe Eighth Circuit by its initials, “AVDCOPE.” \n \n\ninformation was clear that it was not attempting to fine‐tune the state’s execution plans \nwithout the benefit of a hearing, and the court indicated that the defendants’ counsel \nshould advise it of any problem they had with the order it directed plaintiff Taylor’s \ncounsel to draft.  He, in turn, e‐mailed the draft to counsel for the defendants hours \nbefore the district court entered its order.  If the defendants thought the order swept \nbeyond the section 1983 action in which the district court issued it, they should have \nbrought this to the attention of the district court rather than sandbagging in the hope \nthat some other body would buy their theory that a court’s action in response to the \naction by their privy, the Missouri Supreme Court, would recast the entire litigation in \norder to bring about its dismissal. \nThe district court’s order makes clear that the order became necessary to resolve \nthe merits of the “pending” litigation, not some other litigation that it was creating in \nspite of the plaintiffs’ care in pleading their case under section 1983 rather than under \nsection 2254.  Plaintiffs are the masters of the action at this level, and have never sought, \nin this action, relief from their convictions and sentences—or even from execution by \nlethal injection per se—but only from a form of lethal injection which violates the \nConstitution of the United States.  Not only did the district court make its decision \nwithin the context of the action the plaintiffs filed—not the action the defendants wish \nthe plaintiffs had filed—but it could not denature that action if it had tried. \nIn the context of this case and of the need for preliminary injunctive relief to hold \na hearing on the merits, it would have made no sense to have requested, or ordered, \npreliminary injunctive relief other than the defendants’ simply refraining from \nexecuting plaintiff Taylor until after the hearing, scheduled for only a few weeks after \n \n\nthe district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss and only three weeks after the \nexecution date the Missouri Supreme Court set after it had been notified of the \ndismissal.  The alternative would have been for the district court to have ordered the \ndefendants not to execute him using the three‐chemical sequence, the central‐line \naccess, and the licensed physician.  Defendants have repeatedly filed pleadings and \naffidavits and—when they got around to it—discovery responses, indicating that they \nintend to perform all executions in this manner.  (E.g., Exhibit F at 1‐2 & 6‐7, supra.)  It \nwould require a hearing to establish that any new form of lethal injection the district \ncourt might have ordered rather than simply telling them to hold off on the execution \nuntil it could conduct a hearing.  If the district court could have held a hearing by \nFebruary 1, 2006, it would have held the one it has scheduled for February 21.  Given \nthe defendants’ unconstitutional response to critiques of their former botched \nexecutions, they would most likely have come up with some other alternative to the \nthree‐chemical sequence, central‐line access, and licensed physician which would have \nbeen even worse that the status quo from a constitutional and treaty point of view.  A \nfederal court order to come up with a new form of lethal injection would actually have \nbeen intrusive into the defendants’ activities—whereas corrections personnel in death‐\npenalty states know, going in, that there will be times when courts or executives tell \nthem to keep an execution on hold:  obeying such orders is part of their expected duties, \nwhereas changing execution protocols and procedures and the substance of the lethal \nacts themselves at the last minute would be highly unusual.  Such an order would not \nhave respected the rights and responsibilities of either the plaintiffs or the defendants, \n \n\nand no one should be criticized for the fact that the district court’s order proceeded on \nthe more parsimonious path. \nIn this respect, the defendants are attempting to relitigate the denial of their \nmotion to dismiss about the nature of the action ab initio.  It would stand the judicial \nprocess on its head to hold that after they have lost on a motion in which they argued \nthat this litigation was “really” a federal habeas corpus action, any court would agree \nwith them because the district court took a modest, limited action which it found \nnecessary to resolve the case on the merits. \nAlthough the plaintiffs do not regard the district court’s order as overbroad, if \nthis Court were to disagree, the remedy would be to remand with instructions rather \nthan to reach back in time and grant, at the appellate level, the motion to dismiss insofar \nas it pleaded the case was “really” a successive federal habeas corpus action.  See, e.g., \nReproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region, Inc. v. Nixon, 428 \nF.3d at 1145‐46.  Defendants and their privies should not be allowed to take an \ninterlocutory appeal on the motion to dismiss by setting an execution date in order to \nforce the district court to issue preliminary relief.  They do not like the fact that they are \nlosing in the district court, and by setting an execution date after it denied the \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss but before the district court can adjudicate the case on its \nmerits, they are attempting an illegitimate end run. \nAlthough the Court should reject the defendants’ attempt to denature this 1983 \naction on grounds common to all litigation, in this special area it bears remarking that \nthe plaintiffs could not have raised lethal injection claims in their habeas corpus \npetitions.  Defendants have not disclosed their modus operandi until the discovery in \n \n\nthe Timothy Johnston case—even then, only weeks after the district court issued an \norder compelling discovery and, to a large extent, after their privies in the Missouri \nSupreme Court had set an execution date.  That court has held a Missouri prisoner \ncannot litigate claims regarding lethal injection methods and personnel in the forms of \nstate‐court litigation which would be a prerequisite for raising such claims under \nsection 2254.  In Worthington v. State, 166 S.W.3d 566, 583 n.3 (Mo. 2005) (en banc), a \nMissouri condemned person attempted to raise such a claim in his state post‐conviction \nrelief appeal; the state court which sets execution dates held the challenge premature: \n  As it is unknown what method, if any, of lethal injection may be \nutilized by the State of Missouri at such future time, if any, as Mr. \nWorthingtonʹs right to seek relief in state and federal courts is concluded \nand his execution date and method are set, it is premature for this Court to \nconsider whether a particular method of lethal injection violates the \nEighth Amendment because it causes lingering, conscious infliction of \nunnecessary pain. \nNot only would the plaintiffs have had no opportunity to raise these claims in \nthe state courts, but at the time they filed their habeas corpus petitions there would be \nno way of saying what the state’s practices for lethal injection would be.  Defendants \nand their privies have shown time and again that they will not disclose a syllable that \nwould support even a doubt about the efficacy of their procedures and personnel for \nbringing about a speedy, painless death unless they are under the gun of a federal court \nand opposing counsel is laboring under an execution warrant, and only then, when \nbroad areas of their belated responses are subject to gag orders which hobble the \nplaintiffs’ counsel in preparation for hearings.  Only through offensive affidavits which \nthe defendants submitted in the Timothy Johnston case did these plaintiffs’ counsel \nlearn that the state uses central‐line access via the femoral vein, and a licensed \nphysician.  These facts are key elements of two of the plaintiffs’s causes of action.  They \n \n\nappear to be reactions to botched executions which occurred after or at about the same \ntime that the plaintiffs’ habeas corpus petitions were due; they did not exist within the \nlimitations period for a section 2254 petition, yet the defendants say they are the \nrelevant facts for these plaintiffs’ projected executions. \nUnless this Court wishes to make the novel holding that there is no legal or \nequitable remedy of any kind for a specific execution procedure which violates the \nEighth Amendment and other constitutional guaranties, therefore, it follows that \nbecause habeas corpus cannot provide a remedy, section 1983 does. \nIII.  Plaintiffs do not challenge lethal injection broadly, but only a narrow \nband of behavior analogous to the “cut‐down” procedure at issue in Nelson v. \nCampbell and authoritatively held to sound in section 1983. \nWhat the defendants say they are going to do to the plaintiffs subjects the \ncondemned person to a femoral central line access—an invasive and painful and \ncomplicated precursor to execution that is not medically accepted as the first form of IV \naccess.  What Missouri does is as invasive as what the Alabama defendants wanted to \ndo to Mr. Nelson—but with less justification, as Mr. Nelson had a bona fide venous‐\naccess issue, whereas these Missouri defendants have decided that all condemned \npersons, regardless of their health, will be subjected to the femoral central‐line surgical \nprocedure as a precursor to execution. \n \n\nIV.  The district court’s order acted within its discretion in holding that the \nDataphase standard supported the limited preliminary relief which it granted. \nA.  Defendants’ assertion that the plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on the \nmerits is an attempt to circumvent the district court’s denial of their motion to \ndismiss, which pleaded the same premises, and on which the district court found \nit necessary to set a hearing. \n1.  Defendants are estopped to argue unlikelihood of prevailing on the \nmerits in light of the fact that they have litigated and lost on their motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim. \nFrom the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the district court was well aware of the \nhistory of their treatment of Timothy Johnston’s constitutional grievances.  That is \nundoubtedly one reason it denied the motion to dismiss, scheduled a hearing, and \nissued a preliminary injunction to permit the hearing to proceed. \nDefendants’ reliance on the courts’ actions in the Timothy Johnston case is \nunsound because this Court did not reach the merits of that plaintiff’s claims and the \nstay was issued over the district court’s refusal to grant such relief rather than at the \ndistrict court’s instance.  Defendants rely, as well, on a grant of summary judgment \nagainst plaintiff Timothy Johnston for their assertion that their method of lethal \ninjections is constitutional.  (AVDCOPE:8.)  In that case, their counsel withheld \ndiscovery in the face of an order compelling it until the Missouri Supreme Court had set \nan execution date, then sprang new data on Mr. Johnston’s counsel and filed motions \nfor summary judgment and for an expedited hearing.  Defendants did not complete \ntheir responses to discovery until this Court denied rehearing on the denial of their \n \n\npetition for a writ of prohibition to keep the district court from requiring them to \nprovide the discovery they had agreed to provide subject to a protective order before \nthe Missouri Supreme Court set an execution date.  Mr. Johnston’s counsel was forced \nto litigate the case with one and a half hands tied behind their backs.  It should come as \nno surprise that they received an adverse holding. \nThere is no reason why the district court in this case should have deferred to \nanother district court holding rendered under the circumstances of the Johnston holding, \ninstead of setting the case for a hearing at which the defendants would not enjoy the \nelement of surprise which they created by defying a sister court’s order until their \nprivies in the Missouri Supreme Court had set an execution date. \nDefendants protestations that the sodium pentothal couldn’t possibly fail to \nanesthetize the condemned person throughout the execution are belied by their \ninsistence on using pancuronium bromide to mask the symptoms of inadequate or \ninefficient administration of sodium pentothal. \n2.  Defendants have failed to show that the state’s use of a licensed \nphysician in violation of medical ethics is constitutionally permissible when the state \nhas undertaken to enforce medical ethics. \nIn an attempt to obviate the constitutional deficiencies in their lethal‐injection \nprocedure, the defendants have committed yet another constitutional violation.  In their \napplication to proceed with an execution before the district court can take evidence on \nthis issue, they make various legal arguments and some amateur medical‐ethics \narguments.  Far from making it appear that the plaintiff has no likelihood of succeeding \non the merits, the defendants’ arguments are practically contradictory in typical “guilty \n \n\nclient” fashion—for example, that a physician can care for a person and kill them at the \nsame time (AVDCOPE:14), and that if this were a prison disciplinary proceeding, the \nplaintiff would have to show “atypical and significant hardship,” whereas being \nexecuted by a physician is neither atypical nor a hardship (AVDCOPE:15‐16).  Stating \nwhat one does not know (AVDCOPE:14) about medical ethics does not demonstrate \nthat one’s opponent is unlikely to succeed on the merits if one can’t kill the opponent \nbefore he gets a hearing. \n3.  Defendants attempt to recycle the same arguments they used, without \neffect, in their motion to dismiss to the effect that the use of an unnecessarily painful \nform of execution is not a badge of slavery. \nOnce more, the defendants attempt to use the pending “application” as an end \nrun around the district court’s denial of their motion to dismiss. \nIn this action, the plaintiffs do not claim that the death penalty is a badge of \nslavery—only that the use of a form of execution which causes unnecessary pain and \nsuffering is a badge of slavery.  Defendants to not question the historical evidence the \ndefendants submitted with their original and amended complaints, but argue that if a \npractice isn’t a carbon copy of chattel slavery, the plaintiffs have no likelihood of \nprevailing on the merits.  That is why we have hearings.  The only question is whether \nthis one will go on when the lead plaintiff is six feet under. \n \n\nB.  Defendants beg the question of irreparable harm to plaintiff Taylor by \nasserting the very propositions of fact and law on which they have lost in the \ndenial of their motion to dismiss and on which the district court has set a hearing \nfor February 21. \nDefendants cannot seriously contend that being put to death by a means society \ndoes not tolerate for euthanizing animals would be an “irreparable injury.”  Because \nthey cannot bring themselves to acknowledge any claim that would cast doubt on their \nactions, they attempt to meet this point in the Dataphase analysis by asserting that their \ncase is so strong on the merits that an execution by their chosen means couldn’t possibly \nwork an irreparable harm on anyone.  That would have been a good argument if the \ndistrict court had agreed with their motion to dismiss; it is another attempt at an end \nrun in light of the district court’s rejection of it. \nOur law is repelled by the notion of hanging in the morning and trying in the \nafternoon.  In light of the fact that the plaintiffs have prevailed on the motion to dismiss, \nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing an order that they may present \ntheir case before one of them is rendered unable to proceed with the case because the \nvery means he challenged in it have been used to kill him. \nC.  Defendants fail to establish that “the harm to other interested parties if \nthe relief is granted” rises to the level to make the district court’s decision an \nabuse of discretion. \nDefendants assert that the decedent’s family will suffer harm if plaintiff Taylor is \nexecuted on February 22 or March 1 rather than February 1.  (AVDCOPE:18 (talismanic \ninvocation of “closure”).)  Assuming the defendant’s suppressed and dubious premise \n \n\nthat the decedent’s want plaintiff Taylor executed at all, the defendants do not suggest \nthat the decedent’s family wants him executed in a manner that will create unnecessary \npain and suffering.  There is no difference in principle between allowing the district \ncourt the minimal amount of time it found that it needs to conduct a hearing on the \naction filed June 3, 2006, and forbidding the defendants to execute plaintiff Taylor in a \nway the district court had already found to be unconstitutional.  If denying condemned \npersons a day in court were an acceptable price for “closure,” then no constitutional \nrights of persons convicted of capital offenses (including those implicating their guilt of \nthe underlying offense) would be safe from the political branches. \nD.  Defendants’ vague allegations of “the effect on the public interest” of \nholding a hearing on their method of lethal injection before using in on a litigant \nwho filed his action months before they and their privies set an execution date \nless than a week after the district denied their motion to dismiss do not rise to the \nlevel to make the district court’s decision an abuse of discretion. \nDefendants attempt to inject the facts of the underlying offenses as if that \njustified their infliction of gratuitous pain and suffering on plaintiff Taylor.  \n(AVDCOPE:18 n.8.)  They would thereby have this Court sanction a reversal of \nthousands of years of progress in the criminal law.  Although the Supreme Court has \nallowed the states and the federal government to extract the “mere extinguishment of \nlife,” the presence of unsavory facts in the underlying case is no more a defense to using \nunnecessarily painful forms of execution than it would be to denying trials altogether \nbecause the condemned person did not give the decedent a fair trial. \n \n\nBoilerplate about the state’s interest in seeing that sentenced be carried out \nproves too much, in that this Court sees them even when there is absolutely no doubt \nthat an execution cannot go forward according to the executioners’ timetable.  In this \nprocedural context, the question is not whether there is absolutely no doubt, but only \nwhether the district court abused its discretion in granting the limited relief it granted. \nRecent months have seen a heightened awareness of the issue of torture.  In the \namended complaint, the plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of the district court in part on \nthe basis of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment, or Punishment—art. I, ¶ 1, of which defines “torture” as “any \nact by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted on a person for such purposes as . . . punishing him for an act he or a third \nperson has committed or is suspected of having committed . . . or for any reason based \non discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the \ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person \nacting in an official capacity.” (Attachment 1 at 15‐16.)  Because the defendants’ use of a \nform of lethal injection which causes the certainty (at least in respect to the central‐line \nprocedure) or known risk of unnecessary pain and suffering is an official act done for \nthe purpose of punishment, it falls within the definition of “torture” which is most \nrelevant to assessing the harm to the public interest of denying plaintiff Taylor a day in \ncourt on his constitutional claims. \nIn the district court, the plaintiffs pleaded that the public interest militates \nheavily in favor of an adjudication on the merits of this claim, rather than on letting the \ndefendants avoid it by torturing the plaintiff to death under a chemical veil.  Plaintiffs’ \n \n\naction is absolutely neutral about the death penalty, and if the country wants to keep it \nfor the time being, it is most likely to do so if the boil with the habitual three‐chemical \nsequence is lanced in this action.  At the same time, it is not in the public interest for the \ncitizens of all but two lethal‐injection jurisdictions to be implicated in torture when the \nostensible purpose of lethal injection is to bring about the “mere extinguishment of life.”  \nThe place of the United States in an increasingly interdependent world—in which its \nmere practice of the death penalty has pro tanto alienated it from all but a few mostly \nrepressive, backward countries including two which our fathers (including the district \njudge who entered the order here challenged) have fought seriatim throughout the \nPacific and then in Korea.  It is reasonable to anticipate that when the LANCET article \n(Lubarsky Exhibit 2 to Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2) has had the effect in Western Europe that it \nought to have here, the United States will be substantially impaired in its ability to \nobtain extradition of those charged with crimes against the United States.  That, and not \nrespecting the prerogative of the district court to hold a hearing before signing off on \nyet another execution, is the appropriate focus of the public interest inquiry. \n \n\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, respondent Taylor prays the Court for \nits order that the pending application to vacate stay of execution be denied. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON \n \nOf Counsel  2683 South Big Bend Blvd. # 12 \nSindel, Sindel & Noble, P.C.  Saint Louis, Missouri  63143‐2100 \n \n(314) 645‐1776 —  FAX (314) 645‐2125 \n  simonj@sbcglobal.net \n \nAttorney for Petitioner \n ",

)\nAPPLICATION TO VACATE STAY OF EXECUTION\nPetitioners counsel, apply to vacate the stay of execution entered by the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Michael Anthony\nTaylor v. Larry Crawford, Director of Missouri Dep’t of Corrections, and James D.\nPurkett, Supt. of the Eastern Reception Diagnostic and Correction Center, and John\nDoes 1‐666, No. 06‐1278WMJC (8th Cir. Jan. 29, 2006).\nProcedural History\nRespondent Taylor pled guilty to first degree murder, armed criminal\naction, kidnapping and forcible rape for which he was sentenced to death,\nfifty  years,  fifteen  years,  and  life  imprisonment,  all  sentences  to  run\n\nconsecutively.  The court affirmed the convictions and sentences as well as the\ndenial of post‐conviction relief.  State v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo. banc\n1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1152 (1997).  \nTaylor initiated a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The district court denied\nthe petition, and the court of appeals affirmed.  Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d\nth\n963 (8  Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 947 (2004).\nOn June 3, 2005, Taylor filed a suit asserting civil rights claims under 42\nU.S.C.  §  1983  that  his  execution  by  means  of  Missouri’s  lethal  injection\nprocedure would violate his constitutional rights.  On January 3, 2006, the\nSupreme Court of Missouri set an execution date of February 1, 2006, for\nTaylor.  On January 19, 2006, the district court entered its order in this case to\nbar Taylor’s execution on February 1 and directing that no execution take\nplace until the court holds a hearing on the merits beginning on February 21,\n2006, and further order of the court.\nOn January 29, 2006, the Eighth Circuit entered its order vacating the\norder of the district court, but issuing its own stay of execution through\n2\n\nFebruary 3, 2006, pending an immediate hearing and an order on the issues\nto be presented by the district court no later than 12 noon on Wednesday,\nFebruary 1, 2006.  Application Exhibit N.\nImpact of the Stay and Accompanying Procedural Mandate\nIn Missouri, execution warrants are issued by the Missouri Supreme\nCourt for a particular date. See, e.g., Missouri Supreme Court order of January\n3, 2006, and Warrant of Execution (Application Exhibits O and P).  See Delo v.\nStokes, 495U.S. 320,110 S. Ct. 1880, 1881 (1990).  They thus permit the execution\nto take place any time between 12:01a.m. and 11:59 p.m.  The Missouri\nDepartment of Corrections begins preparation for the execution days before\nthe warrant date.  Preparation accelerates during the day before the warrant\nday, with the object of being ready for the execution itself immediately after\nthe execution “day” begins – i.e., by 12:01 a.m. of the date fixed by the\nMissouri Supreme Court.  \nThere are, of course, myriad reasons that an execution might be delayed\n– though the most common by far are a stay entered by a court or an executive\ndelay resulting from pending judicial proceedings.  By setting the execution\n3\n\nfor 12:01am, the Department ensures that there is a full, 24‐hour day in which\nto resolve any such issues.  But if an issue is unresolved and the execution\ndoes not take place before midnight, the executive authority is erased.  The\nmatter returns to the Missouri Supreme Court for a new execution warrant.\nThe state must continue, and is continuing, to prepare for the execution\nscheduled at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, Wednesday, February 1, in anticipation of\nlegal challenges to the execution being determined against respondent Taylor.\nThe stay entered by the Eighth Circuit (or the one, now vacated, previously\nentered by the district court) will interfere with the completion of that process.\nDespite the accompanying mandate for a hearing and prompt ruling, the stay\nthreatens to force the entire process to begin again.  Although the Eighth\nCircuit order (Application Exhibit N) permits the state an opportunity to show\nagain (as it has already shown before in the Johnston case, discussed below)\nthat its lethal injection process does not violate the Constitution, it does not\ncall for a decision by the district court on this question until 12 noon on\nFebruary 1 – the middle of the execution  “day” as set by the Missouri\nSupreme Court.\n4\n\nPursuant to the Eighth Circuit order, the matter is proceeding apace.\nU.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan was appointed on Monday morning.  He\nheld three conference calls with counsel over the course of the day.  At the\nfirst he initiated work on scheduling.  At the second, learned what witnesses\nwould be available and when, and set a time to begin receiving testimony.\nDuring a lengthy third call, he received testimony from one witness for each\nside.  He set a fourth call for 9:30 this morning, Tuesday, January 31, to receive\nthe remaining testimony.  \nJudge Gaitan indicated from the outset that he intended to meet the\nEighth Circuit’s Wednesday noon deadline.  But by that moment, the day will\nalready be half gone – depriving the State and the appellate courts of 12 hours\nthat it would otherwise have to resolve any issues relating to the execution.\nWhat makes that situation particularly problematic is not the demand\nfor a hearing, nor the valiant efforts of Judge Gaitan to timely complete that\nassignment.  It is the presence of the stay in place until Friday, February 3\n(Application Exhibit N).  When Judge Gaitan rules, no matter how he rules,\n5\n\nthe process will not be over.  Even if he rules in the State’s favor – as we\nexpect him to do, for reasons further explained below – the State will be\nunable to act immediately.  The stay will still be in place; the Eighth Circuit\nwill have to act before the State can move.  And there is little doubt that\nsomeone will bring the matter before this Court.\nLitigation on the day before an execution has become, unfortunately,\ncommonplace.  But litigation on the day of an execution is a taboo that should\nnot be broken lightly, especially by a district court or a circuit court of appeals.\nIt is hard to imagine that such timing would not affect the ability of the State\nto meet the requirements of the February 1 warrant, while preserving security\nand order in the process, and adequately caring for victim’s family, public,\nand other witnesses.\nStandard of Review\nThis Court set forth the standard of review in this situation in Bowersox\nv. Williams, 517 U.S. 345 (1996).  \nA stay of execution pending disposition of the second or\nsuccessive federal habeas petition should be granted only when\nthere  are  ʺsubstantial  grounds  upon  which  relief  might  be\ngranted. . . . . Entry of a stay on a second or third habeas petition\n6\n\nis a drastic measure, and we have held that it is particularly\negregious to enter a stay absent substantial grounds for relief.  \nId. at 346 (citations and quotation marks omitted).  In light of this standard of\nreview, considering that this case is in a posture comparable to a successive\nfederal habeas action if not actually now such an action,1 this Court should\nvacate the lower courtʹs stay of execution.\nWhy The Stay Should Be Vacated\nRespondent Taylor makes three claims in this case, which he filed as a\n§ 1983 action.  He first challenges Missouri’s method of lethal injection as\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment’s ban of cruel and unusual punishments.\nPetitioners do not concede here that the action is properly one under § 1983.\n1\nTaylor  does  not  claim  an  individualized  harm  from  the  planned  means  of\nexecution.    Rather,  his  challenge  is  to  Missouri’s  method  of  execution  (as\nillustrated by Taylor’s former co-plaintiff Clay joining Taylor’s case and raising the\nidentical challenges to Missouri’s lethal injection process).  Even inN  elson v.\nCampbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2123 (2004), this Court did not hold that all\nmethod-of-execution claims could be pursued as ordinary civil litigation under\n§ 1983.  At the least, the order prohibiting respondent Taylor’s execution generally\n(instead of prohibiting only execution by means of the procedure under challenge)\ntransforms this action into a successive habeas.  See 541 U.S. at 647-48, 124 S. Ct. at 2125.\nFurther,  as  a  broad  bar  to  execution  by  any  means,  the  stay  order  is  also\ninconsistent with the injunctive relief this Court contemplated as proper in a\n“means of execution” suit under § 1983.   Id.  But that issue need not be resolved\ntoday as the Court has already granted review in Hill v. Crosby.  No. 05-8794\n(U.S. S.

a\nphysician violates medical ethics and thereby his “legitimate expectation that\na physician will not use his or her special skills and position of trust to kill\nrather than treat.”  Amended Complaint, ¶ 84 (Doc. No. 36).  \nRespondent Taylor cites the Code of Ethics of the American Medical\nAssociation to support his claim that physician involvement in the execution\nprocess is a breach of medical ethics.  Amended Complaint, ¶ 81.  But, it is not\nthe AMA Code of Ethics that governs the conduct of physicians in Missouri.\nSee Chapter 334, RSMo (§ 334.100 sets out ethical standards).  The petitioner\nprison officials have searched for, but been unable to find, any interpretation\nof medical ethics imposed upon physicians in Missouri that would prohibit\nthe physician from having a role in the execution process.  A California court,\nhowever,  has  examined  this  issue  with  regard  to  California  law  and\n20\n\ndetermined that physician involvement in executions does not constitute\nunprofessional conduct.  Thorburn v. Department of Corrections, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n584, 590‐91 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998).  \nRespondent Taylor here fails to establish a premise of his argument –\nphysician involvement in executions is a violation of ethics in Missouri.  In\nfact, such involvement is quite consistent with medical ethics.  Physician\ninvolvement shows the medical profession’s compassion for all, including\nthose sentenced to death.  By their involvement, physicians are promoting the\nbasic medical tenet of easing pain and suffering by doing what they can to\nmake executions as humane as possible.\nEven if physician involvement in Missouri executions were prohibited\nas unethical conduct, respondent Taylor still has not stated a claim.  The claim\nthat death sentenced inmates have a “legitimate expectation that a physician\nwill not use his or her special skills and position of trust to kill rather than\ntreat” is incongruous in the context in which it is raised here.  Logically, an\ninmate sentenced to death would have no legitimate expectation that anyone\n21\n\ninvolved  in  the  execution  would  direct  any  of  his  or  her  skills  toward\ndiminishing the likelihood of death.  \nFurther, as the court in Abdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 2004 WL 2246227, at\n*8 n.45 (Tenn. Ct. App., Oct. 6, 2004), aff’d, 2005 WL 2615801 (Tenn. Oct. 17,\n2005), stated:  \nWere [medical licensing] requirements applicable to executions by\nlethal injection, the Department’s ability to carry out its statutory\nmandates would be undermined because many licensed medical\nprofessionals would decline to participate in the procedure.  It\nwas for this reason that the Tennessee Supreme Court noted that\n“no public policy is violated by allowing physicians or anyone\nelse to participate in carrying out a lawful sentence.”  Coe v.\nSundquist,

19,\n2000).\n2004 WL 2246227, at *9.  Where public policy is not violated by a physician\nhaving a role in the execution process (even where such a role might be\ninconsistent with the ethical pronouncements of a professional regulating\nbody), it cannot be said, as respondent Taylor contends, that there is any\nlegitimate expectation that a physician will not have a role in executions.\nWithout such a legitimate expectation, Taylor has no due process right that is\n22\n\nconstitutionally protected.  See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr.\nComplex, 442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 2103‐04 (1979).\nFurther, at least in the prison disciplinary context, state created liberty\ninterests giving rise to due process rights are generally limited to those that\nimpose “atypical and significant hardship.”  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n484, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 2300 (1995).  Respondent Taylor’s claim here that he has\nsome sort of protected right that a physician not have a role in the execution\nprocess fails under the Sandin standard because the presence of a physician\nat his executions will not cause him any hardship at all, much less one that is\natypical and significant.  The presence of a physician may, on the contrary, be\na benefit to Taylor. \nTaylor fails to show how even a gross violation of medical ethics\nviolates any legitimate expectation of his that would support a due process\nclaim.  He has no likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.\nMissouri’s method of lethal execution does not violate the Thirteenth\nAmendment.  Respondent Taylor contends that Missouri’s method of lethal\ninjection constitutes a vestige and badge of slavery and therefore violates the\n23\n\nThirteenth  Amendment.    Amended  Complaint,  ¶  124.    The  Thirteenth\nAmendment provides: \nNeither  slavery  nor  involuntary  servitude,  except  as  a\npunishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\nconvicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject\nto their jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added.)  The Thirteenth Amendment does not apply here because\nthis case involves neither slavery nor involuntary servitude.  Even if it did, the\nAmendment specifically makes exception for instances in which a person is\nbeing  punished  for  a  crime.    Respondent  Taylor  here  falls  within  this\nexception.  See Wendt v. Lynaugh, 841 F.2d 619, 620 (5th Cir. 1988) (plaintiff\nwho has been convicted of a crime in no position to claim a right under the\nThirteenth  Amendment  because  exempted  by  precise  words  from  its\napplication ); Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1966) (“Thirteenth\nAmendment has no bearing on the legality of the imprisonment of persons\nduly convicted of a crime; such persons are explicitly excepted from the\nAmendment’s coverage”); Draper v. Rhay, 315 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cir. 1963)\n(“Thirteenth Amendment has no application where a person is held to answer\nfo a violation of a penal statute”).\n24\n\nMoreover,  a  difference  in  treatment  based  on  race  is  required  to\nestablish a claim under the Thirteenth Amendment of imposition of a “badge\nof slavery.”  See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 445, 88 S. Ct. 2186,\n2206 (1968).  Missouri’s method of execution is used on condemned prisoners\nof all races.  Therefore, it cannot be considered as a “badge of slavery.”\nRespondent Taylor also has no likelihood of success on this claim.\nEffect of Recent Capital Litigation\nThe recent grant of certiorari in Hill v. Crosby, No. 05‐8794 (U.S. S. Ct.,\nJan. 25, 2006), does not support Taylor’s argument here that his execution is\nproperly barred.  Although the Hill case does arise from claims regarding the\nconstitutionality of Florida’s method of lethal injection, the questions on\nwhich certiorari was granted are procedural only and have no bearing on the\nquestion here of whether respondent Taylor has established a sufficient basis\non which to support an order to prohibit his execution.  The questions\npresented in the petition for certiorari in Hill were:\n1. Whether a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by\na death‐sentenced state prisoner, who seeks to stay his execution\nin  order  to  pursue  a  challenge  to  the  chemicals  utilized  for\n25\n\ncarrying out the execution, is properly recharacterized as a habeas\ncorpus petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254?\n2.  Whether,  under  this  Court’s  decision  in  Nelson,  a\nchallenge to a particular protocol the State plans to use during the\nexecution process constitutes a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983?\nHill v. Crosby Petition for Certiorari, p. i.  These questions merely address the\nproper  procedural  vehicle  by  which  to  challenge  a  specific  method  of\nexecution.    The  lower  courts  in  Hill  addressed  only  the  question  of\njurisdiction, found it wanting, and never considered the means of execution.\nHill v. Crosby, No. 4:06‐CV‐032‐SPM (N.D. Fla., Jan. 21, 2006) (claim denied for\nlack of jurisdiction) (copy attached as Exhibit H); Hill v. Crosby, No.06‐10621\n(11th Cir., Jan. 24, 2006) (denying stay of execution due to district court’s lack\nof jurisdiction to hear case in first instance) (Application Exhibit I).  This\nCourt’s interest in Hill does not appear to arise from any question as to the\nmethod  of  execution,7  but  rather  from  an  intent  to  better  define  the\nEven if the Court’s interest were the method of execution, it should be\n7\nnoted that the method of execution in Florida provides for the administration\nof no less than 2 grams of sodium pentothal,  Hill v. State, 2006 WL 91302, at\nfootnote 3, while Missouri’s method of execution provides for the administration\nof 5 grams of that drug.  Exhibit D, at p. 12; Exhibit E, at ¶ 4B.\n26\n\ncircumstances in which method of execution claims may be pursued as claims\nunder § 1983, an issue expressly left open in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637,\n644, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2123 (2004).\nHere, petitioners and the lower courts have proceeded as if the Hill issue\nhad been decided in Taylor’s favor.  And with good reason:  The procedural\nquestion in Hill was ruled against Crawford and Purkett in the Johnston\nlitigation.  Johnston v. Crawford, 2005 WL 1474022, at *2 (W.D. Mo. 2005).\nThereafter the prison officials demonstrated at a hearing that the method was\nhumane.  Application Exhibits A and D.  Petitioners do not concede that the\nprocedural ruling in Johnston was correct.  But rather than delay proceeding\nby arguing against it, they have presented – and now in the expedited\nproceedings ordered by the Eighth Circuit, recreated – the Johnston record.\nThe conclusion in Johnston that Missouri’s execution process is lawful has not\nbeen legitimately challenged by respondent Taylor and is not called into\nquestion by the grant of review on the procedural question in Hill.  \nEven if Taylor is correct that this case properly remains a § 1983 action,\nthe order barring his execution was still an abuse of the court’s discretion.  It\n27\n\nis an abuse of discretion because the underlying claims here are meritless.\nWhichever form of action is proper, the stay of Taylor’s execution should be\nvacated and that execution allowed to proceed.\nThis view of Hill seems confirmed by this Court’s recent denial of\ncertiorari in Bieghler v. Indiana, No. 05‐8824 (Jan. 26, 2006).  Mr. Bieghler raised\na claim against the same three‐drug sequence used in executions as does\nrespondent Taylor in this case.  Indiana, like Missouri petitioners here, did not\nrest on a challenge Mr. Bieghler’s use of the § 1983 as a remedial vehicle\n(Application Exhibit K).  The district court declined to enjoin Mr. Bieghler’s\nexecution (Application Exhibit K).  The Seventh Circuit, voting 2‐1, ordered\na delay in the execution (Application Exhibit L), but this Court overturned\nthat order (Application Exhibit M) and the execution proceeded.\nGiven where it has led, respondent Taylor’s claim here should have\nbeen pursued in a habeas action.  But that is not an issue petitioners raise in\nseeking for vacation of the stay order, because even if this case is properly\npursued under § 1983, the order prohibiting Taylor’s execution still constitutes\nan  abuse  of  discretion.    Again,  as  shown  in  the  Johnston  proceedings,\n28\n\ndiscussed above, Missouri provides a humane method of execution that does\nnot inflict any gratuitous pain on the condemned.  The showing made by\npetitioners here goes beyond that shown in the Bieghler proceedings.\nThis  Court’s  vacation  of  the  stay  entered  in  Bieghler  seems  to\ndemonstrate that its grant of certiorari in Hill case was based on a view that\nthere was a need to resolve the question left open in Nelson v. Campbell, 541\nU.S. 637, 644, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2123 (2004), of when a method‐of‐execution\nclaim should be brought in a habeas or civil rights suit.  While that issue has\nbeen raised here, petitioners have also gone past that issue and established\nthat Missouri’s execution process does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment.  Resolution of the questions in Hill will not have any ultimate\nimpact on Taylor’s claims here.\nInterests of the Parties and the Public\nTo the extent that the Court considers an assessment of the interests of\nthe parties and the public appropriate here, the balance of those interests\nfavors vacation of the stay of execution.  The potential harm to respondent\nTaylor to be assessed is not whether his death will be the result of his\n29\n\nexecution, for he asserts that he is not challenging the fact of his death\nsentence.  He is challenging the means of his execution.  Thus, the harm to\nTaylor for the Court to consider here is the harm to him from execution by\nmeans  of  Missouri’s  three‐drug  process.    In  other  words,  will  Taylor’s\nexecution as planned cause him significant pain that is unnecessary?  See Reid,\n333 F. Supp. 2d at 551.  As shown above by the decision in Johnston v. Crawford\nand  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Dershwitz,  respondent  Taylor’s  execution  by\nMissouri’s three‐drug process is humane and will not result in any significant\ndiscomfort.\nThe harm to others and the public interest that results from an order\nbarring Taylor’s execution on February 1, 2006, is the harm to the family of the\nvictim and the harm to Missouri’s public policy that would result in an\ninterference with the imposition of the just punishment of Taylor.  The state\nof Missouri has determined that the death penalty is appropriate in certain\ncircumstances.  Those circumstances were found to exist in this case8 and\nRespondent Taylor and an accomplice kidnapped a 15-year old girl while she\n8\nwas waiting for a school bus, bound and blindfolded the girl, threatened her with\ndeath, raped her, put her in the trunk of their car, and then stabbed her repeatedly\nwith kitchen knives.  The girl probably lived for 30 minutes after she was stabbed.\n30\n\nrespondent Taylor was sentenced to death.  State v. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209\n(Mo. banc 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1152, 117 S. Ct. 1088 (1997).  He has now\npursued his post‐conviction remedies and his conviction and sentence of\ndeath have been approved.  States have “a significant interest in meting out\na sentence of death in a timely fashion.”  Nelson,541 U.S. at 644, 124 S. Ct. at\n2123.  See also Gomez, 503 U.S. at 654, 112 S. Ct. at 1653; In re Blodgett, 502 U.S.\n236, 239, 112 S. Ct. 674, 676 (1992).  Stopping Taylor’s execution now, based on\nunfounded assertions of inhumanity in Missouri’s execution process, would\ninterfere with the victim’s family’s ability to obtain closure and with the\nstate’s policy that crimes such as Taylor’s call for the ultimate punishment.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, petitioners pray that this court vacate the\ncourt of appealsʹ order granting a stay of execution in Taylor v. Crawford, No.\n06‐1278WMJC (8th Cir. Jan. 29, 2006) (Application Exhibit N).  By doing so, the\nCourt would not, of course, preclude the entry of a stay by the judge today\nhearing evidence pursuant to the expedited proceeding ordered by the Eighth\nState v.

Purkett, Superintendent,\nEastern Reception Diagnostic & Correctional Center, Appellees.\nNo. 06-1397.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.\nSubmitted: April 18, 2006.\nFiled: April 27, 2006.\n1096 *1096 Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., argued, Washington DC, for appellant.\nJames R. Layton, argued, Missouri Attorney General, Jefferson City, MO, for appellee.\nBefore RILEY, BEAM, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM.\nMichael Anthony Taylor appeals the district court's judgment denying his claim, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983, that the State of Missouri's current lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel\nand unusual punishment. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion but retain appellate\njurisdiction.\nI.\nMichael Taylor was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to first degree murder, armed criminal action,\nkidnapping, and forcible rape for the abduction, abuse and brutal murder of 15-year-old Ann Harrison. See State\nv. Taylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo.1996) (en banc), cert. denied,519 U.S. 1152, 117 S.Ct. 1088, 137 L.Ed.2d 222\n(1997). The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri denied his petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus, and we affirmed. See Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d 963 (8th Cir. 2003),cert. denied,541 U.S.\n947, 124 S.Ct. 1681, 158 L.Ed.2d 375 (2004). There is no question that Taylor's convictions and sentence of\ndeath are valid, and the State has a significant interest in the prompt execution of its judgments. See Nelson v.\nCampbell, 541 U.S. 637, 644, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004) (\"[A] State retains a significant interest in\nmeting out a sentence of death in a timely fashion\").\nNo death warrant had yet been issued on June 3, 2005, when Taylor filed the instant § 1983 action in the district\n1097 court challenging the method of his execution. *1097 Taylor sought a declaratory judgment that the State's\nexisting lethal injection procedure violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution by creating a substantial and unnecessary risk that Taylor will suffer the wanton infliction of\n[1]\ngratuitous pain.  Another Missouri death row inmate, Richard D. Clay, intervened in the lawsuit asserting the\nsame claim. The State's lethal injection protocol, which is not mandated by statute, involves administering (1) a 5-\ngram injection of sodium pentothal (also known as thiopental), (2) a 60-milligram injection of pancuronium\nbromide, and (3) a 240-milliequivalent injection of potassium chloride, with each injection separated by a saline\nflush. The injections are administered by an IV catheter that a board-certified surgeon has inserted into the\nfemoral vein. Taylor alleges that the State's three-chemical protocol creates a foreseeable likelihood that he might\nbe conscious but paralyzed and unable to indicate that he is suffering gratuitous and torturous pain before death,\nand that the placement and use of the femoral vein access causes the gratuitous infliction of pain.\nTaylor moved for expedited discovery on August 1, 2005. The court denied the motion but assured Taylor that he\nwould be given sufficient time for discovery and a decision prior to his execution. (See App. at A-52.) Discovery\n\nwent forward, but the State objected to certain interrogatories that sought the identity of the doctor and nurse who\nhad attended previous executions. Magistrate Judge Knox issued a protective order requiring the State to provide\nresponses concerning its practices and the qualifications of any medical personnel who have participated in\nexecutions, without disclosing their identities or any confidential information.\nThe State filed a motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim and alternatively argued that the case\nshould be recharacterized as a habeas petition and dismissed as second or successive. On December 28, 2005,\n[2]\nthe district court  denied the motion to dismiss. On January 3, 2006, the Supreme Court of Missouri set the date\nfor Taylor's execution as February 1, 2006, providing nearly a month within which the district court could and\nshould have held an evidentiary hearing in this case, resolved the issues and entered a judgment, and we could\nhave entertained any appeal.\nNot until January 18, 2006, did the district court set a date for an evidentiary hearing. The court set the hearing\nfor February 21, 2006, and ordered a temporary injunction staying the February 1 execution until further order of\nthe court after the hearing. Judge Wright gave no reason to justify the injunction other than that his calendar was\nunable to accommodate an evidentiary hearing prior to February 21. The State appealed the injunction on\nJanuary 23, 2006. We reversed the stay (see Order, No. 06-1278, Jan. 29, 2006) after concluding that the State's\nstrong interest in the prompt execution of its judgment was not outweighed by the district court's scheduling\n1098 difficulty. In recognition of Mr. Taylor's equally strong interest in having an evidentiary hearing *1098 on his claims\nprior to his execution, we ordered that the case be reassigned to a district court judge who could immediately\nhold an evidentiary hearing and issue a ruling prior to 12:00 noon on February 1. Our order also stayed the\nexecution until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, February 3, 2006, which provided a window of time for an appeal of the\nmerits to this court prior to execution.\nOn remand, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri reassigned the\ncase to the Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri,\nwho promptly held a telephonic evidentiary hearing on January 30 and 31, 2006. Judge Gaitan made it clear to\nthe parties that the hearing would be concluded within the time frame set by this court, and the intervenor\nwithdrew from the case. At the hearing, Taylor presented the expert opinion testimony of Dr. Mark J.S. Heath, an\nanesthesiologist, and Dr. Jonathan Groner, a pediatric surgeon. Taylor requested the State to produce John Doe\nNumbers One and Two (the doctor and nurse who participated in the most recent execution), but the district court\ndenied this request. The State presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Dershwitz, an anesthesiologist, and Terry\nMoore, the Director of the Adult Institutions Division of the Missouri Department of Corrections. At the close of the\nhearing, Taylor sought to present the expert testimony of Dr. Sri Melethil, a pharmacokineticist, to rebut the\nState's expert witness, but Dr. Melethil had been out of town and was unable to appear until the morning of\nFebruary 1. The district court did not permit this delay, and Taylor's attorney was unable to make an offer of proof\ndue to the scientific nature of the testimony and the limited time within which the district court was required to\nhold the hearing and make a decision. In good faith compliance with this court's order, Judge Gaitan heard and\nconsidered the testimony presented on January 30 and 31 and issued an order denying all claims on the\nafternoon of January 31.\nThe State then moved to vacate the stay of execution issued by this panel on January 29, 2006. In recognition\nthat the district court had completed the required hearing and entered an order denying Taylor's claims on the\nmerits, our panel modified the stay to provide that it would expire at 5 p.m. on February 1, 2006, rather than on\nFebruary 3, bringing it within the 24-hour window created by the Supreme Court of Missouri's death warrant.\nJudge Beam dissented on the ground that he would have vacated the stay in its entirety. (See Order, No.\n06-1278, Jan. 31, 2006).\nTaylor immediately appealed the district court's adverse order, asserting that the expedited and truncated hearing\nbefore the district court denied him of due process, that the district court abused its discretion by not permitting\nhim to call medical witnesses John Doe Numbers One and Two or Dr. Melethil, and that the district court erred in\ndenying his claims on the merits. Taylor also sought a stay of execution. The panel denied the stay. (See Order,\nNo. 06-1397, Feb. 1, 2006) (Hansen, J. dissenting). The same day, the en banc court voted (9-1) to grant Taylor's\npetition for rehearing and application for a stay. (See Order, No. 06-1397, Feb. 1, 2006) (en banc) (Riley, J.\n\ndissenting). The en banc court then returned the case to this panel for disposition following briefing and oral\nargument.\nII.\nHaving now thoroughly considered the arguments of the parties and having read the transcript of the record\n1099 developed before the district court in the telephonic hearing, we conclude that we will be somewhat *1099 more\ncomfortable as we consider and determine the merits of the case if the district court has had an opportunity to\nexpand or supplement the record. We mean no criticism of Judge Gaitan; in fact, we commend him for his\nexcellent management of the hearing and the issuance of an order on such short notice and within the extreme\ntime constraints created by the first district judge's failure to give the matter the expedited consideration it\nrequired and by our attempt to accommodate both sides within the remaining time established by the expiration\ndate of the state supreme court's death warrant. Having reviewed the record made before the district court, we\nnow realize the burdensome strain that our order imposed upon the district court as well as upon the parties as\nthey made extraordinary efforts to comply. We hereby offer our mea culpa 00 this panel attempted to\n97\naccommodate two significant and important competing interests, but unfortunately failed in both respects. As a\nresult, the enforcement of the State's judgment has been postponed, and Taylor was unable to make the record\nhe felt necessary for the full and fair consideration of the merits of his case. We simply asked the district court\nand the parties to do too much in too little time.\nSeveral existing circumstances inform our decision to remand. The United States Supreme Court is presently\nconsidering the issue of whether a § 1983 complaint brought by an inmate sentenced to death and challenging a\nstate's lethal injection procedure is properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition. See Hill v. Crosby, ___\nU.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1189, 163 L.Ed.2d 1144 (2006) (granting an application for a stay of execution and granting\nthe petition for a writ of certiorari on this issue). Because the Supreme Court did not grant a stay in the present\ncase (see ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1191, 163 L.Ed.2d 1145 (2006)), we will permit the case to continue in its\npresent form unless the Court's forthcoming decision in Hill at some point mandates a different course of action.\nAdditionally, the en banc court of this circuit granted a stay. In view of the existing record, the importance of the\nissue to this plaintiff as well as others, and the likelihood of the recurrence of these identical issues in future\nMissouri death penalty cases, we remand for the limited purpose of permitting a continuation of the hearing held\non January 30-31, 2006, before Judge Gaitan. While we conclude that some further opportunity for discovery\nmay be warranted, we leave all matters of what further discovery may be warranted to Judge Gaitan, confident\nthat if he feels it necessary he will employ the assistance of Magistrate Judge Knox, in light of Judge Knox's\nextensive prior experience with the pretrial issues in this case.\nIII.\nAccordingly, we remand the case with instructions that the hearing be reconvened before Judge Gaitan. The\nparties shall have 30 days from this order to engage in any further discovery that the district court in its discretion\ndeems warranted and an additional 30 days within which the hearing shall be completed and for the district court\nto enter its order amending, modifying, or restating its present judgment, and certifying the same to us. We will\nthen establish an expedited briefing schedule and an expedited oral argument. We choose this 60-day time\nperiod based on the representations of counsel made at oral argument that such a period is sufficient to complete\nthe task already begun, and we will strictly enforce it. We also choose it because we conclude such a period will\naccommodate the significant interests of both sides, which we have identified.\n1100 *1100 The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n[1] Taylor's complaint also included claims that the lethal injection protocol violates the Thirteenth Amendment as\na badge of slavery and that the State unlawfully uses physicians to carry out essential steps in an execution in\nviolation of medical ethics. At oral argument before this court, Taylor's attorneys explicitly abandoned those\n\nclaims. We therefore will not address them in this opinion, and they may not be reasserted before the district\ncourt on remand.\n[2] The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Purkett,  *\nSuperintendent, Eastern Reception *\nDiagnostic & Correctional Center, *\n*\nAppellees. *\n___________\nNo.  06-2914            ORDER\n___________\n       [PUBLISHED]\nMichael Anthony Taylor, *\n*\nAppellee, *\n*\nv. *\n*\nLarry Crawford, Director, MO Dept. *\nof Corrections; James D. Purkett, *\nSuperintendent, Eastern Reception *\nDiagnostic & Correctional Center, *\n*\nAppellants. *\n___________\n___________\n\nBefore RILEY, BEAM, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.\n___________\nTaylor's  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  claims  challenging  Missouri's  lethal  injection\nprotocol are before the court on his notice of interlocutory appeal from the district\ncourt's January 31, 2006, order refusing to enjoin the execution of his state-court\nimposed death sentence.  (Appeal number 06-1397).\nOn April 27, 2006, the court remanded the case to the district court for an\nadditional merits hearing on Taylor's claims.  Jurisdiction was retained.\nThe district court, after discovery and hearing, determined that Missouri's then\nexisting  protocol  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment,  enjoined  its  use  in  Taylor's\nexecution, stayed Taylor's death warrant, amended its earlier order to the contrary, and\non June 26, 2006, certified its findings and conclusions to this court.  The district court\nalso concluded \"that it [was] within its equitable powers to fashion a remedy\"\nestablishing an acceptable protocol for the use of lethal injunctions in the execution\nof death sentences imposed by Missouri courts, citing Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.\nSupp. 2d 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2006), and Brown v. Beck, No. 5:06-CT-3018-H (E.D.N.C.\nApril 7, 2006) (Doc. No. 32).  It then did so.\nAs directed, although after the certification, Crawford filed in the district court\na revised protocol for use in carrying out Taylor's death sentence.  On July 24, 2006,\nTaylor filed objections to the new protocol and on that same day, Crawford filed a\nnew notice of interlocutory appeal in response to the district court's June 26, 2006,\norder.  The next day, the district court, noting its earlier certification and the recently\nfiled notice of appeal, recognized a lack of jurisdiction.  With this, the district court\nforwarded the revised protocol to this court.  In the meantime, Taylor filed an\nunopposed motion to hold briefing in abeyance and his lawyer filed a motion for\nsubstitution of counsel and withdrawal.  We now address each of these matters.\n-2-\n\nThe district court was correct in noting that it retained no further jurisdiction in\nappeal number 06-1397 after its certification of findings and conclusions on June 26,\n2006.  And, though the matter was already before this court pursuant to Taylor's\nearlier notice of appeal, Crawford's new notice of appeal of July 24, 2006, although\ncontinuing to deal generally with Taylor's section 1983 claims, resulted in a new\nappeal.  (Appeal number 06-2914).\nWhile the court questions whether in the circumstances of this case the district\ncourt was \"within its equitable powers\" in directing Crawford to adopt a revised\nprotocol for lethal injections in Missouri, it finds that it is not necessary to decide that\nissue  now.    The  district  court  clearly  did  have  authority  to  determine  the\nconstitutionality of the then existing execution procedures originally presented, to set\nforth in detail its reasons for such holding, and to enter its June 26, 2006, order,\ndealing with such subjects.  The district court also had jurisdiction to grant Taylor the\nremedy of injunction or, in the alternative, to deny such relief, totally or conditionally.\nSee, e.g., Morales, 415 F. Supp. 2d at 1046-47.\nSince Crawford has now proposed the revised protocol for use in the execution\nof Taylor's death sentence, the court remands jurisdiction of this dispute to the district\ncourt for consideration of this newly propounded protocol and all other issues now\nframed by the parties' pleadings and notices of appeal.  In the course of or after such\nconsideration, any party is free to seek, or not, review of any appealable interlocutory\ndecision or final decision the district court renders or has rendered at any stage of this\ncontinuing litigation.\nThe previously imposed briefing schedules in appeal number 06-1397 are\nvacated and the pending motions for withdrawal and substitution of counsel are also\nremanded to the jurisdiction of the district court for consideration and decision.\n-3-\n\nThe appeals are remanded to the district court for further proceedings in\naccordance with this order.\nAugust 9, 2006\nOrder Entered at the Direction of the Court\nClerk, U.S. Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit     \n-4-",

Summary \nAs set forth in detail in the declarations of anesthesiology professors \nMark J.S. Heath, M.D. (Exhibit 1), and David A. Lubarsky, M.D. (Exhibit 2) \nwhich were filed with the original complaint, the use of a specific \nsuccession of chemicals in judicial executions by lethal injection—which the \ndefendants or their predecessors in office have admitted they use—creates \na foreseeable risk of the gratuitous infliction of pain and suffering, in that \nthe first of the three chemicals is used by health‐care professionals \nspecifically because it wears off when the patient experiences stimuli which \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\nproduce pain; the second chemical paralyzes the prisoner such that he \ncannot breathe and he suffers from suffocation, but the prisoner cannot cry \nout or even flinch, because of the paralysis; the third chemical burns as it \nworks its way through his veins to the heart, killing him with a heart \nattack—which to a conscious person is painful.  The co‐authors of a peer‐\nreviewed study published April 16, 2005, in the world‐renowned medical \njournal THE LANCET found that in 43% of the executions for which four \nstates provided information, the levels of anesthesia were inadequate to \nrender the prisoner unconscious at the time of his death; and those \nexecutions were in jurisdictions which (unlike Missouri) were careful \nenough to keep records and confident of the humanness of their several \npractices to share these data with the co‐authors.  None of the three \nchemicals are required by Missouri statute; neither any one of them nor the \ncombination of them is necessary to bring about the death of the plaintiffs.  \nDefendants could bring about the death of a prisoner by the administration \nof a single, lethal dose of a single anesthetic, pentobarbital, as their \nveterinarians would do if they had a pet which they decided to have \neuthanized.  Discovery in this case has to date disclosed that the \ndefendants use a board‐certified surgeon to prepare the chemicals for \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\ninjection into the prisoner’s body for the purpose of killing the prisoner, \nand that they also use the same board‐certified surgeon to catheterize the \nfemoral vein to achieve central vein access for the purpose not of healing \nbut of injecting the chemicals for the purpose of killing the prisoner.  The \nEighth Amendment forbids the gratuitous infliction of pain and suffering, \nand the Fourteenth Amendment applies this guaranty against the states.  \nThe Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery, of which not only the \ncontemporary infliction of the death penalty but more specifically the use \nof a form of execution more painful than necessary to bring about the death \nof the prisoner is a relic, a vestige, and a badge.  In addition, the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects individuals from governmental conduct which is \noppressive or shocks the conscience.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief they \nseek. \nII.

Plaintiff Taylor is a person within the jurisdiction of the State of \nMissouri. \n3.  Plaintiff Taylor was sentenced to death in the Circuit Court of \nJackson County (the Hon. Alvin G. Randall, Circuit Judge; on remand, the \nlate Hon. Michael Coburn) for the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a \nminor child, A.H., while acting together with Roderick Nunley. \n4.  Plaintiff Taylor is attacking the conviction and sentence of the \nCircuit Court of Jackson County by a pending certiorari petition, No. 05‐\n6135, seeking the review of the Supreme Court of the United States of the \ndenial of his motion to recall the mandate of the Missouri Supreme Court \nin its Docket No. 85235, but not in this complaint. \n‐ 9 ‐ \n\n5.  Plaintiff Taylor is also attacking the same conviction and \nsentence in a state habeas corpus petition now pending before the Missouri \nSupreme Court in its Docket No. 87054, but not in this complaint. \n6.  Plaintiff Richard D. Clay, CP 120, is a citizen of the United \nStates and a resident of the State of Missouri. \n7.  Mr. Clay is a person within the jurisdiction of the State of \nMissouri. \n8.  Mr. Clay was convicted upon his plea of not guilty of first \ndegree murder in Callaway County, Missouri, Case No. CR594‐4F and \nsentenced to death on September 12, 1995, for the murder of Randy \nMartindale.  He was tried before a jury. \n9.  Mr. Clay has no pending actions involving this conviction and \nsentence in any court. \n10.  Plaintiffs are incarcerated at the Potosi Correctional Center, \n11593 State Highway O, Mineral Point, Washington County, Missouri  \n63660. \n11.  The State of Missouri conducts its executions at the Eastern \nMissouri Reception, Diagnostic & Correctional Center, 2727 Highway K, \nBonne Terre, St. Francois County, Missouri 63628. \n‐ 10 ‐ \n\n12.  Defendant Larry Crawford is Director of the Department of \nCorrections of the State of Missouri. \n13.  Defendant Crawford is specifically authorized and directed by \nstate statute to prescribe and direct the means by which the Department of \nCorrections carries out executions within the statutorily specified methods \nof lethal gas or lethal injection.3  Plaintiffs do not in this complaint contend \nthat lethal injection is per se unconstitutional. \n14.  Defendant Crawford is sued in his individual and official \ncapacity for the purpose of obtaining prospective declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \n15.  At all times and in all respects referred to in this complaint, \ndefendant Crawford acted and will act under color of state law. \n16.  Defendant Crawford’s office is at 2729 Plaza Drive, Jefferson \nCity, Cole County, Missouri  65109. \n                                           \n3Mo. Rev. Stat. § 546.720:  “The manner of inflicting the punishment \nof death shall be by the administration of lethal gas or by means of the \nadministration of lethal injection.  And for such purpose the director of the \ndepartment of corrections is hereby authorized and directed to provide a \nsuitable and efficient room or place, enclosed from public view, within the \nwalls of a correctional facility of the department of corrections, and the \nnecessary appliances for carrying into execution the death penalty by \nmeans of the administration of lethal gas or by means of the administration \nof lethal injection.” \n‐ 11 ‐ \n\n17.  Defendant Crawford is a resident of the Central Division of the \nWestern Federal Judicial District of Missouri. \n18.  Defendant James D. Purkett is Superintendent of the Eastern \nReception, Diagnostic & Correctional Center (ERDCC), in Bonne Terre, St. \nFrancois County, Missouri. \n19.  Defendant Purkett is “warden” or chief executive officer of \nERDCC, and is therefore charged with the management of ERDCC. \n20.  Defendant Purkett’s principal place of business is the Eastern \nReception, Diagnostic & Correctional Center (ERDCC), 2727 Highway K, \nBonne Terre, St. Francois County, Missouri 63628. \n21.  Defendant Purkett is a resident of the Eastern District of \nMissouri. \n22.  ERDCC is where the State of Missouri began conducting its \nexecutions on April 27, 2005. \n23.  By virtue of his authority over the staff of ERDCC, defendant \nPurkett is responsible for the way in which executions are conducted in \nMissouri. \n24.  Defendant Purkett is sued in his individual and official capacity \nfor the purpose of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief. \n‐ 12 ‐ \n\n25.  At all times and in all respects referred to in this complaint, \ndefendant Purkett acted and will act under color of law. \n26.  Defendants John Does 1‐666 are officials, officers, employees, \nagents, and servants of the State of Missouri who, by virtue of their \nemployment or other status (including independent contractors and \nvolunteers under the supervision of the defendants and their designees), \nparticipate in the planning of, purchasing and preparation for, carrying out \nof, and covering up of details about executions in the State of Missouri. \n27.  Plaintiffs cannot provide the Court the natural names of these \nindividuals because the State of Missouri and its officials, officers, and \nemployees have thus far kept them secret. \n28.  John Does 1‐666 are sued in their individual and official \ncapacities for the purpose of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief. \n29.  Defendants Does 1‐666 reside in the Eastern and Western \nDistricts of Missouri. \n30.  At all times and in all respects referred to in this complaint, \ndefendants Does 1‐666 acted and will act under color of law. \n31.  Each and all of the foregoing defendants Crawford, Purkett, \nand Does 1‐666 at all times relevant to this complaint were acting in their \n‐ 13 ‐ \n\nofficial capacities with respect to all acts and omissions described in this \ncomplaint, and were in each instance acting under color of state law. \n32.  Unless permanently enjoined against doing so, the defendants \nand each of them intend to act in their respective official capacities and \nunder color of state law to execute the plaintiffs by lethal injection in the \nmanner set forth in this complaint. \nIV.  Jurisdiction \n33.  Plaintiffs bring this action to enforce and protect their rights \nunder the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied \nagainst the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, and also to enforce and \nprotect their rights under the Thirteenth Amendment. \n34.  This Court has jurisdiction over this cause under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331, in that it arises under the Constitution of the United States; under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), in that it is brought to redress deprivations, under color \nof state law, of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the United \nStates Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), in that it seeks to secure \nequitable relief under an Act of Congress, i.e., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which \nprovides a cause of action for the protection of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States; \n‐ 14 ‐ \n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), in that one purpose of his action is to secure \ndeclaratory relief; and under 28 U.S.C. § 2202, in that one purpose of his \naction is to secure permanent injunctive relief. \n35. In addition to the foregoing, this Court has jurisdiction by virtue \nof the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \nInhuman or Degrading Treatment, or Punishment. \n36. Article 1, ¶ 1 of the Convention defines “torture” as “any act by \nwhich severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third \nperson information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third \nperson has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating \nor coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on \ndiscrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at \nthe instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or \nother person acting in an official capacity.”  (Emphasis supplied.) \n37. Article 2, ¶ 1, provides that “Each State Party shall take effective \nlegislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of \ntorture in any territory under its jurisdiction.” \n‐ 15 ‐ \n\n38. Article 1, ¶ 1 adds that torture “does not include pain or suffering \narising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.”  Because \nthe plaintiffs invoke the treaty as providing a remedial structure rather \nthan as a source of substantive law, it would be begging the question or \nbeside the point for the defendants to argue that the pain from their \nspecific method of lethal injection is part of a “lawful” sanction.  The Eighth \nAmendment controls on the question whether such an execution is lawful. \n39. Consequently, because this Court’s jurisdiction does not depend \non a federal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e would not bar relief even if the \nselection of a garrote rather than lethal injection were a “prison condition.” \nV.  Venue \n40.  Venue is proper in this federal judicial district under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b)(1)‐(3) in that (1) defendant Crawford resides in its territorial \njurisdiction; (2) defendant Crawford’s decisions regarding the specific \nmeans of using lethal injection are made in its territorial jurisdiction, and \n(3) defendant Crawford may be found in its territorial jurisdiction. \nVI.  Facts \n41.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege the contents of each preceding \nparagraph as if fully set forth again. \n‐ 16 ‐ \n\nFacts Specifically Bearing on Count I \n42.  Defendants intend to execute the plaintiffs by lethal injection \nusing a succession of three chemicals:  sodium pentothal, pancuronium \nbromide, and potassium chloride. \n43.  As set forth in greater detail in the declarations of \nanesthesiologists, Mark J.S. Heath, M.D. (Exhibit 1), and David A. \nLubarsky, M.D. (Exhibit 2), the use of this succession of chemicals in \njudicial executions by lethal injection creates a foreseeable risk of the \ngratuitous infliction of pain and suffering.  The use of this succession of \nchemicals, or of any one or more of them, is absolutely unnecessary to \nbring about the death of the plaintiffs.  (E.g., Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 25, 36, 41 & 45.) \n44.  Specifically, sodium pentothal, also known as thiopental, is a \nultra‐short acting substance which produces shallow anesthesia.  Health‐\ncare professionals use it as an initial anesthetic in preparation for surgery \nwhile they set up a breathing tube in the patient and use different drugs to \nbring to patient to a “surgical plane” of anesthesia that will last through \nthe operation and will block the stimuli of surgery which would otherwise \ncause pain.  Sodium pentothal is intended to be defeasible by stimuli \nassociated with errors in setting up the breathing tube and initiating the \n‐ 17 ‐ \n\nlong‐run, deep anesthesia; the patient is supposed to be able to wake up \nand signal the staff that something is wrong.  (Exhibit 1 ¶¶ 20‐22.) \n45.  Sodium pentothal is unstable in liquid form.  To be effective as \nan anesthetic, it must be mixed up and administered by a person with the \nqualifications of a licensed health‐care professional.  Licensed health‐care \nprofessionals cannot by law and professional ethics participate in \nexecutions.  (Exhibit 1, ¶ 26.) \n46.  The sodium penthothal which the defendants administer to \ncondemned persons in Missouri either has not been prepared and \nadministered by one who is qualified under Missouri law to do so in the \ntherapeutic environment or has not been prepared and administered by a \nhealth‐care professional who respects the ethical norms of his or her \nprofession and perceives the loss of his or her license as an incentive to \nconfirm his or her conduct to its standards.  This fact increases the risk—if \nnot guarantees the result—that the sodium pentothal will not have the \nintended anesthetic effect on the condemned person. \n47.  The second chemical the defendants use in lethal injections is \npancuronium bromide, sometimes referred to simply as pancuronium.  It is \nnot an anesthetic.  It is a paralytic agent, which prevents any of the \n‐ 18 ‐ \n\nvoluntary muscles of the body from moving, including those which control \nbreathing, and effectively stops the lungs from functioning.  It has two \ncontradictory effects:  first, it causes the person to whom it is applied to \nsuffer suffocation when the lungs stop moving; second, it prevents the \nperson from manifesting this suffering, or any other sensation, by facial \nexpression, hand movement, or speech.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 27‐30.) \n48.  When sodium pentothal is exposed to pancuronium bromide, it \nprecipitates, i.e., returns to the solid condition it was in before the \nexecutioner of unknown qualifications or lack thereof mixed it up in \npreparation for the execution.  Once it returns to its solid condition, the \nsodium pentothal is no longer active as an anesthetic.  Any one of a \nnumber of mistakes—the type of mistakes that one would expect to occur \nwhen sodium pentothal is prepared and administered by a non‐licensed \nperson or one who scoffs at the norms of his or her profession and is given \nlicense to do so by the defendants’ protection of his or her anonymity—or \nsimply bad luck, can cause this abatement of the anesthetic effect toward \nthe beginning of the lethal injection.  In the absence of the assurance that \nthe executioners have the same skills as anesthesiologists, nurse‐\nanesthetists, or even veterinarians or their staff, the likelihood is substantial \n‐ 19 ‐ \n\nthat this will happens in any given execution by lethal injection performed \nin the State of Missouri. \n49.  Pancuronium bromide is unnecessary to bring about the death \nof a person being executed by lethal injection.  It has the unconscionable \neffect of creating the possibility that the sodium pentothal will become \nineffective when the prisoner begins to suffer suffocation from the \npancuronium bromide.  Its only relevant function is to prevent the media \nand the conscientious staff from knowing when the sodium pentothal has \nworn off and the prisoner is suffering from suffocation or from the \nadministration of the third chemical.  (Exhibit 1, ¶ 41.) \n50.  That third chemical is potassium chloride, which is the \nsubstance that causes the death of the prisoner.  It burns intensely as it goes \nthrough the veins toward the heart.  Because the veins are running back to \nthe heart after the arteries have carried it to the extremities, the blood runs \nmore slowly than it does in the arteries.  This prolongs the pain the \nprisoner suffers when the sodium pentothal wears off, as it is selected by \nsurgical anesthetists because it does.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 43‐44.) \n51.  When the potassium chloride reaches the heart, it causes a heart \nattack.  If the sodium pentothal has worn off by the time the potassium \n‐ 20 ‐ \n\nchloride reaches the heart (as it foreseeably would, given the shallow \nnature of the anesthesia sodium pentothal is supposed to produce, from the \npotassium chloride burning its way through the veins), the prisoner feels \nthe pain of a heart attack, but no one but the prisoner can tell, because the \npancuronium bromide has paralyzed his face, his arms, and his entire body \nso that he cannot express himself either verbally or otherwise.  (Exhibit 1, \n¶¶ 43‐46.) \n52.  Veterinarians would not use any of these three chemicals in \neuthanizing animals, because the veterinary profession knows that the first \nis short‐acting and that the second and third are cruel means of bringing \nabout the death of a sentient being; for these reasons it would be illegal to \nuse either of the latter two chemicals in euthanizing a pet.  (Exhibit 1, \n¶¶ 25, 37‐40 & 47‐50.)  They cause pain and suffering far in excess of what \nis necessary to bring about the mere extinguishment of life. \n53.  Veterinarians are forbidden to use these chemicals even though \nthey may personally participate in euthanasia and may also recruit and \nretain the most qualified available personnel to assist them.  By contrast, \nphysicians are forbidden by the Hippocratic Oath and by positive law from \nparticipating in executions.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 55‐58.) \n‐ 21 ‐ \n\n54.  A veterinarian would use a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a long‐\nacting anesthetic, to perform euthanasia consistently with professional \nregulations, positive law, and the values of humaneness which the latter \nnorms reflect.  This substance is an alternative to the three‐chemical \nformula the defendants use on other people.  Although neither plaintiff is \nadvocating his own death, they point out pentobarbital as a specific \nalternative to the three‐chemical sequence, with the amount, concentration, \nand timing, and the qualifications of staff performing and monitoring the \nexecution, to be determined in the course of discovery. \n55.  On April 16, 2005—the day after the Missouri Supreme Court \nset the execution date in the Vernon Brown case—Dr. David A. Lubarsky \nand three co‐authors published in the world‐renowned medical journal \nTHE LANCET the results of their research on the effects of these chemicals in \nlethal injections in the few states which bothered to conduct autopsies and \nprepare toxicology reports, and which did not refuse to produce these data \nfor these scholars. \n56.  This publication is Exhibit 2 to Exhibit 2, the declaration of Dr. \nLubarsky. \n‐ 22 ‐ \n\n57.  The LANCET team found that in 43% of the lethal injections they \nstudied, the prisoner had an inadequate amount of sodium pentothal in his \nbloodstream to provide anesthesia.  (Exhibit 2, ¶ 16.)  In other words, in \nclose to half of the cases, the prisoner felt the suffering of suffocation from \npancuronium bromide, and the burning through the veins followed by the \nheart attack caused by the potassium chloride. \n58.  In their answers to Plaintiffs’ interrogatories, the defendants \nhave admitted that these three chemicals are used in Missouri executions.  \nDefendants have refused to disclose the training or lack thereof which the \nactual executioners have had.  Only blind faith would lead this Court to \nfind that the personnel they have been able to recruit to participate in this \nactivity have the skills of licensed medical and veterinary professionals \nwhich would be necessary to administer the chemicals in a minimally \ncompetent manner.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 55‐58; Exhibit 2, ¶¶ 19.f & 21.) \n59.  Although a Missouri statute specifies that death sentences will \nbe carried out by lethal gas or lethal injection, it does not prescribe any \ngiven chemical to be used in either process, but leaves these decisions up to \ndefendant Crawford.4 \n                                           \n4Mo. Rev. Stat. § 546.720. \n‐ 23 ‐ \n\n60.  Although the defendants have provided partial responses to \ndiscovery indicating that they use a larger initial injection of sodium \npentothal than the typical lethal‐injection jurisdiction uses, they have failed \nto meet the problem of neutralization through precipitation by their \nsubsequent use of pancuronium bromide, and they have failed to address \nthe original complaint’s quality‐assurance concerns in that they have \nrefused to identify the participants with sufficient particularity that counsel \ncan assess their actual qualifications.  All we know is that the physician and \nthe nurse who participate in these executions are outlaws within their \nrespective professions. \nFacts Specifically Bearing on Count II \n61.  In an attempt to meet the foregoing analysis as presented by the \nplaintiffs in Johnston v. Kempker, No. 4:04‐CV‐1975‐DJS (E.D. Mo.) and in \nthis case, the defendants have averred, in pleadings in the Johnston case and \nin partial response to the first set of interrogatories in this case, that their \nspecific method of lethal injection is not subject to the critiques of Drs. \nHeath and Lubarsky because they use a large initial dose of sodium \npentothal delivered through a central line catheter.  See Defendant \nCrawford’s Answers to Plaintiffs’ First Interrogatories (which are \n‐ 24 ‐ \n\nsubmitted with this amended complaint and marked “Exhibit 19), at 8‐9.  \nIn making these averments, the defendants, while trying to jump out of the \nfrying pan, have landed in the fire. \n62.  Dr. Jonathan I. Groner, Clinical Associate Professor of Surgery \nat Ohio State University College of Medicine & Public Health, will testify to \nall or substantially all of the averments of fact in support of this count.  \n(Curriculum vitae submitted as “Exhibit 20.”) \n63.  The procedure the defendants rely on for extra‐efficient access \nto the condemned man’s bloodstream is unnecessarily invasive, painful, \nand time‐consuming, and hence creates the certainty of gratuitous pain and \nsuffering beyond the “mere extinguishment of life.” \n64.  The femoral vein lies in close proximity to the femoral artery \nand femoral nerve.  The technique for inserting the catheter involves \ninserting a large needle directed to an anatomic landmark in order to \npuncture the vein.  Once the vein is punctured, a wire is passed into the \nvein, then a scalpel is used to make a small incision where the guidewire \nenters the skin, then the catheter is passed over the guidewire and into the \nvein.  Because the catheter has three separate channels, it is quite a bit \nlarger than a standard peripheral IV.  It is also usually 15 cm. longer.  In \n‐ 25 ‐ \n\nethical medical practice, local anesthesia is normally used in the skin at the \npuncture site.  Puncture of the artery is exceptionally painful because a \nlarge hematoma often will develop after the needle is removed and \nredirected toward the vein.  Puncture of the femoral nerve is excruciatingly \npainful.  The same holds true if the needle passes through the vein and \nstrikes the bones in the pelvis which lie below the vein. \n65.  Doctors who are qualified in the placement of central lines are \nin general surgeons, critical care specialists, interventional cardiologists, \ninterventional radiologists, and some emergency medicine physicians.  \nMost doctors in standard office practice, and probably many surgeons, \nwould not know who to do this procedure because the procedure is usually \nperformed by specialists. \n66.  Complications of femoral venous central lines include (a) \nsevere pain; (b) hemorrhaging and/or hematoma at the catheter site; (c) \nunrecognized arterial catheter placement, which would make the lethal \ninjection process exceedingly painful (because the drugs would flow down \nthe leg instead of into the heart and brain); (d) catheter tip malposition, in \nwhich case the catheter tip lies outside the vein, causing the lethal injection \ndrugs to be absorbed slowly, which would produce a slow, tortuous death; \n‐ 26 ‐ \n\n(e) air embolism, which when the catheter allows introduction of air into \nthe vein causing sudden death from air embolism; (f) hemorrhage into the \nabdomen; and (g) femoral arterial occlusion, which causes severe leg pain \ndue lo the absence of blood flow to the affected leg; and (h) perforation of \nthe heart by the metal guidewire used in the catheter insertion procedure.  \nAll of the foregoing negative consequences of this procedure are known \nrisks associated with it assuming it is performed by medical professionals \nwith the baseline credentials required to do it rather than hypotheticals \noutside the scope of clinical experience. \n67.  Insertion of the standard peripheral IV is the preferred \nprocedure for access to a vein unless (a) the patient has absolutely no \nvisible veins; (b) the patient is in shock and the peripheral veins are \ncollapsed or inaccessible; or (c) the patient needs venous pressure \nmonitoring during an operation. \n68.  Femoral line insertions are dangerous and, at best, \nuncomfortable procedures which are performed in awake, unsedated \npatients only in dire situations and in a rare case where there are absolutely \nno veins for the standard peripheral IV.  A femoral line is just one type of \ncentral line.  Others include subclavian and internal jugular lines. \n‐ 27 ‐ \n\n69.  It is standard medical procedure to obtain a radiograph (x‐ray) \nafter catheter insertion to confirm that the catheter is in the appropriate \nposition.  Failure to do so can result in catheter malfunction. \n70.  Use of a femoral central line therefore creates a substantial risk \nof inflicting severe and unnecessary pain and suffering during the lethal \ninjection process. \n71.  Defendant Crawford’s partial responses to the first set of \ninterrogatories also say that the state uses a “triple lumen central venous \ncatheter.”  (Exhibit 19 at 7, 9, 17 & 20.) \n72.  Triple lumen central venous catheters are highly sophisticated \nmedical devices.  They should only be inserted by practitioners who have a \nstrong understanding; of the anatomy of arteries, veins, and their \nappropriate landmarks.  Furthermore, the practitioner must be able to \nrecognize and initiate treatment of life and limb‐threatening complications \nincluding puncture of the heart, arterial puncture, nerve damage, \nhematoma, and air embolism.  Insertion of these catheters is associated \nwith a known, foreseeable likelihood of extreme pain, even assuming the \nprocedure is performed by medical professionals with the baseline \ncredentials required to do it.  Ethical physicians do not use triple lumen \n‐ 28 ‐ \n\nfemoral catheters are not used for administration of intravenous anesthetic \nagents when peripheral IV sites are available. \n73.  Whereas the kit one uses for a peripheral IV contains three \npieces, the kit surgeons use when they perform a central line procedure \nconsists of about 15‐20 pieces, including a “dilator” that goes over the \nguidewire to stretch out the tissues and thereby clear a path through the \npersonʹs body for the actual catheter.  The dilator looks like a small \nharpoon. \n74.  This procedure is not medically indicated and essentially \namounts to an unnecessary surgery performed on the prisoner without his \nconsent. \n75.  This procedure involves the use of a surgeon, implicating the \nmedical profession in executions in violation of medical norms from the \nHippocratic Oath to the present. \n76.  Like the use of pancuronium bromide, the foregoing procedure \nis performed not because it is necessary to bring about the “mere \nextinguishment of life” but as part of the defendants’ esthetic‐political \nagenda for prolonging the death penalty after the remainder of the \ncountries with which the United States enjoys being compared have \n‐ 29 ‐ \n\nabolished it, by putting a veneer medical practice and technology on the \nopposite of medicine—the deliberate killing of a defenseless human being. \nFacts Specifically Bearing on Count III \n77.  According to the expert on the other side of the litigation \ninvolving lethal injections, Mark Dershwitz, M.D., PH.D.—in testimony \nwhich the defendants’ counsel adduced in open court at the evidentiary \nhearing in the Johnston case—and according to defendant Crawford’s \npartial responses to the first set of interrogatories in this case, the \ndefendants use a “board certified surgeon” to mix the chemicals intended \nto kill the condemned man, to perform the procedure to achieve central line \naccess through the femoral vein, to monitor the condemned man’s heart \nactivity as reflected on their EKG, and to prescribe more “deadly drugs” if \nthe first batch does not do the trick.  (Exhibit 21 at 25 (board certified \nsurgeon), 26 (mixing chemicals) & 27‐33; Exhibit 19 at 32‐33.) \n78.  The State of Missouri undertakes to regulate the practice of \nmedicine.  See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 334.010, .020, .040 & .100. \n79.  This regulation has the purpose “to safeguard the public health \nand welfare”5 of Missouri residents (such as the plaintiffs in this action) \n                                           \n5Boyd v. State Board of Registration for Healing Arts, 916 S.W.2d 311, 317 \n‐ 30 ‐ \n\nfrom physicians’ misuse of their special knowledge and their time‐honored \nposition of trust. \n80.  The state’s structure for the regulation of physicians \nincorporates medical ethics.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 334.100 authorizes the Board \nof Registration for the Healing Arts to discipline a physician (by revoking \ntheir license or other sanctions) for “unethical conduct or unprofessional \nconduct.”6  Although the statute provides examples of such conduct, the \nBoard’s authority to discipline is not limited to these examples.7 \n81.  Medical ethics forbids physician participation in executions.  \nThe Hippocratic Oath of about 400 B.C. specifically binds the physician not \nto give any deadly drug:  “I will not give a drug that is deadly to anyone if \nasked . . . nor will I suggest the way to such a counsel.”8  The AMA Code of \nMedical Ethics E‐2.06 allows physicians to prescribe palliative medications \n                                                                                                                                        \n(Mo. Ct. App. E.D. 1995). \n \n6Mo. Rev. Stat. § 334.100.2(4). \n7E.g., Hughes v. State Board of Health, 348 Mo. 1236, 159 S.W.2d 277, 278 \n(1942), citing State ex rel. Lentine v. State Board of Health, 334 Mo. 220, 65 \nS.W.2d 943, 950 (1933). \n8Translation by Heinrich Von Staden in “In a pure and holy way:”  Personal and \nProfessional Conduct in the Hippocratic Oath, JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE AND \nALLIED SCIENCES 406-408 (1996), available Sept. 11, 2005, at \nhttp://www.indiana.edu/~ancmed/oath.htm (downloaded Sept. 11, 2005, and available in PDF \nfrom John William Simon). \n‐ 31 ‐ \n\nfor a prisoner who is suffering distress in advance of an execution and to \ncertify that an executed prisoner is dead after another person has \npronounced him dead, but expressly forbids several of the acts which the \n“board certified surgeon” whom the defendants use to carry out their \nexecutions performs.  See Exhibit 22.9 \n82.

Defendants’ action in using a physician to perform acts which \nviolate medical ethics is deliberate. \n87.  Defendants are arbitrarily withholding the protection of the \nstate’s regulatory structure by employing or allowing a physician to \nperform a state function in violation of medical ethics, and by withholding \n‐ 33 ‐ \n\nhis or her name to keep the state’s medical regulators from disciplining this \nphysician (assuming he or she is licensed in Missouri).10 \n88.  Employing—or accepting the volunteer/vigilante services of—a \nphysician to perform acts forbidden by medical ethics, and concealing the \nname of that physician, increases the risk that he or she will not conform to \nthe technical standards of medical practice when he or she has shown his \nor her contempt for the substantive standards of the profession, and when \nthe state has rendered him or her immune from professional discipline \nbecause of his or her willingness to violate professional norms when he or \nshe sees fit in order to kill. \n89.

Its central finding is that in the customs and practices of the State \nof Missouri, there is a strong historical association between the presence of \nblack slavery, the incidence of lynching, and a disproportionate number of \ndeath sentences after Furman v. Georgia11 and Gregg v. Georgia.12  It bears not \nonly on the absence of a lawful capital punishment régime—which is \n                                           \n11408 U.S. 238 (1972). \n12428 U.S. 153 (1976). \n‐ 35 ‐ \n\nbeyond the scope of this action—but also on the defendants’ selection of \nlethal‐injection chemicals and procedures that have an elevated likelihood \nof inflicting gratuitous pain, when they could use at least one \n(pentobarbital) which would—as they advertise their current practice, in \ncontradiction to veterinary law and practice—be like putting a dog to sleep. \n94. In the research for his dissertation, Dr. Lenza discovered that there \nis a strong historical association in fact within Missouri between counties \nthat had the heaviest levels of black slavery until the Civil War, the \nincidence of lynching, and an elevated rate of death sentences after Furman \nv. Georgia and Gregg v. Georgia.  (Exhibit 10.)  In the judicial circuits falling \ninto the slave and Southern cultural regions as Dr. Lenza defines them, a \nhomicide case is 286% more likely to be prosecuted as a capital case and \ntaken to trial as such than in the circuits he categories as urban.  (Exhibit 11 \nat 232.)  Such a case was 71% more likely to result in a death sentence.  (Id. \nat 233.)  Whether a case arose in the slave and Southern cultural regions \nwas the most important variable in predicting death sentences even when \ncompared such other reliable predictors to the color of the accused versus \nthe color of the decedent, whether the accused was a stranger to the \ndecedent, whether the homicide was performed with a knife (producing \n‐ 36 ‐ \n\nbetter gruesome photographs to inflame the jury), and whether the accused \nhad prior convictions and was represented by a public defender (both of \nwhich are surrogates for lower socio‐economic status of the accused).  (Id. \nat 233‐35.)  These data are not samples, but the universe of cases; there is a \n92% certainty that the associations Dr. Lenza found did not happen by \nchance fluctuation in the data.  (Id. at 235.) \n95. Just as 89% of executions occur in states which used to have \nslavery (Exhibit 11 at 3‐5), the practice of the death penalty in Missouri \ntoday is a reflection of the attitudes towards one’s fellow human beings \nwhich allowed slavery to exist and thrive until put down by force of arms. \n96. An underlying explanatory principle is that slavery “vested white \ncitizens with the power of the State to utilize extra‐legal violence to \nmaintain the social order,” i.e., the supremacy of whites over African‐\nAmericans.  (Exhibit 11 at viii.)  Like all Ph.D. theses, this one finds that \nmore research is called for, but also suggests that the results are consistent \nwith the proposition that the death penalty is “an institutionalized social \nartifact of slavery, maintaining the racialized social order through violence, \ncarried forth into our present by our social institutions.”  (Exhibit 11 at 244.) \n‐ 37 ‐ \n\n97. One of the subsidiary themes of Dr. Lenza’s dissertation is that \ngreater pain was imposed on slaves and their descendents who were \nexecuted—officially or unofficially—than on members of the master race \nwho were executed:  this frequently took the form of burning alive (Exhibit \n11 at 7, 63, 82, 108, 160‐62 & 174‐76), for which potassium chloride is as \nclose as the defendants can get away with in the court of public opinion.  \nSee Exhibit 10, ¶¶ 8‐11. \n98. Plaintiffs do not here contend that the death penalty in Missouri is \nunlawful because despite the color‐neutral statutes, it discriminates against \nmen of color and on other arbitrary or independently unlawful bases.  \nPlaintiffd d, however, plead—as in an intermediate premise in their claim \nfor relief under the Thirteenth Amendment—that the death penalty in \nMissouri falls disproportionately on African‐American residents.  Plaintiffs \nplead this premise in the course of establishing that the specific method of \nlethal injection the defendants have chosen is a badge of slavery. \n99. In support of the intermediate premise regarding disparate impact \nof the death penalty, the plaintiffs rely on four additional attachments, \nincluding one which was chiefly co‐authored by Dr. Lenza before he \ncompleted his dissertation.  Because the plaintiffs donot advance this \n‐ 38 ‐ \n\npremise as a freestanding ground for relief, this Court need not consider \nwhether McCleskey v. Kemp13 need be overruled. \n100.  In other death‐sentenced persons’ cases before the Missouri \nSupreme Court, the Missouri State Public Defender System presented a \nstudy by University of Missouri–Columbia Professor John F. Galliher of the \nreports from Missouri circuit judges that the Missouri Supreme Court itself \ncollected as the statute on proportionality review mandated.  The Missouri \nState Public Defender System filed this study with the Missouri Supreme \nCourt in State v. Parker.14  Plaintiffs present it here as Exhibit 12.  There is \nalso available on the Internet a subsequent report based on later and more \ninclusive data prepared by Professor Galliher’s original co‐author, \nProfessor David Keys, and others, headed by Dr. Michael Lenza.15  \nPlaintiffs present it as Exhibit 13. \n                                           \n13481 U.S. 279 (1987). \n14886 S.W.2d 908 (Mo. 1994) (en banc), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1098 \n(1995), citing In re Estate of Danforth, 705 S.W.2d 609, 610 (Mo. Ct. App., S.D. \n1986) (providing for judicial notice of the record resulting in an opinion to \ndetermine grounds on which opinion is based). \n15M. LENZA ET AL., THE PREVAILING INJUSTICES IN THE APPLICATION OF \nTHE DEATH PENALTY IN MISSOURI (1978‐1996) (2002), available May 18, 2004, \nat http://www.umsl.edu/divisions/artscience/forlanglit/mbp/Lenza1.html.  \n(Exhibit 13.) \n‐ 39 ‐ \n\n101.  The original Galliher report was based entirely on the reports of \nMissouri trial judges in homicide cases that the Missouri Supreme Court \ngathered in response to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 565.035.6.  The report showed that \nout of 439 death‐eligible cases during the period it covered, the prosecutors \nhad waived the death penalty in 212, or 52%.  (Exhibit 12 at 1.)  The \nremainder of the report showed that aggravating and mitigating factors \nplayed virtually no role in determining whether a person actually got the \ndeath penalty for a homicide.  (Id. at 2‐8.)  For example, in respect to eight \nof the fourteen statutory aggravating factors, sentencers were more likely \nto impose life without parole than death if they found that factor;16 in cases \nwhere accused citizens received life without parole, the sentencer found an \naverage of 2.17 statutory mitigating factors, whereas in cases where the \naccused received a death sentence, the sentencer found 2.2.17  Whereas the \nrelationship between the total number of aggravating factors and a \nsentence of death is positive, it is only slightly so.  (Id. at 2‐3.) \n102.  By contrast, the clearest, strongest predictor of whether a \nprosecutor would seek the death penalty was whether the accused was a \n                                           \n16Id. at 4‐5. \n17Id. at 6. \n‐ 40 ‐ \n\nblack person and the decedent was a white person.  In 89% of the cases in \nwhich prosecutors waived the death penalty, the accused and the decedent \nwere the same color, and prosecutors rarely charged whites for killing \nblacks.  (Id. at 11.)  Prosecutors were radically less likely to waive the death \npenalty in cases where they charged blacks with killing whites than in any \nother class of death‐eligible cases: \nFor black offenders 44 percent of those receiving the \ndeath penalty killed a white victim, 44 percent of \nblack offenders sentenced by a jury to life in prison \nkilled a white victim, but only 18 percent of black \noffenders where the death penalty was waived \nkilled a white victim.  These figures indicate that in \nMissouri the race of the victim makes little \ndifference for the legal outcome of white offenders, \nbut for black offenders killing a white victim \nseverely reduces the chances of having the death \npenalty waived by the prosecution—a reduction \nfrom 97 percent of white offenders who had killed \nwhite victims to 78 percent of black offenders who \nhad killed white victims.18 \n103.  The Galliher study examined the influence of youth on \ncharging and sentencing decisions, because it is a statutory mitigating \nfactor.  The data from the circuit judges collected by the Missouri Supreme \nCourt showed that youth was a mitigating factor for white accused citizens \nbut not for black ones: \n‐ 41 ‐ \n\nAmong cases where the prosecution waived the \ndeath penalty 14 percent of defendants were 18 \nyears old or less, and 32 percent were 21 or less with \na mean age of 28.2 years.  In cases where a jury \nhanded down a life sentence 9 percent were 18 or \nless, and 25 percent were 21 or less with a mean age \nof 28.2 years—exactly the same average age as for \ncases in which the prosecutor waived the death \npenalty.  Those receiving the death penalty were \nslightly older than others.  Prosecutors perhaps \ncorrectly perceive the common bias of jurors against \nimposing the death penalty against the very young. \n . . .  \nThe mean age of black offenders sentenced to death \nis 27.7 years, and for whites the mean age is 35 \nyears.  Twenty‐two percent of black defendants \nunder the age of 21 were sentenced to death, while \nthis was true of only 14 percent of white offenders \nunder 21.19 \nThe authors concluded that “young black defendants are in greater \njeopardy of a death sentence than are white offenders.”20 \n104.  Another factor that the Galliher study explored was the \nreputation of the decedent as a mitigating factor.  The data from the circuit \njudges, as collected by the Missouri Supreme Court, showed that the \n                                                                                                                                        \n18Id. at 11 (emphasis supplied). \n19Id. at 8. \n20Id. at 17. \n‐ 42 ‐ \n\nreputation of the decedent made a difference only if the decedent was \nwhite: \nWhile killing a white person with a bad reputation \nnearly always saved a defendant from death, it is \nmuch less likely to operate in the same fashion in \nthe case of black victims.  Perhaps this is true \nbecause all black victims were devalued whether or \nnot they were noted to have a bad reputation.21 \n105.  Prosecutors waived the death penalty as a rule if the accused \nwas a woman, as long as she was white: \nProsecutors seem less likely to seek the death \npenalty against female defendants than juries are to \nsentence females to death.  The application of this \napparent chivalry is, however, differentially \ndistributed across races.  Among death waived \ncases 20 percent of white offenders and only 3 \npercent of black offenders were females.  In other \nwords, white females were proportionately nearly \nseven times as likely to benefit from a waived death \npenalty as were black females.22 \n106.  Dr. Lenza’s study included data into 1996, and was not \navailable until 2002.  Whereas the Galliher study observed that the reports \nfrom the trial judges in the Missouri Supreme Court’s database were \nincomplete, and listed 189 names of persons in the Department of \nCorrections for death‐eligible offenses at the relevant time that were \n                                           \n21Id. at 13. \n‐ 43 ‐ \n\nmissing from the database,23 the authors of the Lenza et al. study used FBI \nSupplemental Homicide Reports to enhance their coverage.24  They divided \ncapital cases into three stages:  (1) the prosecutor’s decision whether to \ncharge a death‐eligible offense, (2) the prosecutor’s decision whether to \nseek the death penalty for a death‐eligible offense, and (3) the result of a \npenalty phase once the prosecutor had decided to seek death.25  The first \nstage accounts for most of the decision‐making, as prosecutors charged \nonly 5.8% of homicides (574 out of 9857) as death‐eligible cases; the second \nstage accounts for the next largest number of decisions, as prosecutors \nwaived the death penalty in 49% of the cases they had charged as death‐\neligible (270 out of 551).26  Of the remaining cases, circuit courts sentenced \n54% of the accused (152 out of 281) to death.27 \n107.  At the first stage, in which the prosecutor decides whether to \ncharge a homicide as “capital murder” or “first‐degree murder” \n(depending on the statutory classification of death‐eligible homicide at the \n                                                                                                                                        \n22Id. at 16. \n23Id. at 18 & attached memorandum. \n24Exhibit 13:4 \n25Id. at 4‐5. \n26Id. at 4‐5.  The authors dropped 23 cases due to insufficient data. \n‐ 44 ‐ \n\ntime of the case), Missouri prosecutors were almost twice as likely to \ncharge a black who killed a white with death‐eligible homicide as they \nwere to charge a white who killed a black:28 \nAccused/Decedent  Capital  Total  Percent \nWhite/White  274  2945  8.39% \nWhite/Black  12  254  4.72% \nBlack/Black  188  6045  3.11% \nBlack/White  88  599  14.69% \nMissing Cases  12  14  N/A \nTotals  574  9857  5.8% \nThe authors explained that these data confirmed previous studies: \nThe percentages of all Missouri homicides charged \nwith capital murder by offender/victim racial \ncharacteristics indicates blacks killing whites are 5 \ntimes more likely to be charged with capital murder \nthan blacks killing blacks.  Whites with black \nvictims are half as likely to be charged with capital \nmurder than whites killing other whites. . . . this \npattern confirms the suspicion that whiteness is \nvalued over non‐whiteness, predicting that the \nseverest punishment would be visited on cases \nwhere the non‐white offender kills a Caucasian (‐/+) \n14.69%, followed by a descending hierarchical \n                                                                                                                                        \n27Id. at 5. \n28Id. at 8. \n‐ 45 ‐ \n\nstructuring of the proportion of cases charged with \ncapital murder based on racial characteristics: \nwhites killing whites (+/+) 8.39%, whites killing \nblacks (+/‐) 4.72%, to the lowest, blacks killing \nblacks (‐/‐) 3.11%.29 \n108.  At the next stage of a capital case—the prosecutor’s decision \nwhether to waive the death penalty for a death‐eligible homicide—the \nLenza study found that the color of the accused and the color of the \ndecedent played a strong explanatory role: \nCompared to whites killing whites (W/W) one sees \nthat blacks with black victims (B/B) are 59% less \nlikely to be taken forward to trial, while blacks \nkilling whites (B/W) are 56% more likely than \n(W/W) to be taken to trial.  In the few cases where \nwhites have killed a black victim and were charged \nwith capital murder, they were 115% more likely to \nbe taken to trial than whites taking the lives of other \nwhites.  The last category, whites killing blacks \n(W/B), represents the only 12 cases in Missouri over \n18 years in which white defendants were charged \nwith capital murder for killing an African‐\nAmerican, a mere 2% of the total cases.30 \n109.  In contrast to the decisions made by prosecutors, the Lenza et \nal. study found, the decisions made by judges and juries in the third stage \nof a capital case—the actual sentence—did not reflect bias according to the \n                                           \n29Id. at 14 (emphasis supplied). \n30Id. at 15. \n‐ 46 ‐ \n\ncolor of the accused or the color of the decedent.31  The Lenza et al. study \nfound other factors—such as low socio‐economic status of the accused and \nthe availability of gruesome photographs to inflame the jury—that were \nassociated with prosecutorial decisions to seek death.32  For example, \nwhereas juries and sentencing judges did not in fact respond measurably \ndifferently to cases involving the use of firearms as opposed to knives, \nprosecutors were 133% more likely to seek the death penalty in knife cases, \nsuch as Mr. Taylor’s case, because they produce more gruesome \nphotographs they could use to inflame the jury, as this prosecutor did, \nregardless of the relative moral blameworthiness of the offense.33  The \nconclusions of the Lenza study pointed to prosecutorial discretion as the \nmain cause of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty in Missouri: \nthe seat of prosecutorial discretion is also the \nlocation of and the mechanism responsible for the \ngreatest racial disproportionality in capital \nsentencing [in] Missouri.  It is those elements of the \nprocess, in the hands of prosecutors, who are \ncharged with selecting offenders and crimes for \neventual capital consideration and sentencing, that \n                                           \n31Id. at 15‐16. \n32Id. at 17‐19 & 20‐22. \n33Id. at 17‐18. \n‐ 47 ‐ \n\nput in place factors which proportionate sentencing \nhas sought to avoid.34 \n110.  In 2001, the Executive Director of the ACLU of Eastern Missouri \npresented data on Missouri death sentences both from the time the state \ncreated a central execution process in 1937 until 1965, when the pre‐Furman \nmoratorium took effect, and then from the post‐Gregg reinstitution of the \ndeath penalty until the date the paper was written in October 2001.35  This \nstudy, which was obviously not available at the time of the plaintiff’s \nconsolidated appeal, complements the data the Missouri State Public \nDefender System had provided the Missouri Supreme Court in State v. \nParker.  Initially this paper emphasizes the variation among counties in the \nstate:  several sizable counties had no one under sentence of death, \nregardless of their homicide rate.36 \n111.

Although this state is executing more white men, its death \npenalty continues to fall on black men convicted of killing whites far out of \nproportion to any other combination of homicide convicts and their \ndecedents.  While the death penalty continues to target black men out of \nproportion to their numbers, it has added white men to the pie of persons \nexecuted and has thereby decreased the proportion of blacks. \n113.  A 2003 article—which is not limited to Missouri data—shows \nthat support for the death penalty among white people tends to vary \n                                           \n37Id. at 1‐2. \n38Id. at 11. \n39Id. at 11‐12. \n‐ 49 ‐ \n\nstrongly according to a combination of racial prejudice and the proximity \nof black residents to the person surveyed:40 \nas the black percentage of a county’s population \nrises, racial prejudice becomes a much more \npowerful predictor of whether a white person will \nstrongly favor state executions.  Indeed, the effect of \ncontext on the relationship between prejudice and \nwhite support is dramatic.  Among white people \nwho live in all‐white counties, the largest possible \nincrease in prejudice (from 0 to 100) produces only a \n34‐point increase in the probability of strong death \npenalty support (from .52 to .86).  By contrast, when \nthe black percentage of the county population \nstands just below 20%, the same increase in \nprejudice raises the probability of strong support \nfrom fairly unlikely (.29) to a virtual certainty (.95).  \nThus, the interplay of racial beliefs and racial \nproximity go far to explain strong white preferences \nfor state executions—but neither factor can be \nadequately understood in isolation from the other.41 \n114.  The case against Plaintiff Taylor arose in Jackson County, one \nwith a high proportion of African‐American citizens, yet one in which they \nare a distinct minority.  This is exactly the kind of jurisdiction in which the \nforegoing article would predict a high correlation between racist attitudes \nand support for the death penalty. \n                                           \n40J. SOSS ET AL., Why Do White Americans Support the Death Penalty? 65 \nJ. OF POLITICS 397, 409 (2003).  (Exhibit 15.) \n41Id. at 411. \n‐ 50 ‐ \n\n115.  As elected officers who retain their positions at the will of the \nelectorate, Missouri prosecutors are presumptively aware of and \nresponsive to the level of support for the death penalty.  In its current form, \nthe prosecutorial discretion created by Missouri statutes leads to racial \ndiscrimination in the imposition of the death penalty.  The longitudinal \ndata in the latter two articles cited in this response raise the question \nwhether after Furman and Gregg have addressed various aspects of fairness \nat the jury and trial‐judge level, it is possible in any case for there to be a \ndeath‐charging decision which is free from impermissible attention—one \nway or the other—to the color of the accused and the color of the decedent. \n116.  Because the death penalty as practiced in Missouri both before \nand after Furman and Gregg is disproportionately applied against African‐\nAmerican men like Stanley Hall, Donald Jones, and Vernon Brown—and \nplaintiff Taylor—the fact that it is more tortuous than it need be is \nconsistent with the behavior Dr. Lenza found beginning with the \nintroduction of slavery into the Missouri Territory. \n117.  The use of a gratuitously painful form of suffocation, followed \nby the burning through the veins and the heart attack caused by potassium \nchloride, instead of a single, lethal dose of an otherwise legitimate \n‐ 51 ‐ \n\nmedication such as pentobarbital is evidence that the state keeps the death \npenalty around primarily for “them.” \n118.  The proposition that the death penalty itself bears more heavily \nagainst blacks than whites is not before this Court as a claim for relief.  In \nlight of this fact, however, the additional fact that the defendants use a \nspecial form of lethal injection which creates a foreseeable, completely \nunnecessary, risk of inflicting gratuitous pain and suffering, when the \nexecutions of slaves and their descendants have historically been more \npainful than the execution of others in a slave jurisdiction such as Missouri, \n is a badge or vestige of slavery over and above the existence of the death \npenalty in the abstract and over and above the judicial decision to impose \nthe death penalty in a given case. \n119.  The foregoing reasoning applies with equal force to Mr. Clay \nnotwithstanding the fact that he is white.  The numbers of persons \nexecuted before and after Furman and Gregg show that Missouri has \nincreased the number of executions per year by increasing the number of \nwhite men it has executed.  Of course that might just be a coincidence, but \nanother view would be that state actors execute more white men, like Mr. \nClay, in order to maintain the practice of capital punishment which \n‐ 52 ‐ \n\ncontinues to bear disproportionately on black men, like Mr. Taylor.  The \nracist character of this practice is unaffected by the selection of a relatively \nsmall proportion of white homicide convicts to improve the numbers \nunder sentence of death when one takes account of the color of the \ndecedent, which shows that the State of Missouri values a white life six \ntimes more highly than it values a black life. \nVII.  Claims for Relief \n120.  Plaintiff restates and realleges the contents of each preceding \nparagraph as if fully set forth again. \nCount I \n121.  Unless this Court stops them, the defendants, acting \nindividually and under color of state law, will violate the plaintiffs’ right to \nbe free of cruel and unusual punishments secured to them by the Eighth \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied against the \nstates by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment by executing them using \nthe sequence of three chemicals (sodium pentothal a/k/a thiopental, \npancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) which they have admitted \nto be their practice in their discovery responses in Johnston v. Kempker as \naforesaid, which is unnecessary as a means of employing lethal injection \n‐ 53 ‐ \n\nand not required by the statute creating this form of execution in the State \nof Missouri, and which creates a foreseeable risk of inflicting gratuitous \npain and suffering. \nCount II \n122.  Unless this Court stops them, the defendants, acting \nindividually and under color of state law, will violate the plaintiffs’ right to \nbe free of cruel and unusual punishments secured to them by the Eighth \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied against the \nstates by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment by executing them using \na painful, invasive, involuntary procedure to gain access to a central vein \nfor the purpose of killing them rather than treating them. \nCount III \n123.  Unless this Court stops them, the defendants, acting \nindividually and under color of state law, will violate the plaintiffs’ right to \ndue process of law as guaranteed by section 1 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment by executing them by unlawfully using a physician to carry \nout essential steps in an execution in violation of medical ethics. \nCount IV \n124.  Defendants’ chosen use of a specific form of lethal injection \nwhich is more painful than necessary to bring about the statutory objective \n‐ 54 ‐ \n\nof killing the condemned person is a vestige and badge of slavery, and \ntherefore violates the Thirteenth Amendment as well as the Eighth and \nFourteenth, and impinges on the vertical‐equity (color and socio‐economic \nstatus of accused) and horizontal‐equity (irrationality of who among the \nmass of homicide defendants gets the death penalty, even irrespective of \ncolor and SES) prongs of Eighth Amendment analysis (applied against the \nstates through the Fourteenth) as well as the severity prong, the latter of \nwhich is the focus of Counts I‐III. \nVIII.  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n125.  Plaintiffd have exhausted any available administrative remedy \nfor the issues contained in this complaint, because the selection of \nchemicals for lethal injection is not a grievable issue within the meaning of \nthe administrative grievance procedure as adopted and applied by the \ndefendants’ actual penological agents as distinguished from the \nDepartment’s outside counsel in the Attorney General’s Office, and these \nagents have so informed him in response to his attempt to seek \nadministrative remedies.  (Exhibit 16.) \n‐ 55 ‐ \n\n126.  As noted, in the Johnston, Jones, and Brown litigation, the \ndefendants initially asserted that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust \nadministrative remedies. \n127.  In Johnston, the defendants’ clients in the Department of \nCorrections had admitted, by signed notation on Mr. Johnston’s IRR, that \nthe issue of which chemicals the executioners use is “non‐grievable.”  \n(Exhibit 5). \n128.  Counsel for the defendants in Johnston (who were also counsel \nfor the defendants in Jones and Brown) recognized this fact by dropping the \nnonexhaustion point in the reply to Mr. Johnston’s response to which the \nIRR was attached as an exhibit.  (Exhibit 6.) \n129.  The same counsel raised the same defense in Jones, knowing \nthat this issue was not grievable according to the Department of \nCorrections, in whose favor the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997e is supposed to run; the Court relied on her representations; Mr. \nJones was executed by the use of the specific chemical sequence which Mr. \nJohnston’s pleadings and Mr. Jones’s pleadings showed to create a \nforeseeable risk of inflicting gratuitous pain and suffering in violation of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n‐ 56 ‐ \n\n130.  As of the time this claim manifested itself beyond cavil with the \npublication of the LANCET article, Vernon Brown was not only aware of \nwhat happened to Mr. Johnston’s grievance but had also heard that when \nother prisoners have attempted to file IRR’s on this issue, the staff of the \nDepartment of Corrections have actually refused to give them IRR forms \nbecause of the Department’s position that the issue was not grievable.  \n(Exhibit 8.) \n131.  Nonetheless, on the advice of counsel, Mr. Brown filed an IRR, \nand plaintiff Taylor submitted with the original complaint in this action a \ntrue and correct copy of it with the above‐referenced affidavit by Mr. \nBrown as Exhibit 8.  This filing was expressly made in an abundance of \ncaution and not by way of admission that the issue is grievable \nnotwithstanding the well‐established position of the Department of \nCorrections, reflected both to the federal courts through counsel and to the \nprisoners affected by the issue by the staff of the Department. \n132.  Because the issue of how the state does lethal injections is not \nwithin the scope of the Department of Corrections grievance policy, this \ncomplaint is not subject to the requirement of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. \n‐ 57 ‐ \n\n133.  Parties in privity with the State of Missouri, such as these \ndefendants, are estopped to assert the nonexhaustion of administrative \nremedies because the Department of Corrections does not consider this \nissue grievable (and their attorneys know it). \n134.  In Mr. Brown’s case, the staff who responded to Mr. Brown’s \nIRR changed the response from what it had been in Johnston and what Mr. \nBrown had heard it had been to other prisoners under sentence of death, \nand asserted that Mr. Brown—whose execution date had already been \nset—had to pursue multiple levels of review in order to exhaust \nadministrative remedies on the issue.  (Exhibit 9.) \n135.  In Mr. Brown’s case, the district court relied on these \nrepresentations to deny a temporary restraining order.  A divided United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a stay of execution, as \ndid the United States Supreme Court over the dissenting votes of four \nJustices, and Mr. Brown was executed on May 18, 2005. \n136.  Plaintiff Taylor filed an Informal Resolution Request, and the \nstaff returned it to him with the explanation that he could not file it because \nthe subject‐matter of the issue was not grievable but was involved in \nlitigation.  (Exhibit 16.)  Defendants’ counsel are estopped to contradict \n‐ 58 ‐ \n\ntheir clients’ correct interpretation of their own administrative regulations \nin order to avoid this issue once more. \n137.  After counsel had prepared and circulated a complete draft of \nthis complaint, he received a telephone call from plaintiff Taylor, indicating \nthat the staff had told the plaintiff he could, after all, file an IRR, but that \nthere was no guaranty the result would be any different.  Plaintiff \nproceeded with the re‐filing of an IRR. \n138.  On or about September 1, 2005, agents of the Department of \nCorrections returned the “appeal” to plaintiff Taylor, after which there is \nno even arguable recourse for him within the state’s grievance process.  By \npursuing this process to the full extent the state even pretended to offer \none, however, this plaintiff does not admit that there was an available \ngrievance process.  The subject‐matter fell outside the language of the \nfederal statute offering this defense to participating states and the state \nregulation defining the scope of the process.  The state and its agents have \nnot regularly followed a position that there was any administrative remedy \nfor this grievance.   Once the institutional staff indicated the issue was not \ngrievable or not subject to resolution at the institutional level, there was \nnothing further the state could do for the plaintiff by this process. \n‐ 59 ‐ \n\n139.  Pendency of this new IRR from the filing of this action through \nits return to plaintiff Taylor is not a cloud on this complaint.  Selection of a \nspecific means of lethal injection is not a “prison condition” within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), the source of the requirement of \nexhaustion of administrative remedies.  Selection of a specific means of \nlethal injection is not a matter of “institutional life” within the meaning of \nthe administrative remedy the Department of Corrections adopted to take \nadvantage of section 1997e.  (Exhibit 17 at 2, ¶ D5‐3.2, II.J.)  Defendants’ \nagents have admitted the inapplicability of the grievance procedure in \nJohnston.  (Exhibits 5‐6.) \n140.  This Court should not allow the defendants to avoid \naccountability for their actions by invoking section 1997e.  Their shift of \nground in the Vernon Brown case was belied by their attorneys’ admissions \nin the hearing on Mr. Brown’s motion for a temporary restraining order.  \nDuring the hearing, the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies was \ndiscussed at some length.  Defendants represented the complete exhaustion \nof administrative remedies requires three steps:  (1) the filing of an IRR, (2) \nthe filing of a grievance, and (3) the filing of a grievance appeal.  (Exhibit 18 \nat 60.)  Defendants further represented the grievance is filed with the \n‐ 60 ‐ \n\nsuperintendent of the institution where the prisoner is incarcerated, and \nthe grievance appeal is addressed by “central office,” which counsel for the \ndefendants elided with defendant Crawford, the Director of the \nDepartment of Corrections.  (Id. at 61‐62.) \n141.  In Vernon Brown’s case, the defendants—who were the same as \nthe defendants in Johnston and Jones, and one of whom was opposing \ncounsel on these  plaintiffs’ federal habeas corpus petition and on his \nmotion to recall the mandate of the Missouri Supreme Court—conceded \nthat the corrections classification worker who would address the initial IRR \nhas no authority to change the lethal injection protocol; they further \nconceded the superintendent of the institution where the prisoner is \nincarcerated has no authority to change the protocol for the lethal injection. \n (Id. at 61.)  They admitted the only person with authority to change the \nprotocol would be defendant Crawford.  When asked whether an inmate \nhad the ability to bring an initial grievance before the Director, they \nconceded there was no procedure for that: \nTHE COURT:  Okay. Could Mr. [Brown] have \nbypassed the IRR procedure and the grievance?  \nSince it is clear that no one at the institution had \nauthority to make any changes, could he have \nbypassed the institutional officials and gone directly \nto the director with his complaint? \n‐ 61 ‐ \n\nMS. McElvein:  No, your Honor.  Not that I am \naware of.  [Id. at 62‐63.] \n142.  There is therefore no administrative process available to the \nplaintiff to grieve this claim.  By the defendants’ admissions in open court, \nthe Director’s role in the normal administrative process is to function as an \nappellate decisionmaker, reviewing the disposition of the grievance filed \nwith the superintendent of the institution where the prisoner is \nincarcerated.  In this case, the defendants concede that the superintendent \nof an institution, even of the institution where the executions occur, has no \nauthority—no jurisdiction—to change the protocol for lethal injections.  \nThus, as the appellate decisionmaker reviewing any decision made by the \nsuperintendent, the only role the Director would serve would be to \ndetermine whether the superintendent correctly determined the \nsuperintendent had no authority to change the chemicals which other \npersonnel use in lethal injections.  The Director’s appellate role in the \nadministrative grievance process is not the same as his role as the initial \ndecisionmaker.  Here, the defendants have conceded there was no \nadministrative grievance procedure available to seek to change the \nDirector’s position as the initial decisionmaker, rather than in the role of an \nappellate decisionmaker reviewing the question whether the \n‐ 62 ‐ \n\nsuperintendent had the authority to determine which chemicals to use, \nwhich they concede he does not. \n143.  It is therefore irrelevant whether the staff of the Department of \nCorrections adhere to their correct position that the issue in theseplaintiffs’ \nIRR is not grievable, or attempt to manipulate this Court as they did a sister \ncourt in Vernon Brown’s case by moving the goalposts. \n144.  Missouri does not provide an administrative grievance process \nfor presenting this issue, and therefore section 1997e would not apply even \nif the method of execution were a “prison condition,” even if “institutional \ndeath” equaled “institutional life,” and even if the United Nations \nConvention Against Torture were not part of “the supreme law of the \nland” requiring the United States to afford the plaintiff a forum for raising \nthis issue. \nIX.  Prayer for Relief \n145.  Initially, the plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent \nthe defendants from executing either or them until the defendants have \nresponded to their discovery (including what appears to be the inevitable \ntime it will take to litigate motions to compel as Mr. Johnson had to do) and \nuntil this Court has adjudicated his underlying claim for relief on the \n‐ 63 ‐ \n\nmerits (including the time it would take for any appeal from the \ndisposition). \n146.  Second, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment holding that \nthe defendants’ current means, methods, practices, procedures, and \ncustoms regarding execution by lethal injection violate the Eighth, \nThirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. \n147.  Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction preventing the \ndefendants from using their current means, methods, practice, procedures, \nand customs regarding execution by lethal injection. \n148.  Finally, the plaintiffs seek an order granting them reasonable \nattorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and the laws of the United States; for \nhis costs of suit; and for such other and further relief as the Court deems \nappropriate. \n‐ 64 ‐ \n\nWHEREFORE, the plaintiffs pray the Court for its orders as \naforesaid. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ JOHN WILLIAM SIMON     /s ELIZABETH UNGAR CARLYLE \n \n2683 South Big Bend Blvd, # 12    200 S.E. Douglas, Suite 200 \nSt. Louis, Missouri  63143‐2100    Lee’s Summit, Missouri  64063‐2375 \n \n   (314) 645‐1776             (816) 525‐9652 \n   FAX (314) 645‐2125           FAX (816) 525‐1917 \n \n  Attorney for Plaintiff Taylor      Attorney for Plaintiff Clay \n \nCertificate of Service \nI hereby certify a true and correct copy of the foregoing was \nforwarded for transmission via Electronic Case Filing (ECF) this twelfth \nday of September, 2005, to the offices of: \nMichael Pritchett, Esq. \nAssistant Attorney General \nP.O. Box 899 \nJefferson City, Missouri  65102 \n \n/s/ John William Simon \nAttorney for Plaintiff Taylor \n‐ 65 ‐ ",

This protocol has been prepared by the defendant\nCorrections officials and is presented for Court review as directed by this Court’s order of\nJune 26, 2006.  In this order, the Court ordered the Corrections defendants to incorporate the\nfollowing provisions in its proposed protocol:\n(1) Use of a board certified anesthesiologist to mix all drugs used in the lethal\ninjection process and to directly observe the persons administering those drugs.\n(2) Use of not less  than five grams of thiopental.  Pancuronium bromide and\npotassium chloride may be used, but not until after certification by the anesthesiologist that\nthe condemned prisoner has reached a sufficient anesthetic depth so that the prisoner will not\nexperience undue pain when the potassium chloride is injected.  The protocol is to specify\nhow sufficient anesthetic depth is to be certified.\n(3) Implementation of procedures that allow adequate monitoring of the anesthetic\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 2 of 12(cid:10)\ndepth of the condemned prisoner.\n(4) Implementation of a contingency plan in case the execution procedure does not go\nas expected.\n(5) Implementation of an auditing process to check that the execution protocol is being\ncorrectly carried out.\nThe protocol developed by the Department of Corrections addresses the concerns\nraised by plaintiff at trial.  Although the protocol does not completely implement all the\nprovisions set out by the Court, the Corrections defendants believe that the protocol does\nappropriately meet the underlying concern of the Court that condemned  prisoners be\nsufficiently unconscious at the time of the injection of the potassium chloride that they will\nnot experience pain from the injection.1\nAdministration of Drugs\nThe  proposed  protocol  calls  for  use  of  five  grams  of  thiopental.    ¶¶  B2,  E2.\nPancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered after the thiopental but not\nuntil after an assessment by medical personnel that the condemned prisoner is unconscious.\nThis assessment is to include use of standard clinical techniques for assessing consciousness,\nsuch as checking for movement, open eyes, eyelash reflex, pupillary responses or diameters,\n1The Court’s order requires several elements to the revised Missouri execution\nprotocol.  Defendant Correction officials submit the proposed protocol as one they believe\nis a good policy instrument.  They do not concede that the provisions of the proposed\nprotocol are constitutionally required.  Indeed, defendant Corrections officials note that the\nCourt does not identify which elements of its June 26, 2006 order it believes are mandated\nby the Eighth Amendment.  \n-2-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 3 of 12(cid:10)\nand response to verbal commands and physical stimuli.  ¶ E3.\nMonitoring of Anesthetic Depth\nAs just noted, standard clinical techniques for assessing consciousness will be used.\nThis will be done by direct physical contact with the condemned prisoner following the\nadministration of the thiopental.  ¶ E3.  Additionally, the bed on which the condemned\ninmate is lying will be positioned so that the medical personnel can observe the prisoner’s\nface directly or with the aid of a mirror.  ¶ D2.\nContingency Plan\nAn additional five grams of thiopental is prepared before the execution for use in the\nevent that the administration of the first five grams does not render the condemned prisoner\nunconscious.  ¶ B8.  A secondary intravenous (IV) line will be set in addition to the primary\nline.  ¶ C1.  In the event the administration of the first 5 grams of thiopental has not rendered\nthe prisoner unconscious, the additional five grams of thiopental that have been prepared will\nbe administered through the secondary line, as will the succeeding drugs.  ¶ E4.  In the event\nthat electrical activity continues in the condemned prisoner’s heart for more than five minutes\nafter the final flush solution is injected, additional potassium chloride will be injected.\n¶ E10.\nAuditing Process\nAll  members  of  the  execution  team  will  complete  and  sign  the  “Sequence  of\nChemicals” form that verifies that the drugs were given in the order specified in the protocol.\n¶ F2.  The medical personnel taking part in the execution will complete and sign the\n-3-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 4 of 12(cid:10)\n“Chemical Log” indicating the quantities of the drugs used (as well as the quantities disposed\nof) during (and after) the execution.  ¶ F3.  Within three days of an execution, the prison\nsuperintendent will submit the “Sequence of Chemicals” and the “Chemical Log” to the\nDirector  of  the  Division  of  Adult  Institutions  (DAI)  of  the  Missouri  Department  of\nCorrections.  ¶ F4.  The DAI Director and the Department Director will review these records.\n¶ F4.  If any irregularity is found, the DAI Director will promptly determine whether there\nwere any deviations form this protocol and report the findings of the investigation to the\nDepartment Director.  ¶ F4. \nObtaining the Use of a Board Certified Anesthesiologist\nInability to obtain and use board certified anesthesiologist.  The Department of\nCorrections is unable to comply with the Court’s direction to obtain and use a board certified\nanesthesiologist in its execution process.2  After the Court issued its June 26, 2006 order,\ndefendant Corrections officials sent letters to 298 board certified anesthesiologists in this\nState and southern Illinois inquiring of their willingness to participate in executions, as\noutlined by the court’s order.   To this date, no one has accepted.  See Exhibit B, attached to\nthis pleading.\n2The Court’s order calls for a board certified anesthesiologist to mix the drugs to be\nused, to observe the administration of the drugs, to monitor the anesthetic depth of the\ncondemned prisoner, and to certify that the condemned prisoner has achieved sufficient\nanesthetic depth to be free of undue pain when the potassium chloride is injected.  As shown\nabove, these functions will be performed by medical personnel.  Standards for determining\nunconsciousness and the means of monitoring the condemned prisoner throughout the\nprocess are also set out.  Additionally, a board certified anesthesiologist has provided\nguidance in the development of this protocol.\n-4-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 5 of 12(cid:10)\nThis reaction by the medical community is unsurprising.  It was foreshadowed in the\nNinth Circuit opinion in Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1074 (9th Cir. 2005).  And\nas plaintiff alleged in his amended complaint, a physician’s participation may be perceived\nas a violation of a professional’s ethical standards.  See Amended Complaint, at ¶ 81, citing\nAmerican Medical Association’s Code of Ethics, E-2.06, which is itself attached as Exhibit\n22 to the Amended Complaint.\nThe hostility of the anesthesiologist community to the Court’s order was swift.  The\nJune 30, 2006 message from the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologist to\nmember anesthesiologist is perhaps best summarized by its last two words of advice: “[s]teer\nclear.” See Exhibit C, at p. 4, attached to this pleading.  So they have.  See Exhibit B,\nattached to this pleading.\nRather than write a protocol with a role for an anaesthesiologist, complying with the\nletter of the Court’s June 26, 2006 order, but not its spirit of developing a protocol that could\nactually  be  implemented,  the  proposed  protocol  does  not  include  a  board  certified\nanesthesiologist.  Instead, it uses medical personnel in roles appropriate for the personnel.\nFor example, a physician, nurse, or pharmacist prepares the chemicals.  ¶¶ A2, B1.  The\nthiopental will be prepared in 200 cc of solution (¶ B2), the amount of solution recommended\nby the manufacturer (Plaintiff’s Trial Exhibit 26).  The other chemicals do not require mixing\nbecause they are packaged as liquids ready to inject.  \nMedical personnel insert the IV lines.  ¶ C1.  They attach the electrocardiograph to\nthe condemned, and then monitor the machine.  ¶¶ D1, D3.  After injection of five grams of\n-5-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 6 of 12(cid:10)\nthiopental, medical personnel inspect the catheter site and physically examine the prisoner\nto  confirm  he  is  unconscious.    ¶  B3.    Only  if  the  medical  personnel  has  confirmed\nunconsciousness and three minutes have elapsed since the beginning of the injection of the\nthiopental will there be an injection of the second and third chemicals.  ¶ B5.  Even under Dr.\nHenthorn’s modeling, the passage of three minutes is sufficient to render the condemned\nunconscious.  Tr. (June 12) 228.  But if not, corrections officials stand ready to provide a\nsecond five gram injection of the thiopental.  ¶¶ B8, E4.  \nThe proposed protocol is sufficient to prevent unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain.    The  substitution  of  medical  personnel  for  a  board  certified  anesthesiologist  is\nreasonable  under  the  circumstances.    A  requirement  of  using  a  board  certified\nanesthesiologist is a requirement that cannot presently be met.  To enforce it may effectively\nbar implementation of the death penalty in Missouri.  Surely that is not what the court\nintended.\nUse of anesthesiologist not constitutionally required.  Even if it were possible for the\nDepartment of Corrections to find a board certified anesthesiologist to provide services\nduring executions, the Corrections defendants respectfully contend that the district court\nlegally erred in imposing such a requirement.  Assistance of an anesthesiologist at an\nexecution has never been determined to be constitutionally required3 and, for this reason, the\n3In fact, it appears from reported opinions that at least two states conduct judicially\napproved executions without the presence of a doctor of any kind.  Abdur’rahman v.\nBredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 301 (Tenn. 2005) (describing a process in which the prison\nwarden prepares the drugs and a non-physician prison official injects the drugs; a physician\nis on site only to perform a “cut down” procedure in the event the paramedics, two of whom\n-6-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 7 of 12(cid:10)\norder goes beyond the Court’s power in requiring the assistance of an anesthesiologist in\nMissouri executions. \nThe one case defendants have found that directly examined the issue of whether the\nassistance  of  an  anesthesiologist  is  required  during  executions  concluded  that  an\nanesthesiologist is not required.  Evans v. Saar, 412 F. Supp. 2d 519, 524-25 (D. Md. 2006)\n(denying injunction to stay execution).  See also Bieghler v. State, 839 N.E.2d 691, 695-96\n(Ind.  2005)  (denying  habeas  relief  despite  challenge  that  state  had  not  developed  its\nexecution protocol with input from a person trained in anesthesiology), cert. denied, 126\nS. Ct. 1190 (2006).  Not even the decision in Morales v. Hickman, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1037\n(N.D. Cal. 2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1314 (2006),\nrelied on by plaintiff, requires use of anesthesiologist for either option approved by the\ndistrict court.  One option permitted by the Morales court was execution by means of a\nmassive dose of thiopental alone or some other barbiturate or combination of barbiturates,\nwithout any direction that a doctor be present.  415 F. Supp. 2d at 1047.  Even the second\noption required only a person with formal training and experience in the field of general\nanesthesia and not necessarily a board certified anesthesiologist.  Id.\nFurther, the evidence from this case establishes that an execution can be carried out\nare present at the execution, are unable to insert an IV in the condemned’s arm), cert. denied,\n126 S. Ct. 2288 (2006); Ex parte Aguilar, 2006 WL 1412666, at *4 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App.,\nMay 22, 2006) (reference in Concurring Statement to suggestion of plaintiff’s expert witness\nthat lethal injection procedure “should be performed by and reviewed by doctors”), stay of\nexecution denied sub nom. Aguilar v. Dretke, 2006 WL 1667012 (U.S. Sup. Ct., May 24,\n2006).\n-7-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 8 of 12(cid:10)\nwithout  unnecessary  and  wanton  pain  without  the  assistance  of  a  board  certified\nanesthesiologist.  The protocol proposed by the Department of Corrections complies with the\nconstitutional standard.  Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Henthorn agreed that a five gram dose of\nthiopental would result in the condemned being rendered deeply unconscious (more so than\nthe level of consciousness intended for surgical procedures) within two minutes and for a\nmuch longer time period than required to complete the execution.  Tr. (June 12) 235-36.\nThus, if five grams of thiopental is administered, there would be no need to monitor the\nanesthetic depth of the condemned for some time.  Tr. (June 12) 236-37.  Therefore, even\nunder plaintiff’s evidence, once five grams of thiopental is administered and given two\nminutes to take effect, monitoring of anesthetic depth is not necessary to assure that a\ncondemned  prisoner  will  not  experience  unnecessary  and  wanton  pain  during  the\nadministration of the next two drugs.\nAssurance that the thiopental prepared is administered appropriately is important, and\nthe protocol developed by the Department of Corrections does implement steps to provide\nsuch assurance.  A doctor, nurse, or pharmacist is to prepare the thiopental.  ¶ A2.  This is\na straight-forward matter of mixing a powder with a liquid found in a manufacturer’s kit.  See\nEvans, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 524-25; Tr. (Jan. 30) 30-31.4  Two IV lines are set by persons with\n4The difficulty in mixing referred to by Dr. John Doe I in his/her deposition (entered\ninto evidence) was the result of attempting to mix the thiopental at a concentration higher\nthan  normally  used.    Under  the  attached  protocol  developed  by  the  Department  of\nCorrections, the five grams thiopental will be administered in 200 cc of solution, which is\nthe standard 2 ½ % solution (25 mg per mL [equivalent to cc]).  See Exhibit D, attached to\nthis pleading (page from Physician’s Desk Reference setting out information on contents of\nmanufacturer’s kits).  Thus, the preparation of the thiopental will no longer present the\n-8-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 9 of 12(cid:10)\ntraining, education, and experience in doing so.  ¶¶ A3, C1.  The setting of IV lines is a\nprocedure within the competence of doctors, nurses, and emergency medical technicians. 5\nReid v. Johnson, 333 F. Supp. 2d 543, 546 n.6 (E.D. Va. 2004); State v. Webb, 750 A.2d 448,\n452 (Conn. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 93 (2000).  At the time the IV lines are set, they\nare checked to make certain they are not obstructed.  ¶ C2.  The medical person who is to\nassess the consciousness of the condemned prisoner between the administration of the\nthiopental and the succeeding drugs will also check the IV catheter site at that time as well.\n¶ E.3.  These steps will provide assurance that the thiopental has been appropriately\nadministered, which in turn, as discussed above, renders the need to assess anesthetic depth\nunnecessary.6\nAnother point raised by plaintiff at the trial is also addressed in the protocol.  Dr.\nHenthorn testified that waiting to two minutes after injection of thiopental before injecting\nproblems dealt with by Dr. Doe.\n5The provision that permits a emergency medical technician (EMT) to set IV lines and\nto check them for obstructions is not a step back from previous Department of Corrections\npractice of obtaining the presence of a doctor at executions.  Permitting the medical roles to\nbe filled by an EMT is only a foresighted recognition that there may be a time that the\npresence of a doctor cannot be obtained.  In such a case Corrections will plan to go forward\nwith the execution with the aid of an EMT, just as it would have had a doctor not been\navailable in the past.  The intent of the Department of Corrections is to obtain the presence\nof a doctor at executions if at all possible.\n6Even though vigilant attention to proper administration of the thiopental will provide\nassurance that the condemned prisoner has reached a quite deep level of unconsciousness\nbefore the succeeding drugs are administered, the medical person present at the execution\nwill still assess the consciousness of the condemned with standard clinical techniques before\nthe second two drugs are administered.  ¶ E3.\n-9-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 10 of 12(cid:10)\nthe succeeding drugs would substantially reduce the risk of pain to the condemned prisoner.\nTr. (June 12) 228.  This concern is allayed by the provision in the protocol that calls for the\nsecond and third drugs not to be administered sooner than three minutes have elapsed since\nthe beginning of the injection of the thiopental.  ¶ E5.\nThe protocol as drafted provides an ample level of confidence that condemned\nprisoners  executed  under  its  provisions  will  not  be  subjected  to  cruel  and  unusual\npunishment.\nA court may exercise its power only on the basis of a constitutional violation.  Swann\nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1276 (1971).  “The court’s exercise of\nequitable discretion must heel close to the identified violation and respect ‘the interests of\nstate and local authorities in managing their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution.’”\nGilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 1005 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 97\nS. Ct. 2749, 2757 (1977)).  See also Toussaint v.

As discussed\nabove, no court has ever found that assistance of an anesthesiologist is constitutionally\n-10-\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 198     Filed 07/14/2006     Page 11 of 12(cid:10)\nrequired at an execution.  Moreover, as shown above, there is no necessity here, considering\nthe evidence adduced and the protocol developed by the Department of Corrections, to\nrequire the assistance of a board certified anesthesiologist at executions  in  Missouri.\nImposing such a requirement is much broader than necessary to remedy the concerns of the\nCourt.\nWHEREFORE, the defendant Corrections officials, pray this Court to approve the\nprotocol developed by the Department of Corrections.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEREMIAH W.

The Prison Officials have \ndemonstrated here (as they did previously in Johnston v.  Crawford, No. 4:04-CV-\n1075 CAS (E.D. Mo. Aug. 26, 2005»  that Missouri's method oflethal injection does \nnot  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment.  Additionally,  the  Prison  Officials  have \nestablished that the presence of a doctor during executions is neither a breach of \nmedical ethics nor a violation of the condemned prisoner's due process rights, and \nalso that Missouri's execution procedure does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nAppellee Taylor pled guilty to  first  degree murder,  armed criminal  action, \nkidnapping and forcible rape for which he was sentenced to death, fifty years, fifteen \n\nFEB-01-2006  15:35  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.03 \nyears, and life imprisonment, all sentences to run consecutively. The court affirmed \nthe convictions and sentences as well as the denial of post-conviction relief. State v. \nTaylor, 929 S.W.2d 209 (Mo. banc 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1152 (1997). \nTaylor initiated a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District \nCourt for the Western District of Missouri. The district court denied the petition, and \nthe \nthe court of appeals affirmed.  Taylor v. Bowersox, 329 F.3d 963 (8 Cir. 2003), \ncert. denied, 541 U.S. 947 (2004). \nOn June 3, 2005, Taylor filed a suit asserting civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 that his execution by means of Missouri's lethal injection procedure would \nviolate his constitutional rights. On November 22,2005, the Missouri Supreme Court \nsustained the state's motion to set an execution date.  Then, on January 3, 2006, the \nSupreme Court of Missouri set an execution date of February 1,2006, for Taylor. On \nJanuary 19,2006, the district court entered its order in this case prohibiting Taylor's \nexecution on February 1 and directing that no execution take place until the court \nheld a hearing on the merits beginning on February 21,2006, and further order of the \ncourt. \nThe Prison Officials appealed and moved to vacate this order.  On January 29, \n2006, this Court vacated the district court's order, directed an immediate hearing to \nresolve the issues, and entered its own stay of execution through January 6, 2006. \nThe district court held a full hearing on the merits (via telephone to accommodate the \n-2-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:35  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.04 \nwitnesses, three out of four of whom were doctors who reside in other states) on \nJanuary 30 and 31.  On January 31, the district court ruled against Taylor on all his \nclaims and entered judgment in favor ofthe Prison Officials.  Thereafter, following \na motion by the Prison Officials, this Court vacated its earlier stay, but entered a new \nstay through 5 p.m. on February 1,2006.  In the meantime, Taylor filed this appeal. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nReview of the Stay.  The Supreme Court set forth the standard of review for \nstays in Bowersox v.  Williams, 517 U.S. 345 (1996). \nA stay of execution pending disposition of the second or successive \nfederal habeas petition should be granted only when there are \"substantial \ngrounds upon which relief might be granted ..... Entry of a stay on a \nsecond or third habeas petition is a drastic measure, and we have held that \nit is particu lady egregious to enter a stay absent substantial grounds for \nrelief. \nId. at 346 (citations and quotation marks omitted).  This standard, developed in a \ncapital habeas appeal context, similarly applies with stays issued in a civil rights \nlitigation.  Gomez v. United States District Court, 503 U.S. 653, 653·54 (1992).  In \nlight of this standard of review, this Court should vacate its stay in this case and \npermit Taylor's execution to go forward. \nReview of the Judement.  Regardless of whether this case retains its identity \nas a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or it has been transfonned into a habeas action, see \nNelson v.  Campbell, 124 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2004), the district court orderrejecting \n-3-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:35  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.05 \nTaylor's claims should be affirmed. Ift his case has changed into a habeas action, the \nrejection of Taylor's claims is appropriate because he never obtained approval to \nproceed from this Court as required by  28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3) (before a second or \nsuccessive application for habeas relidis filed in the district court, the applicant must \nobtain authorization to do so from the Court of Appeals). \nIf this  case really does  remain one under §  1983, then the district court's \njudgment  should also be affirmed because that court's well-supported findings of \n.f act and its cogent application of the law to those facts.  On review of a bench trial, \nthe appellate court reviews the trial court's findings of fact for clear error and its \nconclusions oflaw de novo.  Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass'n Bd. v. St. Louis Housing \nAuth., 339 F.3d 702, 710-11 (8'h Cir. 2003).  Additionally, a well-reasoned opinion \nof the district court may be summarily affirmed.  Lashley v. Delo, 997 F.2d 512 (8th \nCir. 1993) (citing 8'h Circuit Local Rule 47B). \nARGUMENT \n. \n' \n\"  'J \nThe district court's January 31,2006 order concluded that Taylor's execution \nwould not violate his Eighth, Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendment rights (Order, p. \n9).  In particular, as to the three drug sequence, the district court found that Taylor \nwould not be conscious after receiving a 5 gram dose of sodium pentothal, the first \ndrug (Order, p. 5; Defendants' Trial Exhibits 1, 3, 4, and 5 (all these exhibits were \nincluded in Exhibit E to the Application for Vacation of District Court's Order \n-4-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:36  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.06 \nProhibiting Execution, filed by the Prison Officials with this Court in Case No. 06-\n1278WMJC on January 20,2006».  This finding, was based on testimony by Dr. \nDershwitz (Order, p. 3, 5).  In fact, Taylor's experts testified that 5 gram dose was \nitself lethal  over a period of two  to  twenty minutes  (Order, p.  4).  Relying  on \ndecisions from around the country and Missouri, the district court properly concluded \nthere would be no Eighth Amendment violation.  Similarly, administering the drugs \nthrough the femoral vein would result in \"little if any pain\" (Order, pp. 6-7).  As the \ndistrict court found, \"an injection is administered to numb the area before a catheter \nis inserted so that the inmate will experience little if any pain (Order, pp. 6-7).  The \ncourt  also  reached  the  correct  legal  conclusion  that  the  small  possibility  of \ncomplications in the procedure does not open it to valid challenge under the Eighth \nAmendment (Order, pp. 5 & 9) (citing Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976); \nLouisiana ex rei. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947); Campbell v.  Wood, \n18 F.3d 662,687 (9I1l Cit. 1994». \nAs to the due process claim, the district court concluded it was meritless.  The \ndistrict court concluded that a physician's participation in the execution process does \nnot violate the physician's code of ethics and does not violate a condemned prisoner's \ndue process rights (Order, pp. 7 &  9).  The court supported this conclusion both \nlogically and on the basis of the existing case law on this point (Order, p. 7) (citing \nAbdur 'Rahman v. Bredesen, No. M2003-0 I 767-COA-R3-CV, 2004 WL 2246227, *9 \n-5-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:36  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.07 \n(Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2004), ajJ'd, 2005 WL2615801 (Tenn. Oct 17,2005).  , \n, \"  , \nSimilarly, the district court found the Thirteenth Amendment claim was meritless \nas a matter ofhiw because the amendment expressly excepts those being punished for \na crime and because Taylor failed to show how prisoners of different races are treated \ndifferently (Order, p. 8)(citing Wendt v. Lynaugh, 841 F.2d 619,620 (5th Cir. 1988); \nDraper v, Rhay, 315 F.2d 193, 197 (9th Cif. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 915, 84 S. \nCt. 214 (1963). \nContrary to Taylor's assertion, there is no \"rush\" to execution here.  He has had \nample time and ability (and has made good use of it) to pursue his claims since his \nconviction.  His opportunities to address his claims in this case with regard to the \nconstitutionality of Missouri 's lethal injection procedure are no different.  Despite a \nfair opportunity to litigate the matter, the district court here correctly concluded that \nMissouri's  lethal  injection procedure  is  constitutional  (Order,  p.  9).  See  also \nJohnston v. Crawford, No. 4:04-CV -1075 CAS, slip op. at pp. 9-10 (E.D. Mo. August \n26,2005); Johnston v. Roper, 421 F.3d 1152 (8th Cir. 2005) (en bane) (review and \ndenial of Johnston's motion for stay of execution).  Recognition of the invalidity of \nTaylor's claims by the district court after conducting its own hearing and independent \nreview on the question does not constitute undue haste. \nTaylor's protestations oflack offair notice to prepare his case before the hearing \ndo not take note of his own failure to file a motion for any sort of equitable relief \n-6-\nI' \n\nFEB-01-2006  15:36  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.08 \nregarding his impending execution until more than two weeks after his execution date \nhad been set or his failure to seek a ruling from the court on the merits of his claims. \nHis suit has been on file since June 2005.  He had over six months to prepare for the \nhearing he sought and which he knew would need to occur before his expected \nexecution.  He also had nearly a month after the issuance ofthe execution warrant in \nthis case to prepare his case.  This preparation could easily have included the taking \nof discovery and preservation depositions. \nIn  particular, Taylor complains of an inability to present evidence from Dr. Sri \nMelethil, a phannacokineticist.  But he never addresses his access to Dr. Melethil \nbefore January 31, 2006, and admits that this doctor had returned from \"out of town\" \nby the morning ofJanuary 31. Thus, Taylor could have called this doctor because the \nhearing in this case reconvened at 9:30 a.m. and continued until nearly noon. Taylor \nasserts, however, that he was still unable to provide the doctor with data from the \ndefense expert, Dr. Mark Dershwitz.  Aside from noting again that Taylor had more \nthan six months to conduct discovery in this case, Taylor also had knowledge that Dr. \nDershwitz would be the defense expert from early in this suit and had a copy of Dr. \nOershwitz's affidavit from the Johnston case reporting his opinion of Missouri's \nlethal  injection  procedure  (and  likely also  had  a transcript of Dr.  Oershwitz's \ntestimony from the Johnston case).  Leaving these opportunities aside, Taylor also \nmade no  apparent attempt to call Dr.  Melethil to testify even to the simple and \n-7-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:37  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.09 \nstraight forward proposition, as expressed in Taylor's brief, that Dr. Dershwitz's \nanalysis was allegedly flawed because his conclusions were based on drug levels in \nthe blood instead of drug levels in the brain. \nHaving passed on the opportunities to develop his case, Taylor's complaints now \nabout lack of a full opportunity to provide relevant evidence are not compelling. \nEven if the declaration of Dr. Melethil that has been presented to the Prison \nOfficials this morning could be taken into account in the review of the district court's \norder, it shows that evidence from this doctor would have added little to the trial \nanyway and does not call the district court's judgment into doubt.l  The district court \nfound  the 5 gram dose of sodium pentothal sufficient to render the condemned \nunconscious, based on the testimony of Dr. Dershwitz (Order, pp. 3, 5; Defendants' \nTrial Exhibits  1, 3, 4, and 5 (all these exhibits were included in Exhibit E to the \nApplication for Vacation ofD  istrict Court's Order Prohibiting Execution, filed by the \nPrison Officials with this Court in Case No. 06-1278WMJC on January 20,2006)). \nDr.  Melethil's speculation in the declaration, based on animal studies and lower \ndosages, does not demonstrate the wanton infliction of pain during the execution. \nThat is true especially because he does not contradict the evidence that the dose of \nthiopental sodium at issue here is not a marginal one, but one that even Taylor's \nIn fact, the Declaration shows that another lawyer who had been working on \nI \nthis case with Taylor's counsel (counsel to former co-plaintiff Richard D. Clay) has \nbeen in contact with Dr. Melethil since mid-September. \n-8-\n\nFEB-Ol-2006  15:37  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.l0 \ntestifying experts state was itself lethal (see Order, p. 4). \nTaylor's related claim, that he was denied a fair opportunity to make his case at \nthe district court hearing because he was not permitted to call the doctor and nurse \nwho are present at Missouri's executions is also unavailing.  Testimony from these \nwitnesses  would be of little relevance.  The challenge here is to the method of \nexecution.  Taylor has been given detailed information as to the drugs used, their \ndoses, and the order and the manner of administration.  That method is what it is \nregardless of who prepares the drugs and sets the IV. \nTaylor's contention that the testimony of these witnesses is relevant for their \nobservations at executions is also of no avail because there are other witnesses to \nexecutions who could provide such testimony - and he does not claim to have made \nany effort to obtain such testimony. \nWhile the qualifications ofthe doctor and nurse may have some relevance, the \ndistrict  court  has  assessed  Taylor's  need  for  information  on  qualifications  of \npersonnel involved in the process and instructed petitioner to provide Taylor with the \nnecessary relevant information. Pursuant to this instruction petitioners have provided \nto Taylor background facts including that the doctorinvolved in Missouri executions \nis a licensed physician and a board-certified surgeon and that the nurse is a licensed \npractical nurse. \nThe district court's decision with regard to information about and testimony from \n-9-\n\nFEB-01-2006  15:37  ATT  GENERAL  573 751  3825  P.ll \nthe doctor and nurse struck the proper balance between Taylor's need for infonnation \nand the Prison Officials' (and the doctor's) concern that identifying the doctor and \nnurse would result in their safety and security being put at risk from strident  death \npenalty opponents. \nThe district court's decisions as  the challenged evidentiary matters were very \nto \nreasonable and cannot be disturbed as an abuse of discretion. \nThere was more than sufficient evidence to support the district court judgment \nas outlined above and as contained in Exhibit E (containing Defendants' trial exhibits \n1,3,4, and 5) before the district court).  The Court should decline Taylor's invitation \nto reweigh the evidence. \nWHEREFORE, the Prison Officials pray this court to deny Taylor's request for \na stay and to summarily affirm the district court's well-reasoned decision. \n,I,' \n~ : \n-\\0-\n.• !, \n\nFEB-01-2006  15:37  ATT  GENERAL  573751  3825  P.12 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJEREMIAH w.

The Court has reviewed the Proposed Initial\nDiscovery List and now issues the following order. \nThe Eighth Circuit in its April 27, 2006, Order stated that it was remanding the\ncase for the limited purpose of permitting a continuation of the hearing held on January\n30-31, 2006.  The Court stated that “[w]hile we conclude that some further opportunity\nfor discovery may be warranted, we leave all matters of what further discovery may be\nwarranted to Judge Gaitan. . . ”  Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-1397, 2006 WL 1098173, *4\n(8th Cir. Apr. 27, 2006).  In reviewing the proposed list of initial discovery it appears that \nplaintiff is attempting to begin discovery anew.  The Court is not inclined to allow this. \nThe Eighth Circuit remanded this case for a continuation of the previous hearing that\nwas begun in January, not for an entirely new hearing.  The Court will not allow plaintiff\nto recall witnesses who have already testified, unless there is new information which the\nwitnesses have to offer that was not previously available.  \nWith regard to the depositions requested, the Court will allow only a limited\ndeposition of Mr. Crawford. The Court sees no need for any other depositions.  As to\nthe document requests, the Court will allow the following requests: 1) Any records or\ndocuments available which pertain to any of the last six executions carried out by the\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 97     Filed 05/02/2006     Page 2 of 2(cid:10)\nState of Missouri.  This would include any execution logs, records, autopsy reports, test\nresults and analyses of post-mortem/toxicology reports.  2) The State shall also provide\ninformation regarding what specialized training the physicians and nurses undergo who\nparticipate in administration of  the drugs and all documents pertaining to any fall back\nprocedures regarding vein access and the three drug sequence. \nThe parties shall be prepared to discuss with the Court during the 1:30 p.m.\nconference scheduled for May 2, 2006, a timetable to complete the discovery which the\nCourt has allowed.  The parties should note that all discovery is subject to the time\nlimitations imposed by the Eighth Circuit and must be completed within thirty days from\nthe date of the Eighth Circuit’s opinion.\n   \nDate: May 2, 2006             S/ FERNANDO J.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI \nCENTRAL DIVISION \n \n \nMICHAEL ANTHONY TAYLOR   ) \n) \nPlaintiff,     ) \nvs.           )   No. 05-4173-CV-W-FJG \n) \nLARRY CRAWFORD, et al.,   ) \n) \nDefendants.     ) \n______________________________) \n \n \n \nMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION PURSUANT TO  \nFEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 60  \n \nPlaintiff Taylor respectfully asks this Court to reconsider its order of May 2, 2006 \n(“Order”) severely limiting the scope of discovery in this case.  By denying Plaintiff even the \nopportunity to present argument in favor of allowing most forms of discovery, this Court has \nacted inconsistently with the unanimous opinion of the Eighth Circuit, and the 9-1 vote of that \nCourt sitting on en banc.  Because the Eighth Circuit’s opinion concluded that the previous \nhearing-- through no fault of this Court-- was infected with due process error, it would be an \nabuse of discretion to hold a new hearing on remand that does not correct the error found by the \nappellate court.  Plaintiff is fully committed to litigating his case in a timely manner in \naccordance with the schedule ordered by the Eighth Circuit.  But at the same time, Plaintiff is \nentitled not to be held to the limited body of evidence that the Eighth Circuit found \nconstitutionally inadequate.   The Court’s Order all but shuts the 30-day window of discovery \nthat the Eighth Circuit has ruled be open.   \n \n\nI.  THE COURT’S ORDER IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE EIGHTH \nCIRCUIT’S OPINION.   \n \nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion (“Opinion”) makes clear that the prior hearing before this \nCourt was constitutionally inadequate as a result of timetable imposed by the appellate court.  In \nunmistakable language, the Eighth Circuit offered its “mea culpa” for denying Plaintiff the \nopportunity to “make the record he felt necessary for the full and fair consideration of the merits \nof the case.”  Opinion at 6.  The panel recognized that it “asked the district court and the parties \nto do too much in too little time” and that it was appropriate to “expand or supplement the \nrecord.”  Id.  It also noted the 9-1 vote of the en banc Court to grant a stay, and on that basis \nremanded the case back to this Court for a “continuation of the hearing.” Id. at 7.  The appellate \ncourt further found that “some further opportunity for discovery may be warranted” and \ncommitted the choice of discovery to this Court.  Id.   \nThe Court’s Order is fundamentally inconsistent with the Eighth Circuit’s opinion.  First, \nthe order bars witnesses who have already testified from testifying further.  This ruling cannot be \nreconciled with the Eighth Circuit’s holding that the hearing in which those witnesses testified \nwas constitutionally defective.   The Eighth Circuit’s recognition that short-notice hearing \nimposed a “burdensome strain” necessitates that Plaintiff should not be held to the affirmative \ncase and cross-examination that Plaintiff’s counsel was able to prepare on just a few hours \nnotice.  Instead, Plaintiff should be entitled, consistent with the new time frame imposed by the \nEighth Circuit and the normal rules of evidence, to present whatever witnesses and evidence he \nbelieves relevant to support his case.  This is not asking for an entirely new hearing, but rather \nthe opportunity, consistent with the Eighth Circuit’s instructions, to “expand or supplement the \n2 \n \n\nrecord” with any additional evidence that may shed light on the legal issues at stake here.1    \nUnder the Eighth Circuit’s order, it is an abuse of discretion to preserve the flawed evidence of \nthat proceeding rather than allow Plaintiff, who now has adequate time to present his case, to \nrevisit those issues as appropriate.   \nSecond, the Court’s order does not carry out the Eighth Circuit’s instructions regarding \ndiscovery.  The Opinion is extremely clear that additional discovery may be warranted and that \nthis Court should use its discretion in deciding what discovery is open to the parties.  This Court \ncould not have exercised its discretion soundly by ruling on all the discovery issues before it \nbefore Plaintiff has had any opportunity to argue why its proposed discovery is relevant.  For \nexample, although the Court has stated that it “sees no need for any other depositions” beyond a \nlimited deposition of Mr. Crawford, Plaintiff has not even had the opportunity to present its \nreasons.  Indeed, the Court’s order denies access to discovery that the State has agreed to, such as \nthe deposition of the State’s primary expert, Dr. Dershwitz.  Similarly, the Court has limited the \nscope of document requests to the past six executions, without allowing argument by Plaintiff as \nto relevance of going beyond the State’s chosen scope of discovery.  In short, it would be an \nabuse of discretion within the terms of the Eighth Circuit’s order to peremptorily cut off critical \navenues of discovery during the very period in which the appellate court has asked this court to \nconsider Plaintiff’s requests.   \nII.  THE DISCOVERY DENIED BY THE COURT’S ORDER IS HIGHLY \nRELEVANT AND SO CENTRAL TO THE MERITS OF THIS CASE \nTHAT THE DENIAL VIOLATES DUE PROCESS. \n   \n                                                 \n1 The Order’s proviso that witnesses may be recalled to testify regarding “previously \nunavailable” information is far too narrow to rectify the constitutional flaws of the prior \nproceeding.  For example, although Plaintiff was able to obtain some information in discovery \nprior to the first hearing, counsel was unable to prepare an effective presentation of that \ninformation in light of the “burdensome strain” of timing that hearing imposed. \n3 \n \n\nIf this Court were to consider the merits of Plaintiff’s requests for discovery, it would \nfind them compelling.   The State objects to Plaintiff’s requested deposition of John Doe 1, the \ndoctor who assists with executions.  This deposition is crucial to determining the merits of Mr. \nTaylor’s claims.  Plaintiff understands that John Doe 1 inserts the catheter into the femoral vein \nof the inmate to be executed.  Part of Plaintiff’s claim is that this unnecessary, painful femoral \nline procedure itself violates the Eighth Amendment.  Femoral vein access is an extremely risky \nprocedure that is rarely used in the medical context except in extraordinary circumstances.  It is \ntherefore far from a routine procedure, and it poses, among other problems, serious risk of \ninfection.  This risk is particularly troubling given that some inmates scheduled to be executed \nreceive last minute stays that halt an execution after the inmate’s veins have been accessed.2  \n(Along similar lines, a deposition would be essential in determining what steps are taken by John \nDoe 1 and the other people involved if there is in fact a last minute stay.)   \n  It is also essential to know the qualifications of the doctor inserting the line.  Because \nfemoral lines are rarely used in medicine, many doctors have little or no experience inserting \nthem.  Similarly, because complications often arise during femoral line procedures, only doctors \nperforming such procedures with some regularity would be equipped to deal with such \ncomplications.  Determining John Doe 1’s qualifications and experience in this regard -- which \ncould not be done without deposing him -- is a crucial component of evaluating the State’s use of \nthe femoral line.  Additionally, because sodium pentothal only works as an anesthetic if it is \nproperly administered, it is essential to know how the femoral vein is accessed by Missouri.  Any \nerrors arising from femoral access could lead to improper administration of the three chemicals.  \nSuch errors would therefore not only amount to Eighth Amendment violations in their own right \n                                                 \n2 The State of Florida, for instance, had already strapped down Mr. Hill and accessed his veins \nwhen he received a last-minute stay halting his execution.   \n4 \n \n\n(due to the painful and humiliating femoral vein access) but also result in improper \nadministration of the chemicals, thus leading to additional Eighth Amendment violations.  Only \nby talking to the person who actually performs this procedure could Plaintiff gather the relevant \ninformation on this issue.3   \n  On a related note, it would also be crucial to determine whether John Doe 1 (or any other \ndoctor participating in the procedure) is an anesthesiologist trained to monitor anesthetic depth.  \nAs alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint, if the first chemical, sodium pentothal, fails to anesthetize \nthe inmate properly, he will suffer excruciating pain as a result of the other two chemicals.  But \nonly an anesthesiologist is properly trained and qualified to monitor such depths.  Deposing John \nDoe 1 would give Plaintiff the necessary opportunity to determine whether he has the necessary \ntraining to monitor anesthetic depths at all and whether his position in the execution room \nrelative to the inmate affords him a proper view to do so.   \n  Just as a deposition of the doctor (John Doe 1) would yield information absolutely central \nto this case and unobtainable in any other form, so too would depositions of the other John Does \n(John Does 2-6) yield similarly critical information.  The nurse (John Doe 2) might, for instance, \nmix the chemicals used in the process.  Her qualifications and experience are therefore of great \nsignificance, as is a detailed account of the exact steps she takes during every execution.  \nSimilarly, the “plunger” who actually pushes the syringe (John Doe 3) is a vital person on the \nexecution team whose first hand knowledge of the lethal injection procedures is central to this \ncase.  Once again, this person’s experience and qualifications are important, since an unqualified \n                                                 \n3 Indeed, because Missouri has failed to provide any published protocol, there exists no way for \nPlaintiff to access this information, other than by deposition.  But even if Missouri’s procedure \nfor accessing the femoral vein were published, a deposition of John Doe 1 would be necessary to \nsee how the procedure actually is performed by the person who performs it.  All other \ninformation would merely describe how the State says its executions should proceed, but would \ngive no insight into what actually is happening.   \n5 \n \n\nperson could administer the chemicals improperly, potentially resulting in any of a number of \nerrors, including a broken syringe.  It would also be important to know exactly how John Doe 3 \ncarries out his duties during each execution.  And, as for John Doe 4, he is believed to be the \nonly person in the room during the execution.  Clearly, he would have knowledge and \nunderstanding of how the procedure is actually carried out that nobody else would have and that \nwould not be obtainable from the State in any other way.  And any other people involved in the \nexecution procedure (John Does 5-6) would obviously also have firsthand knowledge crucial to \nthis case.  Plaintiff therefore asserts that the State’s contention that these depositions would not \nlead to relevant evidence could not be further from the truth.   \n  The State also contends that providing the identities of the persons involved in carrying \nout executions will impinge on the security interests of these persons and of the prison, and of \nthe privacy interests of these persons.  Plaintiff fully understands that any information revealing \nor reasonably leading to the discovery of the identity of any or all of these persons will be subject \nto a protective order crafted by this Court.  Plaintiff’s counsel represents that it will abide by the \nterms of such a protective order.  Given that these depositions are central to the Plaintiff’s case \nand that the State’s security and privacy concerns could easily be protected by a protective order, \nthe State’s objections on this ground do not justify a decision so drastic as denying Plaintiff \naccess to key information upon which this case turns.  Accordingly, Plaintiff represents that due \nto the protective order, disclosure will not hamper the ability of the State to find personnel to \ncarry out its executions.   \nThe State’s entire case turns on the accuracy and credibility of Dr. Dershwitz’s testimony \non the effectiveness of the State’s procedures in preventing unconstitutional pain.  For this \nreason, it is essential that Mr. Taylor depose Dr. Dershwitz.  The constitutionally inadequate \n6 \n \n\nhearing did not provide Mr. Taylor with a proper opportunity to cross examination the State’s \nmedical expert.  It was impossible for Mr. Taylor’s counsel to prepare for Dershwitz’s nuanced \ntestimony on the several hours’ notice that he received.  At a minimum, Dr. Dershwitz must be \ndeposed because his scientific conclusions and the graphs on which they are based have never \nbeen publicly challenged, and the assumptions underlying Dr. Dershwitz’s evidence are \nfundamentally flawed.  Even Dr. Dershwitz’s definition of unconsciousness, for example, is \ninconsistent with how the term is understood in the medical community.  In addition, the State \nitself has already agreed to the deposition of Mr. Dershwitz.  \n  It also is essential that Mr. Taylor receive any records of the State’s past executions \ndating back to 1989.  Dr. Dershwitz has previously made two critical assertions, both of which \nhave been belied in other States by precisely the evidence that Mr. Taylor seeks here.  First, \nDershwitz has alleged that the inmate will stop breathing within one minute of the administration \nof thiopental.  Second, he has testified that death results within one minute of the administration \nof potassium chloride.  We now know these allegations to be incorrect.  See, e.g., Morales v. \nHickman, No. C-06-219-JF, --F.Supp.2d--, 2006 WL 335427, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2006), \naff’d, No. 06-99002, --F.3d--, 2006 WL 391604 (9th Cir. Feb. 19, 2006) (per curiam), cert. \ndenied, No. 05-9291, 2006 WL 386765 (U.S. Feb. 20, 2006); Brown v. Beck, No. 5:06-CT-3018-\nH (April 7, 2006, E.D. N. Car.).  There are reasons to believe that the same evidence is available \nin Missouri.  For example, the complications in Leroy Hunter’s execution by lethal injection, \nwhich took place in 2000, are notorious, but the State has refused to provide any documentation \nregarding lethal injections dating back even six years to that execution.   Moreover, it is critical \nto discover the changes made in the lethal injection procedures (in terms of dosage, saline \nflushes, ordering of the chemicals, IV access, length of tubing, time between femoral placement \n7 \n \n\nand administration of chemicals, etc.) in order to determine the types of complications inherent \nin the current procedure and whether the State is acting with the necessary level of deliberate \ncare.  This in no fishing expedition.  Mr. Taylor’s document requests are narrowly tailored to \nprovide critical information through a narrow set of documents pertaining only to 66 executions.    \nAt a minimum, Mr. Taylor requests that the Court reconsider granting his document \nrequests for executions dating back to January 1, 1995.  On information and belief, the State \nstopped using the Leuchter machine for administering lethal injections around this time. For this \nreason, the decisions made in 1995 and going forward are especially relevant to the procedures \nused today.  Any changes in the procedures and the executions that precipitated those changes \nare of course relevant as they shed light on the problems that arose in prior executions and the \ndegree to which the State’s actions were responsive to those known inadequacies in its \nprocedures.  \n*** \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff asks that this Court reconsider its Order.  If the Court \ngrants the motion, Plaintiff requests that the Court schedule a conference on Wednesday, May 3. \n2006 to determine the proper scope of discovery.  In the event that the Court will not reconsider \nits Order, Plaintiff will seek immediate review of the order in the Eighth Circuit under that \ncourt’s retained appellate jurisdiction.   \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n \n8 \n \n\n/s/ JOHN WILLIAM SIMON           /s DONALD B.

All right.  Ready to  \n \n           3    begin? \n \n           4              MR. HELLMAN:  Yes, Your Honor. \n \n           5              THE COURT:  How about some introductions first. \n \n           6              MR. HELLMAN:  Absolutely.  I am Matthew Hellman  \n \n           7    for plaintiff Taylor.   \n \n           8              MR. SIMON:  John William Simon for plaintiff.  \n \n           9              MR.

All right.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 4of 125\n \n          12    Let's begin. \n \n          13              As I previously indicated, no opening statements  \n \n          14    would be necessary.  Your pretrial briefs were very  \n \n          15    informative and I think we ought to use our time wisely and  \n \n          16    proceed. \n \n          17              MR. HELLMAN:  In that spirit then, Your Honor,  \n \n          18    plaintiff would just like to note for the record that  \n \n          19    although plaintiff had said in its pretrial brief that we  \n \n          20    would have seven witnesses available for the hearing today  \n \n          21    to testify, three expert witnesses and four of the party  \n \n          22    defendants, John Does One, Two, Three and Five.  Despite  \n \n          23    our best efforts we have been unable to secure the presence  \n \n          24    of the Doe defendants.  We have, because we don't know  \n \n          25    their names and have not tried to obtain their names, we  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               3 \n \n \n \n           1    asked if we could serve their counsel, Mr. Pritchett, and  \n \n           2    pass on service to them.  Counsel refused.  And although we  \n \n           3    tried to effect service, service was refused. \n \n           4              Similarly, we attempted service on Director  \n \n           5    Crawford who is their employer and we thought that would be  \n \n           6    an appropriate person in this circumstance.  Service was  \n \n           7    also refused there. \n \n           8              So we have been unable to secure their attendance  \n \n           9    and we believe it's inappropriate that these party  \n \n          10    defendants are not here.  Opposing counsel is free to quash  \n \n          11    the subpoena, but -- or move to do so.  But short of that,  \n \n          12    we believe service would be appropriate on them.  We ask  \n \n          13    the court to rule as such. \n \n          14              THE COURT:  Response? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 5of 125\n \n          15              MR. PRITCHETT:  As I think was admitted, there  \n \n          16    was no service.  Even if there had been service on either  \n \n          17    myself or on Mr. Crawford, it still would have been  \n \n          18    inappropriate and invalid service because service of  \n \n          19    subpoenas must be made on individuals.   \n \n          20              Additionally, in terms of whether or not the  \n \n          21    subpoena should be quashed even if it had been served, we  \n \n          22    have noted several times during the course of this  \n \n          23    litigation the importance of maintaining the  \n \n          24    confidentiality, the privacy of the John Does, and we  \n \n          25    believe that interest outweighs any need for the testimony  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               4 \n \n \n \n           1    of those individuals, especially given the written  \n \n           2    interrogatory responses from all of the Does, as well as  \n \n           3    the deposition of Dr. John Doe One. \n \n           4              THE COURT:  Okay.  I agree with the latter.   \n \n           5    Let's proceed. \n \n           6              MR. HELLMAN:  And one final point, Your Honor.   \n \n           7    We understand that one of the defendants is in the  \n \n           8    courtroom today and we would invoke the rule against  \n \n           9    witnesses and ask that he not be present when our witnesses  \n \n          10    testify. \n \n          11              THE COURT:  Who would that be? \n \n          12              MR. PRITCHETT:  Mr. Crawford is a defendant in  \n \n          13    this case and I think as a defendant Mr. Crawford is  \n \n          14    entitled to be present during the testimony. \n \n          15              THE COURT:  Is that who you are speaking of? \n \n          16              MR. HELLMAN:  Yes, I am. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  Objection is overruled. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 6of 125\n \n          18              MR. PRITCHETT:  I will note for full disclosure,  \n \n          19    since the idea has been brought up, Terry Moore, director  \n \n          20    of the Division of Adult Institutions, who is not a  \n \n          21    defendant, is in the courtroom and if the rule as to  \n \n          22    witnesses is invoked we would ask that the expert  \n \n          23    witnesses, other than the ones testifying, be excluded as  \n \n          24    well. \n \n          25              MR. HELLMAN:  It's my understanding that the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               5 \n \n \n \n           1    rule of exclusion does not apply to expert witnesses who  \n \n           2    are always able to hear all testimony whether expert or  \n \n           3    otherwise, but it does apply as a matter of course to a  \n \n           4    testifying defendant. \n \n           5              THE COURT:  I think it's at the discretion of the  \n \n           6    court and it's the court's discretion that any witness that  \n \n           7    will be testifying will be excluded.  Defendant's  \n \n           8    representative is entitled to be here and otherwise any  \n \n           9    other -- if you're invoking the rule, that's the way the  \n \n          10    rule is going to be applied.  Is that your request? \n \n          11              MR. HELLMAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Are you  \n \n          12    saying that the defendant's witnesses may stay, but our  \n \n          13    experts may not? \n \n          14              THE COURT:  No, I said the defendant's  \n \n          15    representative, Mr. Crawford, who is a party in the case,   \n \n          16    he's entitled to be in this proceeding.  All other  \n \n          17    witnesses will be excluded. \n \n          18              MR. HELLMAN:  Expert or otherwise? \n \n          19              THE COURT:  That's what I said. \n \n          20              MR.

You're  \n \n          23    wasting time.  Let's move. \n \n          24              MR. HELLMAN:  All right.  Thank you, Your Honor.   \n \n          25              THE COURT:  If you're an expert and you're going  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               6 \n \n \n \n           1    to be testifying, it's time to step out of the courtroom,  \n \n           2    and any other witnesses. \n \n           3              MS. ANDERS:  As a preliminary matter, Your Honor,  \n \n           4    before we call our first witness, plaintiff would like to  \n \n           5    admit a bunch of exhibits just up front, if that would  \n \n           6    be -- \n \n           7              THE COURT:  Is this by stipulation?  \n \n           8              MS. ANDERS:  I understand the defendants have  \n \n           9    stipulated to the authenticity, or will stipulate to the  \n \n          10    authenticity of the interrogatory responses of the Doe  \n \n          11    defendants and the document of the execution records  \n \n          12    received in discovery. \n \n          13              MR. PRITCHETT:  That's correct, Your Honor,  \n \n          14    that we have agreed to stipulate to the authenticity of  \n \n          15    interrogatory responses and of the execution records that  \n \n          16    have been supplied by the State.  I was reserving consent  \n \n          17    and stipulation to the merits, the relevance of them.  I  \n \n          18    think I will withdraw that, but I would like to see  \n \n          19    specifically what they are before I would do that.   \n \n          20              The interrogatory answers, I know what those  \n \n          21    are.

ANDERS:  It is everything that you supplied  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 8of 125\n \n          24    us. \n \n          25              MR.

If we supplied it as part  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               7 \n \n \n \n           1    of our discovery, we will stipulate to that. \n \n           2              Is there anything else other than those  \n \n           3    documents?  \n \n           4              MS. ANDERS:  There's also the answer of John Doe  \n \n           5    One in response to the court's interrogatories. \n \n           6              MR. PRITCHETT:  We would stipulate to that.   \n \n           7              MS. ANDERS:  And the deposition transcript, the  \n \n           8    deposition of John Doe One.  This is the unredacted  \n \n           9    version. \n \n          10              MR. PRITCHETT:  We'll stipulate to the admission  \n \n          11    and use of the deposition of John Doe One.  There is  \n \n          12    identifying information.  There is a redacted version as  \n \n          13    well.  We, of course, think the court would be able to use  \n \n          14    it for any purpose it wants.  We would not like the  \n \n          15    nonredacted version to be part of the public record.  We  \n \n          16    would like it to be under seal. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  Is that agreed by agreement?  \n \n          18              MS. ANDERS:  That would be fine, Your Honor.   \n \n          19    There are a couple of quotations in the transcript on which  \n \n          20    we don't agree, we weren't able to agree on. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  You don't agree that they're  \n \n          22    identifying testimony, is that what you're saying? \n \n          23              MS. ANDERS:  There is one portion which we do not  \n \n          24    agree subject to a protective order.  I don't think you've  \n \n          25    ruled on that, but everything else can be agreed to. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                               8 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 9of 125\n \n \n \n           1              THE COURT:  All right.  With regard to the part  \n \n           2    that's in dispute we'll take up subsequent to this hearing  \n \n           3    in terms of whether it's subject to disclosure or not. \n \n           4              MS. ANDERS:  So we should admit the  \n \n           5    unredacted -- \n \n           6              THE COURT:  Subject to -- and, you know, it would  \n \n           7    be nice to have all the exhibits stipulated to and we  \n \n           8    wouldn't have to waste the time this morning doing that.   \n \n           9    Maybe the way to do that is assume it's stipulated to  \n \n          10    unless some objection is raised to the contrary.  Okay? \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you, Your Honor.   \n \n          12              MR. PRITCHETT:  May I ask if there is a set of  \n \n          13    the exhibits that are marked so it will be easier for us to  \n \n          14    follow?  \n \n          15              MS. ANDERS:  Yes, we have a set that we're going  \n \n          16    to have admitted as exhibits. \n \n          17              MR. PRITCHETT:  As we go along?  Okay.  \n \n          18              MS. ANDERS:  And, Your Honor, would you like to  \n \n          19    place the unredacted version of the John Doe One transcript  \n \n          20    in your binder? \n \n          21              THE COURT:  That's fine.  I was part of the  \n \n          22    deposition so I really don't require one I don't think.   \n \n          23    At this time anyway.  And I think we have a copy, not the  \n \n          24    redacted copy, but -- \n \n          25              MS.

I have attended hearings where participants in  \n \n          22    lethal injection procedures have testified.  I have read  \n \n          23    depositions that they have provided.  I have reviewed  \n \n          24    hundreds of autopsy reports from lethal injection  \n \n          25    procedures.  Many toxicology reports.  I have inspected the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              11 \n \n \n \n           1    facilities that -- the chambers, the work rooms where  \n \n           2    lethal injection is conducted from.  I have corresponded  \n \n           3    with the individuals who initially created the first lethal  \n \n           4    injection protocols. \n \n           5    Q    And so as part of that research, you have reviewed in  \n \n           6    detail other states' lethal injection protocol? \n \n           7    A    I have, yes. \n \n           8    Q    And are you familiar basically with other states'  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 12of 125\n \n           9    practices with respect to safety? \n \n          10    A    I am, yes. \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, we'd like to offer  \n \n          12    Dr. Heath as an expert in anesthesiology and medicine and  \n \n          13    lethal injection procedures.  \n \n          14              MR. HAWKE:  No objection, Your Honor. \n \n          15    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  When did you begin participating in  \n \n          16    lethal injection litigation? \n \n          17    A    I think it was in 2002. \n \n          18    Q    At that time did you have a position on the death  \n \n          19    penalty? \n \n          20    A    I did not at that time, no. \n \n          21    Q    Do you have a position on the death penalty now? \n \n          22    A    I do, yes. \n \n          23    Q    And what is that? \n \n          24    A    I think it's very problematic to try to arrive at the  \n \n          25    decision as to whether or not to execute a person based on  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              12 \n \n \n \n           1    an adversarial process. \n \n           2    Q    Do you think that lethal injection can be performed  \n \n           3    humanely? \n \n           4    A    Yes, it can. \n \n           5    Q    Could you explain your view on that? \n \n           6    A    Well, many household pets, cats and dogs, are given  \n \n           7    lethal injection as part of what we call euthanasia or  \n \n           8    putting an animal to sleep and that's done by qualified  \n \n           9    veterinarians using appropriate drugs.  It's done routinely  \n \n          10    thousands of times a day in our country.  And I am very  \n \n          11    confident that the fashion in which it's being performed is  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 13of 125\n \n          12    a humane process. \n \n          13    Q    Why did you agree to testify in this case? \n \n          14    A    One of the big problems is that the methods that are  \n \n          15    being used for lethal injection in Missouri and some other  \n \n          16    states conflicts with how it's being done for animals, with  \n \n          17    the humane method that is being used for animals, is being  \n \n          18    done in a completely different method that poses enormous  \n \n          19    and unacceptable risks. \n \n          20    Q    And have you reviewed the documents produced in  \n \n          21    discovery by the defendants in this case? \n \n          22    A    I have, yes. \n \n          23    Q    Specifically, have you reviewed interrogatory  \n \n          24    responses by the John Doe defendants and defendant  \n \n          25    Crawford? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              13 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I have, yes. \n \n           2    Q    Have you reviewed the deposition testimony of John Doe  \n \n           3    One? \n \n           4    A    Yes. \n \n           5    Q    And did you attend an inspection of the execution  \n \n           6    facility at Bonne Terre, Missouri? \n \n           7    A    I did. \n \n           8    Q    At the inspection did you have the opportunity to  \n \n           9    observe the equipment as it was set up -- as it would be  \n \n          10    set up for an execution, and did you also have the  \n \n          11    opportunity to speak to people there about the equipment? \n \n          12    A    Yes, I did. \n \n          13    Q    I'm going to be asking you questions about some of the  \n \n          14    documents produced by the defendants so I'd just like to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 14of 125\n \n          15    hand you a couple of the exhibits that have already been  \n \n          16    admitted.   \n \n          17              This is a verified record that I'm showing  \n \n          18    opposing counsel of John Doe One's answers to  \n \n          19    interrogatories, all three sets, that's Plaintiff's  \n \n          20    Exhibit 1, 6, and 11, as well as the redacted transcript  \n \n          21    of the John Doe deposition.   \n \n          22              May I approach, Your Honor. \n \n          23              THE COURT:  Okay.  Ms. Anders, when you turn your  \n \n          24    back to the microphone I couldn't hear a word that you  \n \n          25    said.  Which exhibits are you offering? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              14 \n \n \n \n           1              MS. ANDERS:  I would like to hand the witness  \n \n           2    Plaintiff's Exhibits 1, 6, 11 and 12. \n \n           3              THE COURT:  Okay.  You may approach the witness. \n \n           4              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you. \n \n           5    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So, Dr. Heath, based on your review  \n \n           6    of Director Crawford's interrogatory answers, could you  \n \n           7    briefly state your general understanding of the components  \n \n           8    of the execution process in Missouri? \n \n           9    A    Yes.  There are four main stages to it.  The first  \n \n          10    stage is the achieving of the intravenous access.  The  \n \n          11    second stage is the administration of general anesthesia,  \n \n          12    and that's important because the third and fourth stages  \n \n          13    would be extremely painful if that second stage, the  \n \n          14    general anesthesia stage, was not properly performed.  And  \n \n          15    then the third stage is the administration of a paralyzing  \n \n          16    drug that ensures that the procedure appears serene and  \n \n          17    peaceful.  And then the fourth stage is the administration  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 15of 125\n \n          18    of the actual drug that kills the prisoner, stops the  \n \n          19    heart. \n \n          20    Q    And based on your review of the documents, is the  \n \n          21    manner of performing each of these component parts written  \n \n          22    down or formalized anywhere? \n \n          23    A    It's -- no, it's not written down in any documents or  \n \n          24    procedures or policy manuals, if that's what you mean. \n \n          25    Q    Based on what John Doe One has testified to, have  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              15 \n \n \n \n           1    these components varied in previous executions? \n \n           2    A    Yes, there has been variation of each of these four  \n \n           3    stages or components of the execution. \n \n           4    Q    Could you just explain briefly how the stages have  \n \n           5    varied?  \n \n           6    A    Well, that first stage, which is the achieving of the  \n \n           7    intravenous access, in some occasions it's performed with a  \n \n           8    femoral vein access.  In some occasions it's performed in  \n \n           9    what I believe is a subclavian access, under the collarbone  \n \n          10    that's also been described as being in the neck.  And then  \n \n          11    there's also been at least one occasion where it was  \n \n          12    performed through what's called a peripheral IV, which is  \n \n          13    an IV in the hand or arm or the foot.  So that's variations  \n \n          14    in that first stage.   \n \n          15              Then in the second stage, which is the provision  \n \n          16    of the general anesthesia to reach the level of  \n \n          17    unconsciousness, there has been significant variations  \n \n          18    apparently in the doses of the thiopental, the drug that  \n \n          19    provides the anesthesia.  The third stage is the delivery  \n \n          20    of the paralyzing drug, and there appear to have been  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 16of 125\n \n          21    dosing variations in that drug.  And the same applies for  \n \n          22    the fourth stage, the potassium that stops the heart, there  \n \n          23    have been variations for how much of that has been  \n \n          24    administered. \n \n          25    Q    And based on your review of other states' practices  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              16 \n \n \n \n           1    with respect to executions, is it standard in other states  \n \n           2    to provide written guidelines or instructions to be  \n \n           3    followed by the execution team? \n \n           4    A    I wouldn't even call them guidelines.  States have  \n \n           5    what are called protocols.  It's a set of instructions that  \n \n           6    detail the drugs, the doses, the flush solutions, and a  \n \n           7    myriad of other features of the execution procedure.  It's  \n \n           8    a complicated procedure, and those protocols set it forth  \n \n           9    in very clear sequential instructions exactly what the  \n \n          10    personnel need to do.  And that's a standard in other  \n \n          11    states. \n \n          12    Q    And based on your review of other states' procedures,  \n \n          13    do you think that maintaining a written protocol is a  \n \n          14    positive step towards ensuring that an execution is humane? \n \n          15    A    I think it is extremely important.  It's important  \n \n          16    to remember that in most cases the personnel who are  \n \n          17    performing the execution, to our knowledge, are not  \n \n          18    individuals who are familiar with the provision of general  \n \n          19    anesthesia or even the injection of medical drugs or  \n \n          20    setting up IVs, so it's very important that they are given  \n \n          21    very clear and clean, understandable instruction that they  \n \n          22    can follow to ensure that the procedure unfolds as it's  \n \n          23    supposed to. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 17of 125\n \n          24    Q    And to your knowledge, does any other state besides  \n \n          25    Missouri not maintain a written protocol? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              17 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Everywhere else, to my knowledge, has a written  \n \n           2    protocol. \n \n           3    Q    Why do you think it is important to have a written  \n \n           4    protocol? \n \n           5    A    Again, if there's no written protocol, then the  \n \n           6    interests of the State or the Department of Corrections,  \n \n           7    which are to ensure that the prisoner dies humanely, and  \n \n           8    the interest of the prisoner, which at the very least is to  \n \n           9    ensure that what happens to him is humane, are not defended \n \n          10    against ad hoc changes or vagaries or misunderstandings or  \n \n          11    absent-mindedness or other problems that can occur when a  \n \n          12    complex endeavor is undertaken by a group of people. \n \n          13              Protocols are also important because it's very  \n \n          14    important to rehearse these procedures, and the only way  \n \n          15    you can rehearse something is if you have the steps written  \n \n          16    down.  Just like rehearsing a play, you need to have a  \n \n          17    script to rehearse off of.  And if you don't have the  \n \n          18    written procedures there's no way of reliably making sure  \n \n          19    all of these are followed in the rehearsals as well as when  \n \n          20    you actually perform it. \n \n          21    Q    And based on your review of the evidence in this case,  \n \n          22    do you have an opinion as to who determines what happens in  \n \n          23    the execution? \n \n          24    A    In Missouri? \n \n          25    Q    Yes. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              18 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 18of 125\n \n \n \n           1    A    John Doe One is the person who appears to be  \n \n           2    functionally in charge of everything that happens, of  \n \n           3    designing it and of how things are carried out. \n \n           4    Q    And John Doe One is the doctor who participates in the  \n \n           5    execution in Missouri? \n \n           6    A    That's right, yes. \n \n           7    Q    And what is your understanding as to which parts of  \n \n           8    the execution procedure John Doe One has control over? \n \n           9    A    My understanding is that he was involved at the very  \n \n          10    beginning of Missouri's modern execution history.  He even  \n \n          11    talks about being involved in the cyanide decision, using  \n \n          12    cyanide, and then when they decided not to use a machine  \n \n          13    that they had been using, he was called in to take over the  \n \n          14    whole process. \n \n          15              As he says, there's nobody else involved in the  \n \n          16    process who has a medical background.  And there are no  \n \n          17    other states where physicians are taking the role that he's  \n \n          18    taking so there is nobody else for him to talk to other  \n \n          19    than him, as he describes it. \n \n          20              So what the drugs are, the actions of the drugs, \n \n          21    how the IV tubing is configured, how the IV access is  \n \n          22    achieved, how many syringes there are, how much fluid is in  \n \n          23    each syringe, how much drug is in each syringe, exactly  \n \n          24    what the execution injectors do, I think he's basically set  \n \n          25    up everything about this in terms of the nonsecurity  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              19 \n \n \n \n           1    issues. \n \n           2    Q    And to your knowledge, is there any other state in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 19of 125\n \n           3    which sole discretion of the medical aspects of the  \n \n           4    procedure is seated in a single person without any guiding  \n \n           5    protocol? \n \n           6    A    The way it bureaucratically appears to work in most  \n \n           7    states is the commissioner of corrections or some  \n \n           8    administrative type person is ultimately responsible for  \n \n           9    everything that happens in the prison including everything  \n \n          10    that happens in the executions, but from a functional point  \n \n          11    of view, there's always a group of individuals who actually  \n \n          12    are in charge of the mechanics of the lethal injection  \n \n          13    procedure itself.  So this is a unique situation where  \n \n          14    there is one individual and everything appears to have been  \n \n          15    vested in him.  Everybody, including the administrators, do  \n \n          16    what he says.  And often he doesn't even tell them what  \n \n          17    he's going to do or what changes he's made.  And that's, to  \n \n          18    my knowledge, unique. \n \n          19    Q    So just to clarify, the discretion about the medical  \n \n          20    aspects of the procedures is vested in John Doe One, to  \n \n          21    your understanding? \n \n          22    A    Yes.  That's how he describes it. \n \n          23    Q    And have you reviewed John Doe One's answers to  \n \n          24    interrogatories and his deposition testimony? \n \n          25    A    I have, yes. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              20 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And based on your medical knowledge and experience,  \n \n           2    have you reached any conclusions with respect to John Doe  \n \n           3    One's medical judgment and his competence with respect to  \n \n           4    certain issues? \n \n           5    A    With respect to -- \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 20of 125\n \n           6    Q    Certain issues.  Have you reached any conclusions? \n \n           7    A    Well, certainly with respect to issues about the  \n \n           8    induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, he's made  \n \n           9    numerous important factual statements that are completely  \n \n          10    wrong and make it clear that he's not a person who's  \n \n          11    trained or credentialed or proficient in administering or  \n \n          12    understanding general anesthesia and the drugs that we use. \n \n          13              He also has described a difficulty with numbers,  \n \n          14    which is very problematic for a person who is going to be  \n \n          15    supervising or drawing up drugs and the various  \n \n          16    quantitative aspects of that.  And in the addition to  \n \n          17    flat-out factual errors, important factual errors, I also  \n \n          18    have concerns about judgments that he's made, medical  \n \n          19    judgments. \n \n          20    Q    What do you base your opinion on? \n \n          21    A    On reading his depositions, or testimony and  \n \n          22    interrogatories. \n \n          23    Q    Okay.  So first, I'd like to talk with you about John  \n \n          24    Doe One's determination and his recordkeeping with respect  \n \n          25    to the doses of thiopental given at an execution.  Have you  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              21 \n \n \n \n           1    reviewed John Doe One's testimony with respect to his  \n \n           2    determination of how much thiopental to give at the most  \n \n           3    recent executions? \n \n           4    A    Yes, I have. \n \n           5    Q    The previous five executions.  And based on Doe One's  \n \n           6    deposition testimony, can you tell me how much thiopental  \n \n           7    Doe One prepared in each of the last five executions? \n \n           8    A    I can give you my -- a guess, but it's very unclear  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 21of 125\n \n           9    exactly what happened because he's -- he has a poor memory  \n \n          10    about what has transpired and has had to correct himself on  \n \n          11    several occasions going back and forth about what was \n \n          12    given.  And also he has, as he says, a numerical dyslexia,  \n \n          13    so it's difficult for him to be certain about numbers. \n \n          14              As best as I can tell, somewhere between --  \n \n          15    somewhere five grams or below may have been given.  In many  \n \n          16    it's possible that it was two and a half grams, but it's  \n \n          17    very difficult to see what happened.   \n \n          18              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, may the record reflect  \n \n          19    that I am showing defense counsel what has been marked as  \n \n          20    Plaintiff's Exhibit 25. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  The record will reflect that. \n \n          22              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you.  And may I approach the  \n \n          23    witness, Your Honor? \n \n          24              THE COURT:  You may.  And you don't need to ask  \n \n          25    each time.  Just go do what you need to do. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              22 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Have you seen this before? \n \n           2    A    Yes, I have. \n \n           3    Q    Is that the chemical log in which the -- how each drug  \n \n           4    is used is recorded? \n \n           5    A    Yes, it is. \n \n           6    Q    Okay.  I'd like to draw your attention to a portion of  \n \n           7    the testimony of John Doe One, just looking at page 14,  \n \n           8    I'll read it to you so you don't need to follow along if  \n \n           9    you don't want to.  He states, \"I was unable to mix this.   \n \n          10    We show that we gave the five grams because we have no  \n \n          11    provision for showing that we disposed of three and gave  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 22of 125\n \n          12    two, or disposed of two and gave three, because this has  \n \n          13    not been set up that way.  We either show we used it all or  \n \n          14    disposed of it all.\"   \n \n          15              Based on that testimony, what is your conclusion  \n \n          16    with respect to the accuracy of the chemical log that I  \n \n          17    just handed you?   \n \n          18    A    Well, the chemical log has a column for the amount  \n \n          19    that's injected, and the physician's testimony says that of  \n \n          20    the amount they drew up, of the amount that was available,  \n \n          21    some was given, some was not given, but there is no record  \n \n          22    of exactly how much was -- falls into each category.  So  \n \n          23    there is a log here that says numbers, but according to the  \n \n          24    physician's testimony, they may or may not be accurate. \n \n          25    Q    And is it possible the tell from the chemical log how  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              23 \n \n \n \n           1    many thiopental bottles were checked out? \n \n           2    A    Yes, it is. \n \n           3    Q    And looking at the chemical log, has that number  \n \n           4    varied over the past five executions? \n \n           5    A    Well, in some cases it says that ten bottles were  \n \n           6    checked out.  In some cases -- one case it says ten bottles  \n \n           7    were checked out, but then that number is changed to an  \n \n           8    eight.  In other cases -- in another case it says six.  In  \n \n           9    another case it says five.  So there's variation of  \n \n          10    probably between five and ten bottles. \n \n          11    Q    And based on that fact and the doctor's testimony, do  \n \n          12    you think that both the intended dose and the actual dose  \n \n          13    of thiopental have varied in the past several executions? \n \n          14    A    Well, clearly the intended dose has, in all  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 23of 125\n \n          15    likelihood, varied.  If they checked out ten bottles on  \n \n          16    some occasions and five bottles in other occasions, that  \n \n          17    appears to be an intent to give different amounts. \n \n          18              As far as the actual amount that's delivered, we  \n \n          19    have no way of knowing how much active thiopental drug was  \n \n          20    actually delivered into the prisoner's circulation. \n \n          21    Q    And based on your review of the discovery responses,  \n \n          22    who oversees the process of recording the drugs that are  \n \n          23    given in the chemical log? \n \n          24    A    The physician. \n \n          25    Q    John Doe One? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              24 \n \n \n \n           1    A    John Doe One. \n \n           2    Q    And to your knowledge, is the actual dose given at the  \n \n           3    execution recorded anywhere? \n \n           4    A    No, it's not. \n \n           5    Q    In your practice inducing general anesthesia, do you  \n \n           6    record the dose of anesthetic that you give? \n \n           7    A    Yes.  It's very important to record the precise amount  \n \n           8    of drugs that are administered. \n \n           9    Q    So that's standard practice to record doses? \n \n          10    A    Yes.  That's essential standard practice. \n \n          11    Q    And do you train residents? \n \n          12    A    I do, yes. \n \n          13    Q    Do you teach residents about the importance of  \n \n          14    recording actual doses given? \n \n          15    A    It's one of the first things they learn how to do is  \n \n          16    to complete an accurate chart or record of what was done  \n \n          17    during a procedure. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 24of 125\n \n          18    Q    If a resident consistently fails to record doses, what  \n \n          19    would be the consequences? \n \n          20    A    If they consistently failed, after being admonished  \n \n          21    and told they needed to do this properly, they wouldn't be   \n \n          22    allowed to continue through the residency. \n \n          23    Q    Does John Doe One's apparent unconcern with recording  \n \n          24    precise actual doses raise concerns in your mind? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  It's very sloppy and it reflects a lack of  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              25 \n \n \n \n           1    understanding of the importance of the quanity of drugs  \n \n           2    that are being given. \n \n           3    Q    In an execution setting, does the actual dose of  \n \n           4    thiopental that was given matter? \n \n           5    A    It matters enormously.  As I described before, in the  \n \n           6    four phases of the execution or the lethal injection  \n \n           7    procedure, that second phase is the only phase that  \n \n           8    provides anesthesia.  So if the amount of thiopental given  \n \n           9    is inadequate, then the anesthesia will be inadequate and  \n \n          10    the procedure will be agonizing. \n \n          11    Q    Based on your review of materials produced in  \n \n          12    discovery, is it possible to conclude that an inmate was  \n \n          13    sufficiently anesthetized in any particular execution? \n \n          14    A    No.  Based on the material that's been provided, one  \n \n          15    can't conclude either way whether these prisoners were or  \n \n          16    were not properly anesthetized.   \n \n          17    Q    And is part of that because you don't how much  \n \n          18    thiopental was actually given? \n \n          19    A    Part of that is because we don't know how much  \n \n          20    thiopental was successfully delivered into their  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 25of 125\n \n          21    circulation and it's partly because the paralyzing drug is  \n \n          22    given, so regardless of whether or not the execution in  \n \n          23    fact is humane, it will appear to be peaceful and tranquil. \n \n          24    Q    Thank you.   \n \n          25              Now I'd like to ask you a few questions about  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              26 \n \n \n \n           1    John Doe One's -- your opinions as to Joe Doe One's  \n \n           2    training with respect to general anesthesia.  Do you have a  \n \n           3    conclusion as to whether Joe Doe One is qualified to  \n \n           4    oversee the induction of general anesthesia? \n \n           5    A    No, he's not.  If he were applying for a job as an  \n \n           6    anesthesiologist in any hospital in this country, there is  \n \n           7    no possibility that he would be hired as such.  He's not  \n \n           8    qualified to do this in any manner. \n \n           9    Q    So just to clarify, you do have a conclusion? \n \n          10    A    Sorry.  I do have a conclusion, yes, and that is it. \n \n          11    Q    I'm sorry.  Would you restate? \n \n          12    A    My conclusion is that he is not in any way qualified  \n \n          13    to perform or supervise the administration and the  \n \n          14    induction, the maintenance of general anesthesia. \n \n          15    Q    Does he have any training in general anesthesia? \n \n          16    A    Apparently not. \n \n          17    Q    Why is it necessary to have training in general  \n \n          18    anesthesia in order to determine doses of anesthetic and  \n \n          19    induce general anesthesia? \n \n          20    A    Anesthesiology is a very complex task.  It takes four  \n \n          21    years of medical school and then four years of  \n \n          22    post-graduate training to have acquired the knowledge base  \n \n          23    and skill set and judgment to carry it out in a safe and an  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 26of 125\n \n          24    effective way. \n \n          25    Q    And based on your review of John Doe One's testimony,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              27 \n \n \n \n           1    did he make any statements that raise concerns in your mind  \n \n           2    regarding his understanding of general anesthesia in  \n \n           3    general and thiopental specifically? \n \n           4    A    Yes, he made numerous such statements and makes it  \n \n           5    clear that he has not undergone that training.  He doesn't  \n \n           6    understand what this drug is and how it works. \n \n           7    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to a statement that  \n \n           8    John Doe One made in his deposition.  This is page 27 of  \n \n           9    the transcript, and I am reading now.  He responds to a  \n \n          10    question about thiopental, he says, quote, \"The problem  \n \n          11    with all these drugs is if you give the dose and you do not  \n \n          12    get the effect you need, you cannot simply add more drug to  \n \n          13    get the dose.  You must repeat the entire dose.\"  Do you  \n \n          14    agree with that statement? \n \n          15    A    That's completely false.  It flies in the face of our  \n \n          16    practice, what anesthesiologists do. \n \n          17    Q    Why is that? \n \n          18    A    When we give a dose of drug, we're anticipating a  \n \n          19    certain effect, but we're aware of variability between  \n \n          20    individuals and how they respond to drugs so if we don't  \n \n          21    achieve that effect, we gauge by how much we missed that  \n \n          22    intended or desired effect and we do sort of an on-the-fly  \n \n          23    calculation that's part art and part science as to how much  \n \n          24    additional drug would be required to remedy the situation,  \n \n          25    and that amount of additional drug might be less than what  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              28 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 27of 125\n \n \n \n           1    we gave before or it might be more than what we gave before  \n \n           2    or it could, by coincidence, be the same amount.  But his  \n \n           3    assertion that you have to go ahead and give the same  \n \n           4    amount again is ridiculous. \n \n           5    Q    So do you consider this a significant factual error? \n \n           6    A    Yes.  It's consistent with him not understanding what  \n \n           7    anesthesiologists do, which isn't surprising.  He hasn't  \n \n           8    been trained as an anesthesiologist. \n \n           9    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to another statement  \n \n          10    from the deposition transcript.  Page 26, line 17.  And  \n \n          11    again in discussing thiopental the doctor said, and I  \n \n          12    quote, \"The drug was chosen because it doesn't cause  \n \n          13    cardiac vascular depression so it means you can give a lot  \n \n          14    of it and your heart will still beat fine.\"  First, could  \n \n          15    you define cardiac vascular depression for us? \n \n          16    A    What he is talking about is some drugs can cause  \n \n          17    effects on the ability of the heart muscle to contract or  \n \n          18    squeeze and that means that the heartbeat or the pulse is  \n \n          19    weaker.  The heart can't eject as much blood with each  \n \n          20    heartbeat.  We also talk about vascular depressants, the  \n \n          21    drugs that lower blood pressure.  Blood vessels have  \n \n          22    muscles that can constrict to tighten up or narrow the  \n \n          23    blood vessels and raise the blood pressure, and some drugs,  \n \n          24    some anesthetic drugs, as a side effect cause those muscles  \n \n          25    to relax and then that lowers the blood pressure.  So a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              29 \n \n \n \n           1    drug that causes cardiac vascular depression is one that  \n \n           2    depresses the pumping function of the heart and also the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 28of 125\n \n           3    blood pressure. \n \n           4    Q    And do you agree with John Doe One's statement that  \n \n           5    thiopental does not cause cardiac vassular depression? \n \n           6    A    He's got it 100 percent backwards.  Thiopental is  \n \n           7    notorious for causing cardiac vascular depression,  \n \n           8    especially in patients who have had trauma.  John Doe One  \n \n           9    talks about anesthetizing people in trauma situations,  \n \n          10    which is a scary proposition if he thinks that thiopental  \n \n          11    does not cause cardiac vascular depression.  There were  \n \n          12    many, many military deaths that occurred back in World  \n \n          13    War II and the Korean War when thiopental was given to  \n \n          14    trauma victims before people understood this effect. \n \n          15    Q    So would you expect that an anesthesiologist would  \n \n          16    make this type of factual mistake? \n \n          17    A    No, it's not conceivable. \n \n          18    Q    Okay.  I'd like to draw your attention to another  \n \n          19    statement from the deposition transcript.  This is on page  \n \n          20    95, line 4.  Again in response to a question about  \n \n          21    thiopental, John Doe One stated, I quote, \"You want a rapid  \n \n          22    onset of the drug, and these drugs are rapid onset drugs.   \n \n          23    If you give them slowly they just don't work.\"  Do you  \n \n          24    agree with the statement that it's necessary to inject  \n \n          25    thiopental very quickly? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              30 \n \n \n \n           1    A    That statement is false. \n \n           2    Q    And why is that? \n \n           3    A    I just know factually I have injected -- used  \n \n           4    thiopental many, many times to induce general anesthesia.   \n \n           5    I do not inject it as quickly as I can.  I inject it at a  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 29of 125\n \n           6    measured rate and it, nevertheless, achieves the desired  \n \n           7    effect, the effect that I'm looking for. \n \n           8              He also talks about the drug being metabolized  \n \n           9    while it's traveling up the arm, and that's just not true.   \n \n          10    That's not how thiopental works. \n \n          11    Q    Do you consider this a significant error? \n \n          12    A    Yes.  It just shows that he doesn't know what he's  \n \n          13    talking about when it comes to the use of thiopental. \n \n          14    Q    And again, would you expect anesthesiologists to make  \n \n          15    this type of factual error? \n \n          16    A    No. \n \n          17    Q    Is it necessary to understand the pharmacology of  \n \n          18    thiopental when determining the dose of thiopental to be  \n \n          19    used for induction of general anesthesia? \n \n          20    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          21    Q    And why is that? \n \n          22    A    Thiopental is a complicated drug and a lot of its  \n \n          23    actions are counter-intuitive.  It's a drug that we  \n \n          24    consider to have -- it's a high-risk or low safety margin  \n \n          25    drug, and it's important to understand how it works, how it  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              31 \n \n \n \n           1    travels around the body, where it exerts its effects, and  \n \n           2    understand how different individuals -- how their responses  \n \n           3    can vary. \n \n           4    Q    And does John Doe One have any training in the  \n \n           5    pharmacology of thiopental? \n \n           6    A    No. \n \n           7    Q    Based on his testimony and what we have spoken about  \n \n           8    so far, do you think that he understands the pharmacology  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 30of 125\n \n           9    of thiopental? \n \n          10    A    No, it's clear that he doesn't. \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  May the record reflect that I am  \n \n          12    showing opposing counsel what has been marked as  \n \n          13    Plaintiff's Exhibit 26.   \n \n          14              MR. HAWKE:  We have not been provided a copy of  \n \n          15    that.   \n \n          16              MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry.   \n \n          17    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Have you seen this before, what I  \n \n          18    just gave you? \n \n          19    A    I have, yes. \n \n          20    Q    And what is it? \n \n          21    A    This is a printout of what's called a package insert.   \n \n          22    A lot of times when drugs come, they come in a box and  \n \n          23    there's a folded-up piece of paper inserted in that box  \n \n          24    that has a lot of technical information about the compound. \n \n          25    Q    And would you and other anesthesiologists generally  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              32 \n \n \n \n           1    rely on this when preparing and administering thiopental? \n \n           2    A    Yes.  It's always available so if you have a question,  \n \n           3    if you want to know something about a certain situation,  \n \n           4    then it's available in the kit.  Like an instruction  \n \n           5    manual. \n \n           6              MS. ANDERS:  I'd like to offer Plaintiff's  \n \n           7    Exhibit 26 into evidence. \n \n           8              MR. HAWKE:  No objection, Your Honor. \n \n           9              THE COURT:  It will be received. \n \n          10    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  If you'd look at page two for me,  \n \n          11    Dr. Heath, under the heading Warnings, could you read the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 31of 125\n \n          12    sentence that starts with the words \"This drug\"?  \n \n          13    A    It says, \"This drug should be administered only by  \n \n          14    persons qualified in the use of intravenous anesthetic.\" \n \n          15    Q    In your opinion, is John Doe One qualified in the use  \n \n          16    of intravenous anesthetics? \n \n          17    A    No, he's not. \n \n          18    Q    Are your concerns about John Doe One's understanding  \n \n          19    of intravenous anesthetics limited to thiopental? \n \n          20    A    No.  There are other intravenous anesthetics that he  \n \n          21    clearly doesn't understand what they are or what they do. \n \n          22    Q    Is Versed a commonly-used intravenous anesthetic?  \n \n          23    A    Yes.  Versed is one of the most commonly used  \n \n          24    anesthetic drugs in procedures.   \n \n          25    Q    In John Doe One's interrogatory answers he states  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              33 \n \n \n \n           1    that midazolam is the antidote to Versed, and that's the  \n \n           2    answer to Interrogatory No. 37.  Do you agree with that  \n \n           3    statement?  \n \n           4    A    I'm sorry.  He says midazolam is the antidote --  \n \n           5    Q    To Versed.  \n \n           6    A    To Versed.  No, that's completely incorrect.  He has  \n \n           7    it 100 percent backwards. \n \n           8    Q    And why is that? \n \n           9    A    There is an antidote to Versed, but it's not  \n \n          10    midazolam.  Midazolam in fact is Versed, and it has  \n \n          11    sedative properties.  The antidote to Versed is something  \n \n          12    that would wake you up, make you more awake if you've been  \n \n          13    given Versed, so he's got it completely backwards. \n \n          14    Q    Is that a factual error that you would expect  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 32of 125\n \n          15    anesthesiologists to make? \n \n          16    A    No.  No anesthesiologist would make that error. \n \n          17    Q    Does John Doe One's incorrect understanding of Versed  \n \n          18    raise doubts in your mind as to his understanding of  \n \n          19    intervenous anesthetics? \n \n          20    A    Yes.  If he's confusing midazolam and Versed and the  \n \n          21    antidotes, he doesn't know what he's talking about. \n \n          22    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to another portion of  \n \n          23    the testimony of John Doe One's deposition.  This is line  \n \n          24    26 -- I'm sorry, page 26, and John Doe One states that he  \n \n          25    is dyslexic.  Does the doctor's dyslexia also raise  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              34 \n \n \n \n           1    concerns in your mind regarding his ability to adequately  \n \n           2    determine doses of general anesthesia and to proceed with  \n \n           3    induction of general anesthesia? \n \n           4    A    Yes.  He described difficulty completing a cable bill  \n \n           5    I think because he was transposing numbers and even though  \n \n           6    he had a couple of hours to work on it things weren't  \n \n           7    working properly for him in terms of getting the numbers  \n \n           8    right.  And some people have that problem and those people  \n \n           9    are unsuitable for anesthesiology or other medical  \n \n          10    specialties that require a lot of calculations on the fly. \n \n          11    Q    Would that affect his ability to be a surgeon  \n \n          12    necessarily? \n \n          13    A    No, he could well be very gifted with his hands and  \n \n          14    with anatomy.  That's a completely different kind of  \n \n          15    activity than having to make precise and rapid calculations  \n \n          16    about drug doses. \n \n          17    Q    So in sum, do you think that John Doe One, based on  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 33of 125\n \n          18    his training and testimony, is competent to determine doses  \n \n          19    of and induce general anesthesia? \n \n          20    A    No.  He should not be entrusted with the provision,  \n \n          21    the induction, the administration, or the maintenance of  \n \n          22    general anesthesia. \n \n          23    Q    Do you think that entrusting John Doe One with those  \n \n          24    responsibilities creates a significant risk that an inmate  \n \n          25    will be inadequately anesthetized and, therefore, may  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              35 \n \n \n \n           1    suffer severe pain during an execution? \n \n           2    A    Yes, it does.  Any time you entrust a complicated  \n \n           3    activity like that to somebody who isn't qualified or  \n \n           4    competent to do it, then that risk develops. \n \n           5    Q    Now I'd like to ask you a few questions about John Doe  \n \n           6    One's stated inability to mix five grams of thiopental, so  \n \n           7    I'd like to direct your attention to John Doe One's answer  \n \n           8    to the court's interrogatories, this is No. 5, where John  \n \n           9    Doe One states that he was unable to administer the planned  \n \n          10    five-gram dose of thiopental because of, quote, difficulty  \n \n          11    dissolving powder in the solution that he was using. \n \n          12              In your experience, is the powder in the  \n \n          13    thiopental bottle soluable in solution?  \n \n          14    A    Yes, it is.  One of those properties of that powder  \n \n          15    preparation is that we're able to dissolve it in solution. \n \n          16    Q    And what does that mean? \n \n          17    A    Like when you put sugar in iced tea, you take a  \n \n          18    spoonful of the sugar and you put it in the tea and you mix  \n \n          19    it around and that solid material, those crystals,  \n \n          20    disappear and they are now in solution in the iced tea. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 34of 125\n \n          21              It's the same with the thiopental powder.  The  \n \n          22    powder is added into an aqueous or a water solution and one  \n \n          23    mixes it until it disappears. \n \n          24    Q    What are the reasons that the powder in the thiopental  \n \n          25    bottle might not dissolve easily? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              36 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, one of the properties of thiopental is it does  \n \n           2    dissolve quickly, just like the sugar that goes in the iced  \n \n           3    tea.  If you put a spoonful of what you think is sugar in  \n \n           4    the iced tea and you mix it and there's still, no matter  \n \n           5    how much you mix it, grains of stuff left over, then there  \n \n           6    may be sand or something else in that sugar.  It's not all  \n \n           7    sugar. \n \n           8              The same with thiopental.  One of its properties  \n \n           9    is that you can put it in water and it will dissolve.  So  \n \n          10    if it doesn't dissolve, then you have to worry that maybe  \n \n          11    the preparation is not pure thiopental, that it's degraded;   \n \n          12    or if there's been a manufacturing error, an error in the  \n \n          13    shipping or the handling of the thiopental or its storage;  \n \n          14    or that the solution that you're putting it into isn't the  \n \n          15    solution that you think it is.  It isn't the right mixing  \n \n          16    solution, something is wrong; or you have done a  \n \n          17    calculation error.  You're trying to put in a different  \n \n          18    amount than you think you are.  Something is wrong with  \n \n          19    that picture.  I don't know which of those things it is. \n \n          20    Q    So you mentioned that the thiopental might be  \n \n          21    defective or might not have all the properties of  \n \n          22    thiopental.  If that were the case, would the powder's  \n \n          23    anesthetic properties also be affected? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 35of 125\n \n          24    A    Yes.  If it's not a thiopental, then that's not an  \n \n          25    anesthetic anymore to provide anesthesia. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              37 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And if it was defective, it couldn't be dissolved, it  \n \n           2    could also not have the expected anesthetic properties? \n \n           3    A    Right.  If it can't be dissolved, then it's lacking  \n \n           4    the properties of thiopental and it may not properly  \n \n           5    induce or provide anesthesia. \n \n           6    Q    If that were to occur, if thiopental were to be  \n \n           7    defective and the prisoner ended up inadequately  \n \n           8    anesthetized, wouldn't that be obvious during the  \n \n           9    execution? \n \n          10    A    Are you saying that if the thiopental wasn't working  \n \n          11    properly, it wasn't thiopental, and the execution proceeded  \n \n          12    using that bad compound, are you saying would that be  \n \n          13    obvious to the witnesses?  \n \n          14    Q    Yes.  I'm asking if you think that would be observable  \n \n          15    or obvious.  \n \n          16    A    No, I think things would look very similar.  The  \n \n          17    first -- the drug would go in, the thiopental, but it  \n \n          18    wouldn't be thiopental so the prisoner, nothing would  \n \n          19    happen to him.  And then the second drug would go in, which  \n \n          20    is the pancuronium, which in this dose would cause a rapid  \n \n          21    onset of paralysis so the prisoner would very rapidly  \n \n          22    develop a relaxed look on his face and his eyes would  \n \n          23    calmly close and he would look like he was peacefully  \n \n          24    asleep when in fact he would be wide awake and unable to  \n \n          25    draw a breath and was suffocating.  And when the potassium  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              38 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 36of 125\n \n \n \n           1    was administered, normally that would make him scream and  \n \n           2    struggle, but he would be unable to do that because the  \n \n           3    pancuronium would still be paralyzing him.  So it would  \n \n           4    look pretty much the same I think. \n \n           5    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to another statement  \n \n           6    from John Doe One's deposition.  This is on page 45.  In  \n \n           7    response to the question, \"Did you ever consider the  \n \n           8    possibility that the thiopental might be defective,\" he  \n \n           9    answered, quote, \"No.  It's a compound.  It's like salt or  \n \n          10    sugar.  It's a chemical.  There is nothing -- it  \n \n          11    deteriorates after it's been mixed, but there is nothing in  \n \n          12    pentothal that can out-date as long as it's in powder.\"   \n \n          13              So do you agree with the statement that because  \n \n          14    pentothal is stable in powder form it couldn't possibly be  \n \n          15    defective? \n \n          16    A    That statement is incorrect.  There can be problems  \n \n          17    with the manufacture of thiopental so that it doesn't  \n \n          18    dissolve properly, so that it's not working properly.  And  \n \n          19    so he's just wrong there. \n \n          20    Q    To your knowledge, does the manufacturer of pentothal  \n \n          21    recognize that batches of thiopental could be defective? \n \n          22    A    The package insert discusses what to do when the  \n \n          23    thiopental doesn't properly go into solution and it  \n \n          24    says one should not use that solution.  It should be  \n \n          25    discarded. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              39 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And looking at another statement in John Doe One's  \n \n           2    deposition transcript, page 44, he states about the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 37of 125\n \n           3    thiopental, \"Some medications have an inert compound in or  \n \n           4    a secondary compound to prevent improper dose.\"  First, is  \n \n           5    there an inert compound in thiopental that limits its  \n \n           6    solubility in water? \n \n           7    A    Thiopental is mixed with a powder which is sort of  \n \n           8    inert in the sense it doesn't cause anesthesia or any  \n \n           9    medical effects.  It's mixed with a salt powder called  \n \n          10    sodium carbonate, but that does not hinder its solubility  \n \n          11    in any way. \n \n          12    Q    On what are you basing this opinion? \n \n          13    A    On the package insert.  And I also, when I saw John  \n \n          14    Doe discussing especially the amount of changes he made in  \n \n          15    the thiopental mix, I telephoned the company that  \n \n          16    manufactures it to find out if in fact any such changes had  \n \n          17    been made that I wasn't aware of and I talked with a  \n \n          18    specialist at the manufacturing company who informed me  \n \n          19    there had not been any such changes or additives. \n \n          20    Q    You mentioned speaking with the manufacturer.  When  \n \n          21    you have a question about a drug, is it normal practice to  \n \n          22    call up the manufacturer and speak with a specialist? \n \n          23    A    Sure.  They put the number on the package insert just  \n \n          24    like an instruction manual for a computer or something.   \n \n          25    You can call them up and get answers to your questions. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              40 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And would you rely on those answers? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    Do you think there should be any difference in the  \n \n           4    solubility effect of the thiopental between the five-gram  \n \n           5    vial and 500-milligram vial simply because of the different  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 38of 125\n \n           6    amounts provided in the vials? \n \n           7    A    No.  The manufacturer should be making the exact same  \n \n           8    powder and the package insert applies for all the different  \n \n           9    sizes of vials, so the preparation should be identical  \n \n          10    regardless of how much is put in the bottle by the company. \n \n          11    Q    And what is your conclusion with respect to John Doe  \n \n          12    One's theory as to why the thiopental was not soluable? \n \n          13    A    It doesn't make any sense. \n \n          14    Q    Have you reached any conclusions with respect to Doe  \n \n          15    One's decision, during the first execution in which he  \n \n          16    encountered the problem, to go ahead with the execution  \n \n          17    using the lower dose? \n \n          18    A    That wasn't the right decision to make. \n \n          19    Q    And why do you think that? \n \n          20    A    Well, the concern is if the compound isn't behaving as  \n \n          21    it's supposed to, there may be some problem with the  \n \n          22    compound.  If anything, one would want to increase the dose  \n \n          23    to ensure that one was getting the right amount in.  So  \n \n          24    reducing it is trying to make a correction, but it's in the  \n \n          25    wrong direction. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              41 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Have you reached any conclusions with respect to John  \n \n           2    Doe One's failure to investigate the potential problem with  \n \n           3    thiopental after the first execution in which this  \n \n           4    occurred? \n \n           5    A    Yes.  It's very troubling. \n \n           6    Q    And do you have any conclusion with respect to John  \n \n           7    Doe One's exercise of medical judgment in not simply  \n \n           8    preparing additional syringes of thiopental? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 39of 125\n \n           9    A    That doesn't make any sense.  He ought to have not  \n \n          10    used the preparation at all.  That's what he should have  \n \n          11    done.  That's what the manufacturer says.  But given that  \n \n          12    he decided to go ahead, which was the wrong decision, he  \n \n          13    should have made up a lot more of it, not less of it. \n \n          14    Q    And looking at his deposition testimony again, on page  \n \n          15    29, he stated, quote, \"I go to the execution chamber and  \n \n          16    we're on a time frame.  I have minutes to get the drugs  \n \n          17    ready, minutes to ensure a perfect IV.  There is no time to  \n \n          18    call the drug company at midnight, the Director, or nursing  \n \n          19    staff, to change.  I am required to deal with what I'm  \n \n          20    given and make it come out right and make it happen I guess  \n \n          21    is the best way to say it.\"   \n \n          22              In your experience, does time pressure exacerbate  \n \n          23    the risks of improperly mixing thiopental, or any other  \n \n          24    drug? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  When one is trying to undertake a complex  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              42 \n \n \n \n           1    endeavor, if there's a lot of time pressure, then one is  \n \n           2    much more likely to make errors. \n \n           3    Q    Does time pressure also exacerbate the difficulty of  \n \n           4    calculating and keeping track of how much thiopental has  \n \n           5    already been mixed? \n \n           6    A    Yes, especially if I'm dyslexic. \n \n           7    Q    In your practice, would you accept time constraints  \n \n           8    that you felt were overly restrictive in preparing a dose  \n \n           9    of anesthesia? \n \n          10    A    Under exigent circumstances, if there is an emergency  \n \n          11    and somebody needs general anesthesia immediately, then  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 40of 125\n \n          12    everything would be very rushed and we would be working  \n \n          13    under time pressure and we'd have to accept that because  \n \n          14    the risks of delay would outweigh the benefits. \n \n          15    Q    And in a nonemergency situation, would you accept time  \n \n          16    constraints? \n \n          17    A    No.  In a nonemergency situation we arrive in time in  \n \n          18    the morning to set things up and have things in an orderly  \n \n          19    fashion to check and doublecheck everything to make sure  \n \n          20    that we have our ducks in a row and that we have done  \n \n          21    things properly. \n \n          22    Q    From a medical perspective, is an execution an exigent  \n \n          23    circumstance.   \n \n          24    A    No.  My understanding is there is a many-hour window  \n \n          25    in which it can legally occur, a many-day window.  But  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              43 \n \n \n \n           1    certainly I don't think it has to occur at a certain  \n \n           2    precise time.  And even if it did, the physician could show  \n \n           3    up an hour or two hours earlier, whatever it took, to allow  \n \n           4    his team to set things up in a more orderly and considered  \n \n           5    fashion. \n \n           6    Q    And given John Doe One's difficulties in mixing the  \n \n           7    thiopental, do you have concerns about whether the  \n \n           8    thiopental prepared was effective? \n \n           9    A    Yeah, I don't know whether the -- it was effective or  \n \n          10    not. \n \n          11    Q    Is it possible to be certain that inmates given  \n \n          12    insoluable thiopental were properly anesthetized during  \n \n          13    their executions? \n \n          14    A    Not from the information we have available.  Some  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 41of 125\n \n          15    states perform toxicology.  They measure the blood levels  \n \n          16    of thiopental after an execution.  And that might have  \n \n          17    provided information in these executions, but I don't  \n \n          18    believe Missouri did that. \n \n          19    Q    And do you believe that John Doe One's use of  \n \n          20    insoluable thiopental created considerable risk of pain in  \n \n          21    these executions? \n \n          22    A    If the thiopental didn't work properly, if he wasn't  \n \n          23    given the amount of actual thiopentothal that he was  \n \n          24    intending to, then the prisoner's execution would have been  \n \n          25    excruciating. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              44 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    I'd like to move on to another topic now.  Have you  \n \n           2    reviewed John Doe One's statement regarding the risks and  \n \n           3    benefits of gaining venous access through the femoral vein? \n \n           4    A    Yes, I have. \n \n           5    Q    What are your conclusions with regard to those  \n \n           6    statements? \n \n           7    A    He's again made factual statements that are not  \n \n           8    correct and then he's made errors of judgment. \n \n           9    Q    Assuming that John Doe One testified that it's  \n \n          10    impossible to pierce the femoral artery, do you agree with  \n \n          11    that statement? \n \n          12    A    No, that's completely false, and I know that because I  \n \n          13    have accidentally pierced the femoral artery while  \n \n          14    attempting to place a femoral venous access. \n \n          15    Q    And mechanically how does one pierce the femoral  \n \n          16    artery; how does that occur? \n \n          17    A    Well, we don't know by looking at the outside of a  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 42of 125\n \n          18    person's body exactly where the femoral vein is.  We use  \n \n          19    landmarks and our anatomical knowledge and feeling the  \n \n          20    pulse of the femoral artery, which is close to the femoral  \n \n          21    vein, to make our best guess as to where the femoral vein  \n \n          22    is.  But there is variation between individuals and it's  \n \n          23    always a mixture of art and science to try and understand  \n \n          24    where the vein is. \n \n          25              So we go in with a needle, a hollow needle, and  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              45 \n \n \n \n           1    we're aspirating with a syringe, drawing back and probing  \n \n           2    until we get a return of blood.  And more often than not  \n \n           3    that initial blood is venous blood, and we can tell that  \n \n           4    because it's a dark blue or purple color, but sometimes the  \n \n           5    first blood that comes back is bright red, it's arterial  \n \n           6    blood, and that means to get that we have had to have  \n \n           7    punctured the femoral artery. \n \n           8    Q    Is it possible to pierce the artery with a .22 gauge  \n \n           9    needle? \n \n          10    A    Absolutely.  You can pierce it with any needle. \n \n          11    Q    And does the Seldinger method of catheterization used  \n \n          12    by John Doe One require the use of a needle?  \n \n          13    A    Yes.  The Seldinger technique means that one pushes a  \n \n          14    needle into the blood vessel and then passes a wire through  \n \n          15    that needle and then uses that wire to insert the catheter.  \n \n          16    So one has to pierce blood vessels in order to perform the  \n \n          17    Seldinger technique. \n \n          18    Q    So you disagree with John Doe One's statement that  \n \n          19    piercing the artery is impossible using the Seldinger  \n \n          20    method? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 43of 125\n \n          21    A    It's just completely wrong.  It's a well-recognized  \n \n          22    complication that the femoral artery can be punctured or  \n \n          23    pierced or lacerated during femoral venous access. \n \n          24    Q    Would you say that arterial puncture is a particularly  \n \n          25    rare complication? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              46 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No.  I think it happens frequently. \n \n           2    Q    What are the potential complications of an arterial  \n \n           3    puncture? \n \n           4    A    Depends on how big the hole is and for how long it  \n \n           5    goes untreated.  If the hole is large and nothing is done  \n \n           6    about it, then one can lose a tremendous amount of blood  \n \n           7    out of that hole. \n \n           8    Q    Okay.  So I'd like to show you a photo -- some photos  \n \n           9    that's contained in what's already been marked and admitted  \n \n          10    as Plaintiff's Exhibit 18.  This is from the materials  \n \n          11    produced from the Johnston execution.  Have you seen this  \n \n          12    photo before? \n \n          13    A    I have, yes. \n \n          14    Q    And have you reached any conclusions with respect to  \n \n          15    it? \n \n          16    A    This photo appears to show a triple lumen catheter  \n \n          17    placed in the groin.  It's probably in the femoral vein,  \n \n          18    although I can't be certain where the tip of the catheter  \n \n          19    is because I can't see that. \n \n          20    Q    And I'd like to give you a hard copy of this so you  \n \n          21    can mark where you see. \n \n          22    A    Okay. \n \n          23              THE COURT:  He can mark at his location. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 44of 125\n \n          24              THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Use your finger, and if  \n \n          25    you want to clear it, just press this (indicating.) \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              47 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So using that, could you mark for us  \n \n           2    where you see the hematoma in this photograph? \n \n           3    A    So -- can you hear me like that?   \n \n           4              So hematoma is a mass of blood, a collection of  \n \n           5    blood that occurs inside the body where blood has leaked  \n \n           6    out of a blood vessel.  And what you see here is the  \n \n           7    catheter going into the groin and there's a ridge at the  \n \n           8    end of the catheter, a raised ridge, that's got a blue  \n \n           9    discoloration, and that's a hematoma. \n \n          10              And then it's important to understand that in the  \n \n          11    thigh it can hold a lot of blood.  Several -- it can hold a  \n \n          12    liter of blood, which is the size of a liter bottle of  \n \n          13    soda, can be concealed in the thigh.  So when one is  \n \n          14    looking at the hematoma in the groin or the thigh, it's  \n \n          15    important to understand it may be the tip of the iceberg or  \n \n          16    you may be seeing all of it. \n \n          17              But what it looks to me is like the swelling is  \n \n          18    extended into the deeper tissue into a larger area causing  \n \n          19    this bulge under here in the side of the thigh.  And there  \n \n          20    is also an area of blue discoloration in this zone here.   \n \n          21    So it looks like there's -- beneath this here is a larger  \n \n          22    area of blood collection and that this blue raised area is  \n \n          23    the superficial manifestation of that. \n \n          24    Q    Okay.  I'd like the record to reflect that Dr. Heath  \n \n          25    has marked an oval-shaped portion around the catheter  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              48 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 45of 125\n \n \n \n           1    entrance that's shown on the photo. \n \n           2              Is the fact that a hematoma occurred here  \n \n           3    indicative of medical negligence or error? \n \n           4    A    Not at all.  Hematoma is a recognized complication of  \n \n           5    femoral venous access because as I said you can't know  \n \n           6    exactly where the artery and vein are.  And it's happened  \n \n           7    to me.  A hematoma can occur in the best of hands, and does  \n \n           8    occur in the best of hands.  It happens to everybody, to  \n \n           9    all patients.   Excuse me, it happens to many patients.  It  \n \n          10    happens to all physicians who perform these things  \n \n          11    frequently. \n \n          12    Q    I'd just like to refer you to another part of John Doe  \n \n          13    One's deposition testimony.  When asked about the hematoma  \n \n          14    in the photo he stated, quote, \"What they are seeing is the  \n \n          15    site where I injected my local anesthesia.  It causes a  \n \n          16    little blue mark.\"  Page 102. \n \n          17              In your experience in inserting a femoral line  \n \n          18    for the induction of anesthesia, local anesthesia, has it  \n \n          19    ever caused a blue mark?  \n \n          20    A    No, local anesthesia is a clear solution and it can't  \n \n          21    cause blue discoloration.  I suppose when injecting the  \n \n          22    local anesthesia he could have ruptured a blood vessel and  \n \n          23    caused a hematoma, but either way, whatever it was that  \n \n          24    caused this, this is blue and it's from blood collecting  \n \n          25    there.  It's not from local anesthetic.  That's just not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              49 \n \n \n \n           1    possible. \n \n           2    Q    Have you ever heard of a blue mark from local  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 46of 125\n \n           3    anesthesia occurring, in your discussions with colleagues? \n \n           4    A    No, unless they injected -- they caused a hematoma in  \n \n           5    the act of injecting it.  But the local anesthetic itself  \n \n           6    doesn't cause a blue discoloration.  \n \n           7    Q    So does Doe One's explanation change your conclusion  \n \n           8    that there is a hematoma here? \n \n           9    A    No.  The photograph shows a hematoma. \n \n          10    Q    Now I'd like to show you another photograph.  This is  \n \n          11    contained in Plaintiff's Exhibit 21, which has been marked  \n \n          12    and admitted.  This is from the Smith execution.   \n \n          13              THE COURT:  What exhibit?  You say this is a  \n \n          14    different exhibit? \n \n          15              MS. ANDERS:  Yes.  This is from the Smith  \n \n          16    execution contained in Plaintiff's Exhibit 21. \n \n          17    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So this is from another execution,  \n \n          18    the Smith execution.  Do you see a blue mark on this photo? \n \n          19    A    No, I don't. \n \n          20    Q    And looking at this photo, is there any indication  \n \n          21    that any complication arose during this femoral procedure? \n \n          22    A    No, there isn't. \n \n          23    Q    But there is such evidence in the photo from the  \n \n          24    Johnston execution that we just saw?  \n \n          25    A    Yes.  The photographs are very different.  It clearly  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              50 \n \n \n \n           1    shows a hematoma is present. \n \n           2    Q    Does it raise concerns in your mind that John Doe One  \n \n           3    isn't admitting that the hematoma exists? \n \n           4    A    Yes.  It's right there in the photograph.  It's a  \n \n           5    recognized complication that can occur.  I don't understand  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 47of 125\n \n           6    why he doesn't see it there. \n \n           7    Q    Could hematoma such as the one that occurred during  \n \n           8    the Johnston execution be painful? \n \n           9    A    Yes. \n \n          10    Q    How does a hematoma cause pain? \n \n          11    A    Well, when the hematoma forms in the groin it distends  \n \n          12    and stretches and distorts the tissue and the groin is an  \n \n          13    area that has a lot of nerve or sensory nerve innervation,  \n \n          14    it's a sensitive area, so when that tissue is distorted and  \n \n          15    stretched that causes pain. \n \n          16    Q    Can you tell definitively whether the hematoma in the  \n \n          17    Johnston photo was painful? \n \n          18    A    The only way you know for sure is to ask him whether  \n \n          19    it hurt.  I don't know for sure.  It looks painful. \n \n          20    Q    How would someone behave if they were in pain? \n \n          21    A    A restrained -- a nonrestrained person would wriggle  \n \n          22    around.  Probably put their hand on the area that was  \n \n          23    hurting.  He would probably try adjusting his position,  \n \n          24    flex his thigh, his groin, trying to find a comfortable  \n \n          25    position, those kind of movements. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              51 \n \n \n \n           1              He's restrained so I'm not sure how much movement  \n \n           2    you'd be able to see. \n \n           3    Q    And what else could you rely on in ascertaining  \n \n           4    whether Johnston felt pain from the hematoma? \n \n           5    A    You can't rely for sure on anything without asking  \n \n           6    him, but you can see how other people described his  \n \n           7    behavior. \n \n           8    Q    So would you rely on an observer's account in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 48of 125\n \n           9    determining whether or ascertaining whether someone might  \n \n          10    have been in pain from the hematoma? \n \n          11    A    Yes.  I think that's one of the reasons the state  \n \n          12    wants witnesses to be there to be able to report whether or  \n \n          13    not pain occurred, whether or not it was humane. \n \n          14    Q    I'd like to quote to you a newspaper article about the  \n \n          15    Johnston execution. \n \n          16              MR. HAWKE:  Objection, Your Honor.  This has not  \n \n          17    been part of discovery and appears to be hearsay. \n \n          18              MS. ANDERS:  We're not admitting it in evidence.   \n \n          19    It's just something that he's relied on in testifying,   \n \n          20    whether it's consistent with -- \n \n          21              THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the objection. \n \n          22    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So do you agree with John Doe One's  \n \n          23    statement that there are no risks to the inmate from  \n \n          24    femoral catheterization? \n \n          25    A    That statement is false. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              52 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And do you think that John Doe One fails to  \n \n           2    acknowledge some of the common complications of femoral  \n \n           3    catheterization? \n \n           4    A    Yes, he does. \n \n           5    Q    In your opinion, is it dangerous for a physician to  \n \n           6    perform a procedure and not to acknowledge the risks that  \n \n           7    could flow from the procedure? \n \n           8    A    Yes.  Before we're allowed to do them on our own  \n \n           9    without supervision we have to be able to recite what the  \n \n          10    complications are, what the risks are that can occur. \n \n          11              MS.

ANDERS:  I'm just going to ask a question or  \n \n          17    two about something that's been redacted from the John Doe  \n \n          18    One transcript. \n \n          19    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Dr. Heath, in performing a femoral  \n \n          20    catheterization, is it important for the doctor doing it to  \n \n          21    be proficient in the procedure? \n \n          22    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          23    Q    Why is that? \n \n          24    A    Any femoral line is a complex procedure and it's being  \n \n          25    done in a critical area of the body where there are large  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              53 \n \n \n \n           1    blood vessels and a large nerve and if one is not  \n \n           2    proficient in this, then severe complications are more  \n \n           3    likely to ensue. \n \n           4    Q    John Doe One stated in interrogatory responses that he  \n \n           5    has not regularly inserted femoral lines in the past few  \n \n           6    years.  He testified in his deposition that he is not in  \n \n           7    active practice.  Do those facts raise concerns in your  \n \n           8    mind about John Doe One's proficiency in performing femoral  \n \n           9    catheterizations? \n \n          10    A    Yes.  Part of what proficiency is, one element is a  \n \n          11    thing we call currency.  It's like pilots flying planes.  \n \n          12    One has to be doing it with a certain frequency to be  \n \n          13    considered suitable to continue doing it.  And if he hasn't  \n \n          14    been performing this for a number of years, then he lacks  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 50of 125\n \n          15    the currency that would be necessary.   \n \n          16    Q    Is it your practice when performing femoral  \n \n          17    catheterization to sedate a patient before inserting the  \n \n          18    femoral line? \n \n          19    A    Yes.  Some of my patients are already under general  \n \n          20    anesthesia when I'm placing a central line or femoral line,  \n \n          21    but if somebody were not under general anesthesia, then I  \n \n          22    would start a peripheral IV to give them analgesics or  \n \n          23    painkillers and sedation. \n \n          24    Q    Why would you do that? \n \n          25    A    Because it's a very nasty procedure to endure without  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              54 \n \n \n \n           1    any sedation or pain killer. \n \n           2    Q    And to your knowledge, does John Doe One sedate  \n \n           3    prisoners before performing femoral catheterization? \n \n           4    A    He does not, no. \n \n           5    Q    In your testimony are you distinguishing between the  \n \n           6    local anesthetic and intravenous sedation? \n \n           7    A    Right.  Intravenous sedation obviously goes everywhere  \n \n           8    in the body including the brain and intravenous analgesics  \n \n           9    or painkillers also travel throughout the body, and so  \n \n          10    that's different from local anesthesia which is just given  \n \n          11    directly in the groin area and does not affect one's  \n \n          12    ability to experience pain or level of consciousness. \n \n          13    Q    So do you believe that the failure to sedate an inmate  \n \n          14    before performing catheterization is indicative of  \n \n          15    questionable medical judgment on the part of John Doe One? \n \n          16    A    Yes.  It's standard, whenever possible when one can  \n \n          17    obtain a peripheral IV, which is the case in almost all  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 51of 125\n \n          18    patients, that one first puts in a peripheral IV and uses  \n \n          19    that to give sedation and analgesia and then you put in the  \n \n          20    femoral venous line.       \n \n          21    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to some more of the  \n \n          22    deposition transcript.  On page 104 John Doe One states he  \n \n          23    was unable to place a femoral line and therefore placed a  \n \n          24    subclavian line.  Are there different risks inherent in  \n \n          25    placing a subclavian line? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              55 \n \n \n \n           1    A    There certainly are, yes. \n \n           2    Q    And could you describe them? \n \n           3    A    Well, the subclavian line goes in right by the  \n \n           4    collarbone.  It's close to the heart and close to the  \n \n           5    lungs.  And it's a very well-recognized complication that  \n \n           6    the needle can open up the -- can damage the lung and cause  \n \n           7    air to enter the spaces that surround the lung and cause a  \n \n           8    compression of the lung which is a thing we call  \n \n           9    pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax, and that's an  \n \n          10    emergency situation that's extremely agonizing.  One is  \n \n          11    basically suffocating to death and it needs emergency  \n \n          12    intervention. \n \n          13              Another problem that can occur when using a  \n \n          14    Seldinger technique, the subclavian technique, is that the  \n \n          15    wire tends to enter the heart and can cause arrhythmia, can  \n \n          16    cause the heart to beat improperly, or even stop the heart,  \n \n          17    and obviously that's another emergency situation that needs  \n \n          18    to be corrected immediately. \n \n          19    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to a statement from  \n \n          20    the deposition transcript of John Doe One in discussing  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 52of 125\n \n          21    subclavian line access.  He says, quote, \"Yes, but it  \n \n          22    requires significant modification of the facility.  In  \n \n          23    other words, the bed must have the capability of being  \n \n          24    tilted with the feet up so these veins would dilate  \n \n          25    sufficiently to guarantee safety.  Plus it would be  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              56 \n \n \n \n           1    prudent to have chest tube capability available.  I have  \n \n           2    rudimentary chest tube capability on this tray as I have  \n \n           3    selected.  But if you said I would always do subclavian, I  \n \n           4    would have chest tube available on every occasion.\"   \n \n           5              Is it your understanding from that testimony that  \n \n           6    John Doe One does not have the equipment necessary to treat  \n \n           7    the complications of subclavian access in the execution? \n \n           8    A    Yes, that's right.  He's saying that -- he's correctly  \n \n           9    stating that when one embarks on this procedure one needs  \n \n          10    to have available certain equipment and supplies including  \n \n          11    the equipment to put in a chest tube, which is a large tube  \n \n          12    about the size of one's finger that goes between the ribs  \n \n          13    into the space outside the lungs. \n \n          14    Q    What complication would that chest tubing be necessary  \n \n          15    to treat? \n \n          16    A    It would be necessary to treat what's called a tension  \n \n          17    pneumothorax which is where air is collecting outside the  \n \n          18    lung and inside the chest and collapsing or compressing the  \n \n          19    lung. \n \n          20    Q    John Doe One also said in what I just read that there  \n \n          21    is rudimentary chest tube capability in the catheter tray  \n \n          22    that he uses.  Do you know what he means by that? \n \n          23    A    There is no chest tube capability.  There is a small  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 53of 125\n \n          24    catheter like the catheter that's used for putting in  \n \n          25    peripheral IVs.  And he's quite right, that can be  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              57 \n \n \n \n           1    introduced into the chest wall to -- as a temporary  \n \n           2    measure, as an initial measure, to help reduce the  \n \n           3    pneumothorax or stop it from getting worse, but that would  \n \n           4    be vastly below the standard of care to rely solely upon  \n \n           5    that very small catheter when in fact what is needed is a  \n \n           6    much larger tube and all the equipment to insert that tube  \n \n           7    and the presence of suction so that the chest can be  \n \n           8    evacuated. \n \n           9    Q    In your practice, would you perform a procedure even  \n \n          10    once knowing you did not have the necessary equipment to  \n \n          11    treat that complication? \n \n          12    A    Again, under an exigent circumstance, if somebody  \n \n          13    needed a subclavian line on the roadside or whatever and  \n \n          14    they are going to die if you didn't have it, then you would  \n \n          15    try to put it in and hope you didn't get any of these  \n \n          16    terrible complications.  But in an elective procedure where  \n \n          17    it's scheduled ahead of time and one has time to obtain and  \n \n          18    deploy the necessary emergency equipment, then one of  \n \n          19    course needs to do that. \n \n          20    Q    Okay.  I'd like to discuss with you potassium chloride  \n \n          21    and whether it hurts when injected into the vein.  Could  \n \n          22    you just explain for me what makes potassium hurt in the  \n \n          23    veins? \n \n          24    A    Yes.  Potassium is a salt solution that is used by  \n \n          25    nerve membranes and the membranes in the heart to regulate  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              58 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 54of 125\n \n \n \n           1    their electrical activity, to regulate the voltage across  \n \n           2    the membrane.  And when potassium is put on a nerve ending  \n \n           3    or in the heart it interferes with how the nerve maintains  \n \n           4    its voltage across the membrane and it makes the nerve fire  \n \n           5    signals so the nerve thinks it's being activated in the  \n \n           6    same way it would be if the tissue were being cut or heated  \n \n           7    or traumatized. \n \n           8    Q    And looking at John Doe One's deposition testimony, on  \n \n           9    page 57 he states, in discussing potassium, \"The only way  \n \n          10    it hurts is by causing spasm in a vessel in your hand or in  \n \n          11    your arm or in your leg.\"  Do you agree with the statement  \n \n          12    that potassium does not hurt if the vein does not spasm?  \n \n          13    A    It's not the spasm that hurts.  It's the activation of  \n \n          14    the nerves in the walls of the vessel.  Anybody could  \n \n          15    potentially inject it into a vein or just in the muscle or  \n \n          16    under the skin and it would be extremely painful. \n \n          17    Q    So potassium would be painful even in veins that do  \n \n          18    not spasm? \n \n          19    A    It would be painful anywhere that has nerves, sensory  \n \n          20    nerves. \n \n          21    Q    And looking at the directly following testimony on  \n \n          22    page 58 of the John Doe deposition transcipt, he states,  \n \n          23    \"Plus the drug is diluted instantly.  The amount of blood  \n \n          24    flowing through the interior vena cava amounts to a quart  \n \n          25    every two seconds, so it's instantly dissolved.\" \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              59 \n \n \n \n           1              Could potassium not hurt in a femoral vein  \n \n           2    because it is diluted by blood volume? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 55of 125\n \n           3    A    I think he's very wrong about that. \n \n           4    Q    And why is that? \n \n           5    A    I did some thumbnail calculations and discussed it  \n \n           6    with colleagues.  We estimated that -- we know that the  \n \n           7    normal flow of blood in the body is about five liters every  \n \n           8    minute.  And we estimated that about one liter a minute is  \n \n           9    coming from the lower part of the body and flowing past  \n \n          10    where the catheter tip would be in the configuration used  \n \n          11    in the Missouri executions.  So you have one liter flowing  \n \n          12    through that vein every minute. \n \n          13              I think he describes the delivery of the  \n \n          14    potassium as occurring over about 30 seconds at one point.   \n \n          15    So in 30 seconds about half a liter or 500 mls would flow  \n \n          16    past the end of the catheter, and during that time they're  \n \n          17    injecting potassium.  I'm not sure if they're injecting 120  \n \n          18    milliequivalents or 240 milliequivalents because of the  \n \n          19    confusion about the dosing, but let's take the lower dose  \n \n          20    just to give him the benefit of the doubt.  If 120  \n \n          21    milliequivalents of potassium is injected into half a  \n \n          22    liter, that will result in a concentration of 240  \n \n          23    milliequivalents per liter, plus the normal five  \n \n          24    milliequivalents per liter that's in the blood already so  \n \n          25    it will result in the concentration of potassium that's  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              60 \n \n \n \n           1    20-fold higher -- is that right, I'm sorry.  No, 40-fold  \n \n           2    higher than what's normally present in the blood, and more  \n \n           3    than 20 fold, and that would be far higher than necessary  \n \n           4    to maximally activate the nerve fibers. \n \n           5    Q    And is the concentration of potassium high enough to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 56of 125\n \n           6    stop the heart? \n \n           7    A    Yes.  And it stops the heart in the same way that it  \n \n           8    activates nerve fibers.  It's basically activating the  \n \n           9    nerve fibers -- or the fibers in the heart that are like  \n \n          10    the nerve fibers that carry electrical statements to the  \n \n          11    heart.  So if you are giving enough to stop the heart,  \n \n          12    you're also giving enough to cause pain in the veins.  And  \n \n          13    in fact we know from reports where accidentally in a  \n \n          14    therapeutic setting a high concentration of potassium was  \n \n          15    given to a patient, and it was a terrible mistake  \n \n          16    obviously, but before stopping the heart it causes extreme  \n \n          17    pain in the veins. \n \n          18    Q    John Doe One states in his deposition testimony that  \n \n          19    it's not necessary to do any calculations to be sure that  \n \n          20    the potassium would be sufficiently diluted so that it  \n \n          21    doesn't hurt.  That's on page 61.  Do you agree with that?  \n \n          22    A    You can't know it's unnecessary to do calculations  \n \n          23    until you do them, so if you run through the numbers like I  \n \n          24    did, and again I'm making some assumptions, but I think  \n \n          25    they're all reasonable ones, then you end up with a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              61 \n \n \n \n           1    concentration that basically almost no matter what  \n \n           2    reasonable assumption one makes, it's a very high  \n \n           3    concentration and it would certainly activate nerve fibers. \n \n           4    Q    I'd next like to draw your attention to the deposition  \n \n           5    testimony of John Doe One on page 61.  He states, \"We use  \n \n           6    the femoral vein to insert a catheter that I think is about  \n \n           7    16 inches long, so actually from the femoral vein if you  \n \n           8    measure up to your xiphoid which would mean it's about two  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 57of 125\n \n           9    inches from the heart, so the catheter is almost in the  \n \n          10    heart when -- so the drug is directly injected below the  \n \n          11    heart as it enters.\" \n \n          12              In your experience, do catheterization trays  \n \n          13    always come with such a long catheter? \n \n          14    A    This -- the triple lumen catheter is what we're  \n \n          15    talking about here are not -- did you say 18 inches long?  \n \n          16    Q    16 inches.  \n \n          17    A    They are not 16 inches long and they don't go anywhere  \n \n          18    near the heart. \n \n          19              MS. ANDERS:  I'd like the record to reflect that  \n \n          20    I'm showing opposing counsel what's been marked as  \n \n          21    Plaintiff's Exhibit 28. \n \n          22    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Do you recognize this photo,  \n \n          23    Dr. Heath? \n \n          24    A    Yes.  It's the package or kit that the triple lumen  \n \n          25    catheter is supplied in.  It's a sterile and sealed kit. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              62 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    So is this an accurate representation of the catheter  \n \n           2    tray that you observed during the tour of the execution  \n \n           3    facility? \n \n           4    A    Yes, it is.  \n \n           5              MS. ANDERS:  I'd like to offer Exhibit No. 28  \n \n           6    into evidence, Your Honor. \n \n           7              MR. HAWKE:  No objection. \n \n           8              THE COURT:  Be received. \n \n           9    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Could you read the length of the  \n \n          10    catheter that is included in the catheter tray? \n \n          11    A    Yes.  It's in the first line here.  It says that the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 58of 125\n \n          12    catheter is 5 and 7/8th inches long, almost 6 inches long. \n \n          13    Q    Thank you.  And even if the catheter did go all the  \n \n          14    way almost to the heart, could the potassium still hurt? \n \n          15    A    Yes.  The heart has many sensory fibers.  We all know \n \n          16    that because a heart attack is an extremely painful thing.   \n \n          17    And so in stopping the heart it's also activating those  \n \n          18    nerve fibers.  Also, to be pumped through the actual muscle  \n \n          19    of the heart, the potassium has to travel through the right  \n \n          20    side of the heart, which is the side of the heart that  \n \n          21    pumps venous blood into the lungs, has to travel through  \n \n          22    the right side of the heart and has to be pumped through  \n \n          23    the lungs which themselves have a lot of sensory nerve  \n \n          24    endings, and then flow back from the lungs after it has  \n \n          25    picked up oxygen and be carried to the left side of the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              63 \n \n \n \n           1    heart, and from there it's pumped into the aorta and into  \n \n           2    the actual muscle of the heart. \n \n           3              It's quite possible that in order to get to the  \n \n           4    actual heart muscle it has to be pumped all the way through  \n \n           5    the lungs regardless of where it's being introduced.  But  \n \n           6    in this setting, it's being introduced no way near the  \n \n           7    heart.  It's being introduced down in the pelvis six inches  \n \n           8    from the groin where the catheter is inserted.  \n \n           9    Q    So more broadly, are John Doe One's statements with  \n \n          10    respect to the possibility of pain arising from the  \n \n          11    potassium injection, in your view, failure to acknowledge  \n \n          12    the risks of the execution? \n \n          13    A    Yes.  He's not acknowledging that there are numerous  \n \n          14    things that can go wrong and that those things can cause  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 59of 125\n \n          15    problems with drug delivery and cause problems with the  \n \n          16    humaneness of the procedure. \n \n          17    Q    In John Doe One's answers to the plaintiff's first  \n \n          18    interrogatories, this is No. 33, John Doe One states that  \n \n          19    pancuronium, quote, will mitigate likely seizure activity  \n \n          20    and involuntary movements and thus result in a more  \n \n          21    peaceful and humane death.  Do you agree with that  \n \n          22    statement? \n \n          23    A    He's partly correct.  It will stop involuntary  \n \n          24    movements.  It stops all movement, all the muscles in the  \n \n          25    body except the heart and the muscles in the blood vessels.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              64 \n \n \n \n           1    But it will stop the movement of all the muscles in the  \n \n           2    arms and the legs which are normally moving around in a  \n \n           3    seizure.  But he's wrong, it won't stop the seizure.  The  \n \n           4    seizure is actually a thing that happens in the brain.   \n \n           5    It's abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and when we  \n \n           6    see somebody jerking around in a seizure that's what we  \n \n           7    call the motor manifestations, the muscle manifestations of  \n \n           8    what's occurring in the brain, and pancuronium wouldn't  \n \n           9    afect that.  It doesn't really enter the brain.  And so  \n \n          10    while it will stop physical movement, it wouldn't stop the  \n \n          11    seizure from occurring.  It certainly wouldn't make it any  \n \n          12    more humane.   \n \n          13    Q    Does pancuronium have any anesthetic or sedative  \n \n          14    effect? \n \n          15    A    None whatsoever.  The only effect it has is to stop  \n \n          16    one's ability to move muscles that we're normally able to  \n \n          17    control.  It doesn't affect our thinking or ability to feel  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 60of 125\n \n          18    pain, our consciousness or awareness, and it doesn't affect  \n \n          19    whether a seizure occurs or not. \n \n          20    Q    So have John Doe One's statements in this case given  \n \n          21    you concerns about whether he's competent to ensure that  \n \n          22    executions are performed humanely? \n \n          23    A    Well, given how these executions are being performed  \n \n          24    in a way that requires general anesthesia to first be  \n \n          25    successfully administered and monitored, no, he's not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              65 \n \n \n \n           1    competent to do that. \n \n           2    Q    What are you basing that on? \n \n           3    A    On the numerous factual errors, some of which you  \n \n           4    raised here, but he has things just completely backwards.   \n \n           5    It's like he's driving on the wrong side of the road and  \n \n           6    doesn't realize it.  That's very concerning. \n \n           7    Q    Do these factual errors raise concerns in your mind  \n \n           8    about John Doe One's medical judgment? \n \n           9    A    Well, first of all, you can't have good medical  \n \n          10    judgment -- if your facts are wrong, then your judgment  \n \n          11    can't be good.  But even if he had the right facts, some of  \n \n          12    the judgment calls that he's made are very concerning. \n \n          13    Q    Do you believe that entrusting John Doe One with  \n \n          14    responsibility for inducing general anesthesia, including  \n \n          15    the preparation of thiopental, creates a significant risk  \n \n          16    that the inmate will be improperly anesthetized? \n \n          17    A    It does, yes.  He should never be entrusted with  \n \n          18    general anesthesia under any circumstances unless he's  \n \n          19    going to undergo a considerable amount of training. \n \n          20    Q    So is there significant risk, therefore, that inmates  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 61of 125\n \n          21    will suffer excruciating pain? \n \n          22    A    Yes, there is. \n \n          23    Q    And do you believe that entrusting John Doe One with  \n \n          24    responsibility for the femoral catheterization procedure  \n \n          25    also creates a significant risk that inmates will suffer  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              66 \n \n \n \n           1    pain from the procedure? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    Okay.  Now I'd like to talk with you a little bit  \n \n           4    about the drug delivery system that's maintained in  \n \n           5    Missouri at Bonne Terre.   \n \n           6              THE REPORTER:  Ms. Anders, I need to change  \n \n           7    paper. \n \n           8              THE COURT:  Why don't we take a recess, about ten \n \n           9    minutes.  Give you a chance to stand and stretch a little. \n \n          10                          (Recess) \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, just very quickly I'd  \n \n          12    like to ask if it's okay with the court if the expert  \n \n          13    witnesses sit in on the testimony.  I think the parties  \n \n          14    have agreed that would be okay, and I'm very sorry.  I  \n \n          15    think we misunderstood. \n \n          16              THE COURT:  If there is an agreement there, I  \n \n          17    don't have a problem. \n \n          18              MR. HAWKE:  There is.  It's no problem. \n \n          19              MR. PRITCHETT:  Just so it's clear, the agreement  \n \n          20    included Mr. Moore could come in as well. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  I kind of figured.  \n \n          22    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  I'd like to talk with you about your  \n \n          23    inspection of the execution facility at Bonne Terre and the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 62of 125\n \n          24    drug delivery system used by the Missouri execution team.   \n \n          25    I believe you testified before that as part of your  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              67 \n \n \n \n           1    participation in the execution system you observed the  \n \n           2    equipment as well as the facility itself; is that correct? \n \n           3    A    That's correct. \n \n           4    Q    And did you draw any conclusions with respect to  \n \n           5    whether the drug delivery system allows the execution team  \n \n           6    to ensure a humane execution?   \n \n           7              MR. HAWKE:  Objection, Your Honor.  This line of  \n \n           8    questioning is beyond the scope of the Court of Appeals'  \n \n           9    remand.  The issues before the court concern the efficacy  \n \n          10    and humaneness of the three-drug protocol as well as the  \n \n          11    use of the femoral access.  It does not involve drug  \n \n          12    delivery systems and things like that. \n \n          13              MS. ANDERS:  Dr. Heath testified before that  \n \n          14    components of the execution procedure include the manner in  \n \n          15    which the drugs are delivered into the inmate, and a large  \n \n          16    part of the issue here is whether the anesthetic can be  \n \n          17    successfully delivered into the inmate's circulation.  So  \n \n          18    because of that, the drug delivery system is very, very  \n \n          19    relevant. \n \n          20              THE COURT:  I agree.  Objection is overruled. \n \n          21    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Dr. Heath, did you draw any  \n \n          22    conclusions with respect to whether the drug delivery  \n \n          23    system allows the execution team to ensure an humane  \n \n          24    execution? \n \n          25    A    I did, yes. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              68 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 63of 125\n \n \n \n           1    Q    And what are your conclusions? \n \n           2    A    There are several problems with the layout in the  \n \n           3    execution chamber and the drug preparation room or the work  \n \n           4    room that's right next to the execution chamber.  The drugs  \n \n           5    are delivered from one room through a wall into the room  \n \n           6    where the prisoner is and the IV tubing disappears into a  \n \n           7    hole in a desk and goes down under that desk and out  \n \n           8    through the wall and then runs along the bed underneath the  \n \n           9    sheet so one cannot survey as is necessary the tubing  \n \n          10    through which the drugs are supposed to flow. \n \n          11    Q    So I believe it's implicit in your answer, but does  \n \n          12    the execution team administer the drugs from a different  \n \n          13    room? \n \n          14    A    Yes, they're standing in one room, and in a completely  \n \n          15    separate isolated room is the prisoner who is being  \n \n          16    executed.   \n \n          17    Q    When, if ever, do anesthesiologists induce general  \n \n          18    anesthesia from a remote location? \n \n          19    A    One would never induce general anesthesia from a  \n \n          20    remote location.  That would be completely, deeply beneath  \n \n          21    any reasonable standard of care. \n \n          22    Q    Does remote induction of general anesthesia create a  \n \n          23    risk of improper anesthetization? \n \n          24    A    Yes, it does.  One is unable, if one is in a different  \n \n          25    room, to assess whether one has achieved the desired or  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              69 \n \n \n \n           1    necessary anesthetic depth. \n \n           2    Q    Why is it -- what does monitoring anesthetic depth  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 64of 125\n \n           3    entail? \n \n           4    A    It's a very complicated thing.  It's essential for an  \n \n           5    anesthesiologist to do.  It involves integrating an array  \n \n           6    of different information from monitors, from different  \n \n           7    monitors, from what the patient is doing, and being able to  \n \n           8    touch the patient and perform various tests. \n \n           9    Q    And why is it necessary to monitor anesthetic depth? \n \n          10    A    Because anesthetic depth is not something that one can  \n \n          11    predict based on what one has done, so we give -- what we  \n \n          12    do is we do what's called titrating for effect.  It's  \n \n          13    like somebody who is trying to get a certain level of  \n \n          14    intoxication from alcohol.  They drink a certain amount.   \n \n          15    They see what effect they get and then they drink however  \n \n          16    much more they need to get to where they want to be. \n \n          17              Anesthesiologists are doing the same thing.   \n \n          18    We're giving drugs and we don't know exactly what they're  \n \n          19    going to do to any individual when you give the amount that  \n \n          20    we need to give to get an effect.  And if we don't have  \n \n          21    that effect, then we continuously adjust that so we know  \n \n          22    how much more or less we need to give and we need to have  \n \n          23    some way of knowing how deep their level of anesthesia is. \n \n          24    Q    Is it necessary to monitor anesthetic depth even when  \n \n          25    a large dose of thiopental is being given? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              70 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, it's always necessary to monitor anesthetic depth  \n \n           2    when you're using intravenous anesthetic drugs.  With the  \n \n           3    gases that people inhale for anesthesia, we can actually  \n \n           4    measure how much gas they're breathing in and breathing out  \n \n           5    and that tells us in real time how much drug is present in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 65of 125\n \n           6    their body.  But with intravenous anesthetics we don't have  \n \n           7    any, unfortunately, have any tests or devices or machines  \n \n           8    that tell us the concentration of drug in the body, so we  \n \n           9    have to do the next best thing which is rely on different  \n \n          10    monitors and other tests and to integrate that information  \n \n          11    in a continuous real time basis to come up with our best  \n \n          12    estimate of what the anesthetic depth is.   \n \n          13    Q    And so is there any other way besides monitoring  \n \n          14    anesthetic depth to determine that the entire intended dose  \n \n          15    of anesthetic has been delivered and has the desired  \n \n          16    effect? \n \n          17    A    No.  We think we're getting a certain amount of the  \n \n          18    drug, but we don't know that for sure unless -- we don't  \n \n          19    know that we have given the right amount, that it's  \n \n          20    successfully entered the circulation until we test or  \n \n          21    assess what the result was, and that's why it's always  \n \n          22    important to test anesthetic depth before initiating any  \n \n          23    painful or uncomfortable procedure. \n \n          24    Q    And so is it necessary to monitor anesthetic depth  \n \n          25    even if there is no need to bring the inmate out of the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              71 \n \n \n \n           1    anesthesia? \n \n           2    A    It's important for you to know that for a humane  \n \n           3    execution to take place.  If you care about that, then you  \n \n           4    have to in some way assess and show that a surgical plane  \n \n           5    of anesthesia, which is a deep enough level of anesthesia  \n \n           6    that you could do surgery on a person and it wouldn't cause  \n \n           7    them pain or suffering.  So if you want to know that it's  \n \n           8    humane, you need to show that there is a surgical plane of  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 66of 125\n \n           9    anesthesia. \n \n          10    Q    Based on your observation during your inspection of  \n \n          11    the execution facility, does the execution team's vantage  \n \n          12    point in another room allow them to monitor anesthetic  \n \n          13    depth? \n \n          14    A    No.  They only have one -- they have two monitors, but  \n \n          15    only one useful monitor for assessing anesthetic depth and  \n \n          16    that's the monitor giving them the heart rate information  \n \n          17    and that's a monitor that can be used, when integrated with  \n \n          18    many other monitors, other medical signs, to give  \n \n          19    indication of anesthetic depth.  But they can't, as we need  \n \n          20    to be, be physically in contact with the patient, standing  \n \n          21    right by their head and able to test various reflexes and  \n \n          22    do tests along those lines.  And they don't have other  \n \n          23    monitors like blood pressure and other things that we use.   \n \n          24    So from where they are, they cannot make any meaningful  \n \n          25    determination of anesthetic depth. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              72 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Can a heart rate monitor alone give you a meaningful  \n \n           2    reading or meaningful sense of anesthetic depth? \n \n           3    A    Not by itself.  It's one of many different monitors  \n \n           4    and clinical signs that we continuously integrate.  We  \n \n           5    continuously absorb that stream of information from many  \n \n           6    sources and use it to synthesize our assessment of what the  \n \n           7    anesthetic depth is.  \n \n           8    Q    And how does the execution team visually observe the  \n \n           9    inmate? \n \n          10    A    They're standing in a different room.  There is a  \n \n          11    window between the execution room and the -- I'm sorry,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 67of 125\n \n          12    there is a window between the room where the executioners  \n \n          13    are standing and where the prisoner is lying on the bed.   \n \n          14    So they're looking down with a view from the head of the  \n \n          15    prisoner down towards his feet. \n \n          16    Q    While at the inspection, did you perform a simulation  \n \n          17    to determine what view the execution team had through the  \n \n          18    window into the execution chamber? \n \n          19    A    Yes.  We had one of the people who was present lay  \n \n          20    down on the bed that's used at the executions and then the  \n \n          21    door to the execution chamber was closed and everybody went  \n \n          22    into the work room where they inject the drugs from and the  \n \n          23    camera person stood at each of the locations where each of  \n \n          24    the executioners were standing to record a video version of  \n \n          25    the view that they would have during the execution. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              73 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And could you describe the view through the window? \n \n           2    A    Well, it's difficult to describe.  Maybe a picture  \n \n           3    would help.  But you're looking down from the head of the  \n \n           4    prisoner towards his feet and all you can see is the top of  \n \n           5    his head or a very shallow view of his face.  And then  \n \n           6    you're looking through a venetian blind, a screen that  \n \n           7    partly obstructs the view.  And then the window is also --  \n \n           8    it's a one-way mirror, a partly silvered mirror, so -- a  \n \n           9    window, so I think it's kind of like looking through  \n \n          10    sunglasses.  It obstructs some of the flow of the light.   \n \n          11    Q    I'd like the record to show I'm showing opposing  \n \n          12    counsel what has been marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 29. \n \n          13              Do you recognize this scene, Dr. Heath? \n \n          14    A    Yes, I do. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 68of 125\n \n          15    Q    And what is it? \n \n          16    A    This is a picture taken by the video filmer of one of  \n \n          17    the people who was present at the inspection and he's lying  \n \n          18    on the bed that's used for the executions and he's covered  \n \n          19    with a sheet, which is how the prison personnel describe  \n \n          20    the execution being done.  And to his -- to the right of  \n \n          21    his head you can see a window and I believe that's where  \n \n          22    some of the witnesses sit.  I'm not sure if it's the  \n \n          23    official witnesses or family members.  And then to the left  \n \n          24    of his head, which is sort of above his head, is a window  \n \n          25    that leads into a different room where the execution  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              74 \n \n \n \n           1    personnel and the physician and other individuals are  \n \n           2    present. \n \n           3              You can see under that window there's a hole in  \n \n           4    the wall and IV tubing coming out from that hole and under  \n \n           5    the sheet, and then it runs into the groin of the condemned  \n \n           6    prisoner.  So that IV tubing was set up to simulate -- set  \n \n           7    up by the prison personnel to show how things are set up  \n \n           8    during an execution. \n \n           9    Q    So based on your observation during the execution  \n \n          10    chamber tour, this is an accurate rendition of the view on  \n \n          11    the gurney? \n \n          12    A    This is what we saw on the tour, and the prison  \n \n          13    personnel indicated this is how things generally look  \n \n          14    during an actual execution. \n \n          15    Q    Thank you. \n \n          16              MS.

Have you seen this scene before? \n \n          23    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          24    Q    And could you describe what this photo shows? \n \n          25    A    This is a simulation again of the prisoner lying on  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              76 \n \n \n \n           1    the bed or the gurney.  Now, this is in a different room.   \n \n           2    This is in the work room or the room where the executioner  \n \n           3    stands, and it's looking down from where the IV tubing, the  \n \n           4    end of the tubing is and where the drugs are injected from,  \n \n           5    looking down at the top of the person's head.  It would be  \n \n           6    the prisoner's head. \n \n           7    Q    And do you believe that you'd be able to ascertain  \n \n           8    whether general anesthesia has been successfully induced  \n \n           9    using this view? \n \n          10    A    No, you can't make any such assessment. \n \n          11    Q    Why not? \n \n          12    A    You're in a different room.  You can't see the  \n \n          13    person's face well.  The top of the head doesn't really  \n \n          14    show, or doesn't show any indications of whether somebody  \n \n          15    is anesthetized or not.  The face can reveal information  \n \n          16    about that.  You can't see any part of his body, and again,  \n \n          17    there are no -- there aren't the monitors that we normally  \n \n          18    deploy to help us assess anesthetic depth.  And you  \n \n          19    certainly can't touch the person, which is one of the  \n \n          20    important things or methods we have available to us to  \n \n          21    assess anesthetic depth. \n \n          22    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to a statement from  \n \n          23    the John Doe One deposition transcript, page 41, in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 71of 125\n \n          24    response to the question, \"Did you monitor Mr. Gray's  \n \n          25    anesthetic depth during execution?\"  He stated, quote, \"The  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              77 \n \n \n \n           1    only thing that can be monitored is facial expression and  \n \n           2    you can judge when the effect of the drug is accomplished,  \n \n           3    and that can be seen from across the room through a  \n \n           4    window.\" \n \n           5              Do you agree with that statement based on your  \n \n           6    observations of your view into the execution chamber? \n \n           7    A    Well, first of all, you don't have a good view of the  \n \n           8    face.  You certainly don't have the kind of view that you  \n \n           9    would need to monitor facial expression if you're using it  \n \n          10    to monitor anesthetic depth.  But much more importantly,  \n \n          11    he's totally wrong about being able to use facial  \n \n          12    expression in this context to monitor anesthetic depth.  If  \n \n          13    the thiopental didn't work properly, when the pancuronium  \n \n          14    goes in, it will cause a relaxed facial expression, similar  \n \n          15    or identical to what expression we get with thiopental.  So  \n \n          16    from being -- even if one were standing right next to the  \n \n          17    person, the rapid onset of pancuronium and the rapid onset  \n \n          18    of thiopental would be very similar. \n \n          19    Q    And based on your observation of the IV tubing, is it  \n \n          20    possible to monitor the flow of drugs through the IV? \n \n          21    A    No.  You only see a very small part of the IV, maybe  \n \n          22    and few inches where it comes out of the hole in the desk,  \n \n          23    and you can't see any of the rest of the extent of the IV.   \n \n          24    Most importantly, you can't see the connection where the IV  \n \n          25    plugs into the triple lumen catheter.  That's underneath  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              78 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 72of 125\n \n \n \n           1    the blanket or the sheet.   \n \n           2    Q    So if the IV tubing can't be seen, are there potential  \n \n           3    problems that could arise with the IV tubing that cannot be  \n \n           4    detected? \n \n           5    A    Yes.  It can disconnect or partly disconnect and leak.   \n \n           6    It can have a hole in it.  It can kink.  There are numerous  \n \n           7    problems.  And that's why it's our standard of care when  \n \n           8    we're inducing general anesthesia in a patient whenever  \n \n           9    possible to have the full extent of the IV tubing  \n \n          10    completely visible and laid out in a neat fashion so that  \n \n          11    we can clearly see that the conduit through which the drugs  \n \n          12    will flow is working properly. \n \n          13    Q    And based on your observation of the IV tubing, do you  \n \n          14    know whether the execution team uses an IV bag or drip? \n \n          15    A    They do not use an IV bag or drip.  They just inject  \n \n          16    straight into the end of the IV tubing. \n \n          17    Q    Is it standard medical practice to use an IV bag and  \n \n          18    drip of saline or other solution when inducing general  \n \n          19    anesthesia? \n \n          20    A    Yes.  What we normally do is connect a bag with a drip  \n \n          21    chamber so we can see the rate of fluid as it enters the IV  \n \n          22    and when we introduce the drugs into the IV line, we can  \n \n          23    see that the fluid is flowing properly. \n \n          24    Q    So to your knowledge, does any other state not use an  \n \n          25    IV bag in its execution procedure? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              79 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Everywhere else that I'm aware of, unless they have  \n \n           2    made a recent change that I'm not aware of, does use IV  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 73of 125\n \n           3    bags. \n \n           4    Q    When you are injecting drugs through IV tubing, are  \n \n           5    there any tactile clues that can help you ascertain whether  \n \n           6    the drugs are flowing properly? \n \n           7    A    Yes.  There is a thing that we call back pressure.   \n \n           8    When you are pushing on the plunger of the syringe, there  \n \n           9    is a certain amount of resistance to pushing that plunger  \n \n          10    in, and it depends on many factors.  If there's just air in  \n \n          11    the syringe, you can push that plunger very easily.  If  \n \n          12    there is fluid in the syringe, then you have to push  \n \n          13    harder.  And it depends on the viscosity of the fluid.  And  \n \n          14    if it's connected to an IV tubing into a catheter, then one  \n \n          15    needs to push even harder. \n \n          16              And we learn from experience what the normal feel  \n \n          17    of that pressure is for a given size syringe, and if we're  \n \n          18    not feeling that normal feeling that's one of the  \n \n          19    indications that we have that something is going wrong with  \n \n          20    the injection.  It's hard to describe in words.  Sort of  \n \n          21    like riding a bicycle.  It's something you need to get a  \n \n          22    feel for, how a plunger should normally feel. \n \n          23    Q    So how does a person acquire that feel for the back  \n \n          24    pressure?  \n \n          25    A    The way you learn that something is going wrong is  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              80 \n \n \n \n           1    if you have -- over time from learning how to inject drugs  \n \n           2    and how to induce anesthesia, one has bedside experience in  \n \n           3    giving the drugs and seeing what happens.  And sometimes we  \n \n           4    do have an infiltration or a problem or a leakage, and, for  \n \n           5    example, if you're injecting and there's a leakage, things  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 74of 125\n \n           6    won't feel right and you'll see a leakage and you connect  \n \n           7    that in your brain and you know in the future when things  \n \n           8    don't feel right that maybe that's what the problem is. \n \n           9    Q    Do the persons who inject the drugs have any medical  \n \n          10    training? \n \n          11    A    Apparently not. \n \n          12    Q    And do they perform rehearsals or train in pushing the  \n \n          13    syringes, based on your review of the documents? \n \n          14    A    No, they don't.  There are some states where there  \n \n          15    is rigorous training protocols where the guards or the  \n \n          16    injection personnel are timed injecting the syringe at a  \n \n          17    certain rate and knowing what the feel -- what the back  \n \n          18    pressure feels like.  But there is no indication that  \n \n          19    that's been done here. \n \n          20    Q    And are rehearsals important to the execution  \n \n          21    procedure? \n \n          22    A    Yes, it is very important.  One needs to have a  \n \n          23    protocol and one needs to rehearse that protocol because  \n \n          24    several people are involved in effecting the execution.   \n \n          25    It's a series of steps that have to be taken in the right  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              81 \n \n \n \n           1    order and the right way.  Everybody has to know what their  \n \n           2    responsibilities are and where to stand.  And the rehearsal  \n \n           3    process allows a quality assurance.  It allows one to work  \n \n           4    out the kinks and the bugs that are inevitably present in a  \n \n           5    complex endeavor. \n \n           6    Q    Based on your observations of the execution chamber,  \n \n           7    is it possible to see the catheter site? \n \n           8    A    No.  That's covered up by the sheet that's placed over  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 75of 125\n \n           9    the prisoner. \n \n          10    Q    So if the catheter had infiltrated would the execution  \n \n          11    team be able to detect it? \n \n          12    A    By infiltration you mean if the fluid was leaving the  \n \n          13    catheter and not going into the vein, what we call  \n \n          14    extravascular position of the catheter tip, they would not  \n \n          15    be able to see that in this configuration. \n \n          16    Q    And if a large hematoma had formed, would the  \n \n          17    execution team be able to detect it? \n \n          18    A    Not in this configuration unless the sheet became  \n \n          19    blood-soaked.  That might give them a clue that something  \n \n          20    was going wrong, but that would require the blood to  \n \n          21    actually be leaving the body as opposed to collecting  \n \n          22    inside the body in a hematoma. \n \n          23    Q    I'd like to draw your attention to a statement from  \n \n          24    the transcript of John Doe One's testimony in his  \n \n          25    deposition, page 31 of the transcript, he states, \"The  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              82 \n \n \n \n           1    people who do the injections are nonmedical and they're in  \n \n           2    the dark so they have a small flashlight that they're able  \n \n           3    to quickly identify the syringes.\"  Does injecting the  \n \n           4    drugs in the dark create a risk of mistakenly injecting the  \n \n           5    syringes in the wrong order?  \n \n           6    A    Yes.  That's a ridiculous thing that they're being  \n \n           7    asked to work in this encumbered or hindered situation  \n \n           8    where they don't have good visibility of what they're  \n \n           9    doing.  That's a completely needless set-up for a problem. \n \n          10    Q    So in general, do the problems in monitoring the  \n \n          11    inmate for anesthetic depth exacerbate the risk that  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 76of 125\n \n          12    complications could go undetected? \n \n          13    A    Yes, they do. \n \n          14    Q    Does the inability of the execution team to detect  \n \n          15    problems or complications exacerbate a risk that a mistake  \n \n          16    by John Doe One or any other member of the team could go  \n \n          17    undetected? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    So is it your -- do you have an opinion as to whether  \n \n          20    the drug delivery system used by Missouri creates a  \n \n          21    significant risk of pain to the inmate? \n \n          22    A    It does, a significant and needless remedial risk. \n \n          23    Q    Assuming that the doctor -- John Doe One's discretion  \n \n          24    is in the future limited and he is required to give five  \n \n          25    grams of thiopental, does that allay your concerns  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              83 \n \n \n \n           1    regarding the doctor's lack of qualifications to induce  \n \n           2    anesthesia? \n \n           3    A    No, it doesn't.  First of all, my understanding is  \n \n           4    that ultimately the warden or the director of the  \n \n           5    Department of Corrections is responsible for all --  \n \n           6    everything that happens regarding an execution, including  \n \n           7    the details.  But the doctor has said that he's the person,  \n \n           8    the only person they have to advise him about any of  \n \n           9    this -- of these features of the execution, of any of the  \n \n          10    medical aspects, so it's pretty clear that any directive  \n \n          11    that would come from the higher-level person would be  \n \n          12    initiated by the doctor himself.  So it's just sort of a  \n \n          13    bureaucratic work-around and it leaves him basically as the  \n \n          14    sole person who is guiding what's occurring. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 77of 125\n \n          15              And as we have discussed, he's completely lacking  \n \n          16    in the credentials and qualifications and knowledge, skill  \n \n          17    set and experience to be entrusted with the delivery of  \n \n          18    general anesthesia, especially in an incredibly important  \n \n          19    thing like an execution. \n \n          20    Q    And does determining the intended dose of thiopental  \n \n          21    ensure that that is the dose that will be delivered  \n \n          22    successfully into circulation? \n \n          23    A    I'm sorry.  Could you ask that again?  \n \n          24    Q    Does determining with certainty what the intended dose  \n \n          25    of thiopental is, does that guarantee that that intended  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              84 \n \n \n \n           1    dose will be delivered successfully into the circulation? \n \n           2    A    No.  You could be intending to give five grams, you  \n \n           3    could be intending to give 50 grams, it doesn't really  \n \n           4    matter.  When you give intravenous drugs you need to  \n \n           5    undertake some independent method of assessing what the  \n \n           6    effects of that intended dose is and find out what in fact  \n \n           7    actually happened.  That's absolutely essential. \n \n           8    Q    Earlier you testified about the components of a  \n \n           9    written execution protocol.  Is a directive that specifies  \n \n          10    the dosage of the drugs the equivalent, in your opinion, of  \n \n          11    a written execution protocol? \n \n          12    A    No.  It's more like you're saying it's a list that  \n \n          13    says the name of a drug and the dose of the drug.  That's  \n \n          14    just a list of ingredients.  What you really need is a full  \n \n          15    protocol that lays out in clear and concise detailed  \n \n          16    instructions everything that needs to happen.

No other state to my  \n \n          25    knowledge proceeds by putting a femoral line or a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              85 \n \n \n \n           1    subclavian line in a person when a peripheral IV catheter  \n \n           2    placement can be achieved.  So he should not -- he's just  \n \n           3    made, I think, too many mistakes and he shouldn't be  \n \n           4    entrusted with any part of this process. \n \n           5    Q    Are there complications that can arise during any part  \n \n           6    of the execution that would require a doctor to make quick  \n \n           7    decisions using his medical judgment? \n \n           8    A    Oh, sure.  Sometimes things go wrong when we're  \n \n           9    inducing general anesthesia, just like they can go wrong  \n \n          10    when the plane is taking off or whatever, and you want the  \n \n          11    pilot of the plane and you want the anesthesiologist to be  \n \n          12    nimble and adept in figuring out what to do, and that  \n \n          13    includes making on-the-fly-calculations and understanding  \n \n          14    doses of drugs. \n \n          15              This doctor in his deposition basically said he'd  \n \n          16    have a hard time doing this stuff.  He has his nurses help  \n \n          17    him out with these things, and he's no good with numbers.   \n \n          18    If he can't do his cable bill, then he should not be  \n \n          19    charged with making these on-the-fly ad hoc changes that  \n \n          20    sometimes a doctor would need to make inducing and  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 79of 125\n \n          21    maintaining general anesthesia. \n \n          22    Q    So then given that John Doe One would still be  \n \n          23    participating in or overseeing the execution procedures, or  \n \n          24    assuming that he would be, do you still think there would  \n \n          25    be a significant risk of unnecessary pain in the execution  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              86 \n \n \n \n           1    procedure? \n \n           2    A    Yes, I do.   \n \n           3              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, if I could have a  \n \n           4    moment. \n \n           5              That concludes my direct examination, Your Honor,  \n \n           6    but I'd just like to confirm that the Exhibits 1 through  \n \n           7    23, which are the discovery materials, have been admitted  \n \n           8    into evidence. \n \n           9              THE COURT:  Those are the ones agreed upon in  \n \n          10    advance?  \n \n          11              MR. HAWKE:  Yes, Your Honor. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Okay. \n \n          13              MS. ANDERS:  The photo stills that we showed from  \n \n          14    the video, we separately marked those as exhibits.  Would  \n \n          15    it be acceptable if we enter those into evidence, just for  \n \n          16    convenience? \n \n          17              THE COURT:  I have no problem with that.  They  \n \n          18    are part of the video anyway. \n \n          19              MR. HAWKE:  No objection. \n \n          20              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you.    \n \n          21    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HAWKE:  \n \n          22    Q    Can you describe for the record what the execution  \n \n          23    chamber at the Eastern Reception and Diagnostic Center  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 80of 125\n \n          24    looks like? \n \n          25    A    The chamber itself, or the overall layout of all the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              87 \n \n \n \n           1    rooms? \n \n           2    Q    The chamber itself. \n \n           3    A    It's a room, I'd make a very broad estimate, of maybe  \n \n           4    twenty feet by twelve feet or something along those lines.   \n \n           5    There's very little in the room.  The main thing is the bed  \n \n           6    that the prisoner is placed on, and I believe there are  \n \n           7    windows on all four walls of that room and I believe there  \n \n           8    were I think at least two doors to that room, one going to  \n \n           9    a work room where the executioners stand and one I think  \n \n          10    leading to the area where the prisoner -- the holding cell  \n \n          11    where he's kept before the execution. \n \n          12    Q    And is the room constructed of block material,  \n \n          13    concrete block material? \n \n          14    A    I'm sorry.  I don't recall what the construction was.   \n \n          15    I think the walls might have been painted, so I'm not sure  \n \n          16    what it was made of. \n \n          17    Q    And can you describe -- I believe you said during  \n \n          18    direct examination there was a window between the execution  \n \n          19    chamber and what was described as the execution support  \n \n          20    room? \n \n          21    A    Yes, sir, there is. \n \n          22    Q    What was the size of the window between those two  \n \n          23    rooms? \n \n          24              THE COURT:  Get to the point here, because we  \n \n          25    already know, it's a matter of record what it looks like,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              88 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 81of 125\n \n \n \n           1    Mr. Hawke.  If you have a specific question, get to that  \n \n           2    question. \n \n           3    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Would you describe that window as a  \n \n           4    large window? \n \n           5    A    Yes, it's a full-sized window. \n \n           6    Q    And I believe you said that there were blinds on that  \n \n           7    window? \n \n           8    A    There's a venetian blind, yes. \n \n           9              THE COURT:  Is this the window here (indicating)? \n \n          10              THE WITNESS:  Yes.  You have the picture where I  \n \n          11    can see the top of his head? \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Yes.  \n \n          13              THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's the window. \n \n          14    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  And when you're in the execution  \n \n          15    support room you can view what is occurring in the  \n \n          16    execution chamber through that window? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \n \n          18    Q    With the limitations you described during direct  \n \n          19    examination.  \n \n          20    A    That's correct. \n \n          21    Q    And I believe the photograph reflects that there are  \n \n          22    thin black lines where the venetian blinds are? \n \n          23    A    Yes, the slats of the blind are there, yes. \n \n          24    Q    But the offender can still be observed through that  \n \n          25    blind? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              89 \n \n \n \n           1    A    There's a limited ability to observe, yes.  It's \n \n           2    partly obscured by the things that I talked about.  And if  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 82of 125\n \n           3    I could just clarify, the blinds are at an angle so one's  \n \n           4    head has to be at just the right height to be able to see  \n \n           5    the prisoner's face, so one has to be standing in just the  \n \n           6    right place.  So for some people, depending on their height  \n \n           7    and where they're standing, their view would be more  \n \n           8    obscured than others because of the angle of the slats of  \n \n           9    the venetian blind.  It can only be -- its maximal  \n \n          10    transparency is only present at one angle.   \n \n          11    Q    Do you know what the purpose of the blinds is? \n \n          12    A    We were told during the tour.  We were given a reason  \n \n          13    for their presence, yes. \n \n          14    Q    What was the reason? \n \n          15    A    We were told that there are witnesses in the opposite  \n \n          16    side of the -- in the room that's opposite the work room  \n \n          17    and that there's a concern that those witnesses would be  \n \n          18    able to see through the window, even though it's a one-way  \n \n          19    mirrored window, and see what's happening in that room and  \n \n          20    they would be able to identify the individuals who were  \n \n          21    standing there.  And it's a needless concern because when  \n \n          22    I stood in that same room we played with the blinds and  \n \n          23    regardless of the configuration of the blinds, you can't  \n \n          24    see the people who are in there.  And even if you could,  \n \n          25    that situation could easily be remedied by having them wear  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              90 \n \n \n \n           1    surgical masks or something else that would obscure their  \n \n           2    identity.   \n \n           3    Q    A disguise?   \n \n           4    A    Well, a disguise implies making them look like  \n \n           5    somebody else.  I'm talking about something that would  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 83of 125\n \n           6    make them unable to see who they are.  That can easily be  \n \n           7    achieved. \n \n           8    Q    Now, I believe you testified during direct  \n \n           9    examination that the tubing between the execution support  \n \n          10    chamber and the condemned could not be observed.  \n \n          11    A    Large parts of it cannot be observed.  The end of it  \n \n          12    can be observed where one injects the drug. \n \n          13    Q    So in the area that we're describing as the execution  \n \n          14    support room, the tubing can be observed? \n \n          15    A    A very small tip of the end of it.  If you're talking  \n \n          16    about a snake, it's like seeing just the very tail of that  \n \n          17    snake.  So, yes, I suppose you could say that you're  \n \n          18    observing the tubing, but you're not observing the tubing  \n \n          19    in its full extent. \n \n          20    Q    Now -- and the people who do the injection of the  \n \n          21    drugs observe the syringe; is that correct? \n \n          22    A    I'm not sure I'd describe it as observing.  It's a  \n \n          23    darkened room, but they do have their hands on the syringe  \n \n          24    and they're getting some tactile feedback in terms of back  \n \n          25    pressure on the plunger.  I don't know if they're looking  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              91 \n \n \n \n           1    at the prisoner or if they're looking at the syringe, so I  \n \n           2    don't want to characterize exactly what they're observing. \n \n           3    Q    And how many people are in this area that is capable  \n \n           4    of observing the offender during an execution? \n \n           5    A    Whomever is standing looking at this picture, that's  \n \n           6    the window there, and in front of them is a bench at about  \n \n           7    waist height and I believe that there's a line of three  \n \n           8    people standing pretty much shoulder-to-shoulder because  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 84of 125\n \n           9    it's a small space behind that bench.  And then also to the  \n \n          10    right-hand side of the bench, on the end of the bench, is  \n \n          11    another individual.  And then there's the physician who I  \n \n          12    understand stands behind those three people but might also  \n \n          13    move around.  His position is less fixed.  And then it's  \n \n          14    not clear to me, I think there's the John Doe Two, the  \n \n          15    nurse who participates in the execution, and I'm not sure  \n \n          16    where that individual stands, or if they are one of those  \n \n          17    people. \n \n          18    Q    Okay.  Now, you testified during direct examination  \n \n          19    that you would not induce anesthesia from a remote  \n \n          20    location; is that correct? \n \n          21    A    I have tried to think of circumstances where that  \n \n          22    might happen.  It's very hard to come up with a realistic  \n \n          23    one where that would be needed. \n \n          24    Q    And when you testified to that effect, I assume what  \n \n          25    you are describing there you would not induce anesthesia  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              92 \n \n \n \n           1    for the purpose of surgery from a remote location; is that  \n \n           2    correct? \n \n           3    A    For any purpose. \n \n           4    Q    For any purpose.  But what you're basing that on is  \n \n           5    your experience as an anesthesiologist who induces  \n \n           6    anesthesia for the purpose of surgery; is that correct? \n \n           7    A    Well, we induce anesthesia for other reasons in  \n \n           8    addition to surgery, but if you're saying I'm basing it on  \n \n           9    my clinical experience and training, then that would be  \n \n          10    correct. \n \n          11    Q    And you have not participated as a person involved in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 85of 125\n \n          12    the preparation and planning of an execution? \n \n          13    A    I have not. \n \n          14    Q    Now -- \n \n          15    A    If I can clarify that, because I have been involved in  \n \n          16    I wouldn't call it an execution of an animal but the  \n \n          17    euthanasia of an animal by intravenous techniques. \n \n          18    Q    But that's not what is being done here; is that  \n \n          19    correct? \n \n          20    A    No.  What is being done here is not done to the same  \n \n          21    standard as what is being done to an animal during  \n \n          22    euthanasia. \n \n          23    Q    And this is not surgery, is it? \n \n          24    A    There is a surgical procedure that's already taken  \n \n          25    place with the placement of the central line. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              93 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    But that's already passed.  \n \n           2    A    That's right. \n \n           3    Q    Now, you stated during direct examination that you  \n \n           4    would always want to monitor the depth of anesthesia; is  \n \n           5    that correct? \n \n           6    A    When administering anesthesia one does need to monitor  \n \n           7    its depth, yes. \n \n           8    Q    And you base that upon your clinical practice? \n \n           9    A    Yes, and my practice during animal research and also  \n \n          10    during my research about lethal injection. \n \n          11    Q    Now, can you describe for the court why that is  \n \n          12    necessary, or is that necessary when a massive dose of  \n \n          13    sodium pentothal is given as the initial drug? \n \n          14    A    It's necessary because while I may be intending, and I  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 86of 125\n \n          15    believe there is an intent to give a massive dose, I'm very  \n \n          16    comfortable that it was John Doe One's intent to give these  \n \n          17    multi-gram doses, call them massive doses, just because  \n \n          18    that intent exists does not mean that translates into the  \n \n          19    successful delivery into the prisoner's circulation and  \n \n          20    delivered to the brain of that dose of thiopental. \n \n          21    Q    And I believe during direct examination you used the  \n \n          22    example of alcohol, drinking; is that correct? \n \n          23    A    I think I was using that as an example of what we call  \n \n          24    titrating effects.  I was trying to describe how a person  \n \n          25    intoxicates themselves to a desired level by drinking a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              94 \n \n \n \n           1    certain amount and seeing what effect it has and then  \n \n           2    drinking more. \n \n           3    Q    And if an individual were to consume, for example,  \n \n           4    five cases of beer, would you need to observe that  \n \n           5    individual drinking before classifying that person as  \n \n           6    drunk? \n \n           7    A    Absolutely. \n \n           8    Q    So you would want to actually see him do the drinking  \n \n           9    rather than categorize him as drunk after his ingestion of  \n \n          10    five cases? \n \n          11    A    Well, again to characterize somebody as drunk you have  \n \n          12    to either do a behavioral test to show that they're  \n \n          13    intoxicated, I think that's what the police officers do on  \n \n          14    the roadside, sobriety test I think it's called, or you  \n \n          15    have to undertake some chemical measurement like a  \n \n          16    breathalyzer test to show the alcohol is there.  So if you  \n \n          17    drink five cases of beer, it could be non-alcoholic beer  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 87of 125\n \n          18    like the beer I had last night and I wouldn't expect them  \n \n          19    in any way to be intoxicated from that. \n \n          20    Q    So your testimony today is that a dosing of five  \n \n          21    grams of sodium pentothal would be insufficient to induce  \n \n          22    anesthesia in Missouri? \n \n          23    A    You are mischaracterizing my testimony. \n \n          24    Q    Did you testify to that effect during direct  \n \n          25    examination? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              95 \n \n \n \n           1    A    That was not my intent to testify to that effect.  My  \n \n           2    intent was to say if one successfully achieves delivery of  \n \n           3    five grams of thiopental into a prisoner's circulation and  \n \n           4    the circulation successfully carries that throughout the  \n \n           5    body, including the brain, then that would be a sufficient \n \n           6    dose to guarantee a surgical plane of anesthesia.  But  \n \n           7    intending to give five grams is not the same as  \n \n           8    successfully achieving the delivery of five grams. \n \n           9    Q    So to make sure I understand, if five grams goes in,  \n \n          10    then that's adequate anesthesia? \n \n          11    A    If five grams, not just goes into the prisoner's body,  \n \n          12    but goes into his circulation and the circulation is active  \n \n          13    and carries it throughout the body including part of it to  \n \n          14    the brain then -- and there is nothing to obstruct the flow  \n \n          15    of blood to the brain, then that would deliver anesthesia. \n \n          16    Q    And if 2.5 grams goes in, would that be sufficient? \n \n          17    A    Yes, that would be.  Again, not just going in, but  \n \n          18    being delivered into the vein and carried by the   \n \n          19    circulation throughout the body. \n \n          20    Q    What number would you say would be insufficient? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 88of 125\n \n          21    A    Well, you can't put a specific number on any  \n \n          22    individual person.  That's enormous person-to-person  \n \n          23    variation and it's in response to many drugs, including  \n \n          24    anesthetic drugs and including thiopental.  So some people,  \n \n          25    just like your beer analogy, can be rendered unconscious by  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              96 \n \n \n \n           1    probably one beer and there are other people who I think  \n \n           2    can drink, I don't know, whatever large amount, like a case  \n \n           3    or something, and still manage to drive a car.  So there's  \n \n           4    enormous variation.  I can't put a specific number on it.   \n \n           5    It depends on other factors like the person's weight,  \n \n           6    whether they have been taking drugs like anti-seizure  \n \n           7    medications or many other drugs, anti-anxiety drugs that  \n \n           8    can affect their resistance to drugs like thiopental. \n \n           9    Q    Have you ever monitored a condemned person during an  \n \n          10    execution? \n \n          11    A    No. \n \n          12    Q    So you have not observed a person being executed who  \n \n          13    was not under the effect of anesthesia, either in Missouri  \n \n          14    or around the country? \n \n          15    A    I have never been present to observe the induction of  \n \n          16    general anesthesia during any execution procedure. \n \n          17    Q    Now, I believe you testified that there was a  \n \n          18    monitoring device at the execution chamber.  Is that an  \n \n          19    EKG monitor? \n \n          20    A    My recollection is there is a thing called a pulse  \n \n          21    oximeter and another device called an EKG which monitors  \n \n          22    the electrical activity of the heart. \n \n          23    Q    And the purpose of that is to determine when the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 89of 125\n \n          24    offender has passed away? \n \n          25    A    I believe that's correct, yes.  It is not being used  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              97 \n \n \n \n           1    to monitor anesthetic depth.   \n \n           2    Q    Up on your computer screen is Exhibit 30.  Do you  \n \n           3    know where in the execution support chamber that picture  \n \n           4    was selected?  Whether that's the position of John Doe One,  \n \n           5    John Doe Two, John Doe Three or John Doe Five? \n \n           6    A    I don't know for sure.  I know it's not -- well, you  \n \n           7    have to understand that the video camera has a zoom  \n \n           8    function, so I can't tell from this picture how far the  \n \n           9    videographer was standing from the window when it was  \n \n          10    taken.  I think it could either be from the person who is  \n \n          11    standing directly behind the bench or it could be from a  \n \n          12    person who is looking over their shoulder or between two of  \n \n          13    the people who are standing behind the bench, but I can't  \n \n          14    say for sure because of that zoom effect. \n \n          15    Q    Now --      \n \n          16    A    But there's a wall behind that area, quite close  \n \n          17    behind it, so they couldn't have been more than probably --   \n \n          18    I'd say that's at most five feet, probably more like four  \n \n          19    feet from the window. \n \n          20    Q    Now, you said that there could be a problem with the  \n \n          21    IV access because it would become disconnected; is that  \n \n          22    right? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    If it becomes disconnected, then none of the drugs  \n \n          25    enter the offender; isn't that correct? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              98 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 90of 125\n \n \n \n           1    A    If it's fully disconnected, then no drug would enter.   \n \n           2    In fact, there would be blood leaking back out of the  \n \n           3    triple lumen catheter.  If it became partially  \n \n           4    disconnected, which is another kind of disconnection,  \n \n           5    then there would be -- one would expect only a partial  \n \n           6    delivery of the drugs. \n \n           7              I'll make this comment.  The way it's set up  \n \n           8    with a mattress is different from other -- many other  \n \n           9    execution chambers.  Other execution chambers just have a  \n \n          10    hard metallic gurney and any leaking would immediately drip  \n \n          11    through onto the floor.  But in this setting there's a  \n \n          12    mattress there that in all likelihood would absorb a \n \n          13    considerable amount of fluid before it showed up on the \n \n          14    floor.  And again, the IV introduction site is deliberately  \n \n          15    kept visible to the personnel so they can see if a leak is  \n \n          16    occurring.  And neither of these conditions are applied  \n \n          17    here. \n \n          18    Q    Now, for it to be disconnected, the entire length of  \n \n          19    the catheter would have to come out of the offender; isn't  \n \n          20    that correct? \n \n          21    A    No, that's incorrect. \n \n          22    Q    So there is a connection between the catheter and the  \n \n          23    tubing that you're saying could become dislodged? \n \n          24    A    That's correct.  There is a piece of tubing, I forget  \n \n          25    how long it was, maybe six or seven or eight feet,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                              99 \n \n \n \n           1    something like that, and then that is attached to the end  \n \n           2    of the triple lumen -- the end that's outside the prisoner  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 91of 125\n \n           3    of the triple lumen catheter. \n \n           4    Q    And if that were to happen, none of the drugs would go  \n \n           5    into the offender; isn't that correct? \n \n           6    A    If there was a partial disconnection, then there would  \n \n           7    be a partial reduction in the delivery of drugs.  If there  \n \n           8    was a complete disconnection, then there would be a  \n \n           9    complete obliteration of all drug delivery. \n \n          10    Q    And similarly, if there is, as you described it, a  \n \n          11    kink in the line, then the drugs, none of the drugs would  \n \n          12    go into the offender; isn't that correct? \n \n          13    A    No, that's not correct. \n \n          14    Q    Okay.  If there's a kink in the line are you saying  \n \n          15    they would go into the offender more slowly? \n \n          16    A    A kink in the line could be a complete obstruction so  \n \n          17    that no drugs could go in, or it could be a partial  \n \n          18    obstruction, increasing resistance.  Just like your garden  \n \n          19    hose, you can kink it so no water comes out the end of it,  \n \n          20    but you can also kink it in a way where the flow is just  \n \n          21    decreased.  So another possibility is if the tubing could  \n \n          22    be kinked.  And the way it's configured, there's a real  \n \n          23    risk of that, and that would increase the resistance to \n \n          24    injecting drugs and it would also interfere with the  \n \n          25    ability to assess the back pressure, which, as I described,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             100 \n \n \n \n           1    is an important thing.   \n \n           2    Q    So when that happens, the person who is doing the  \n \n           3    injection has to plunge harder? \n \n           4    A    My understanding in this context is they are unable to  \n \n           5    plunge harder because they are already plunging as hard as  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 92of 125\n \n           6    they can, so they would be unable to do anything greater  \n \n           7    than what they were already trying to do. \n \n           8    Q    So in that scenario is the effect of the kink the  \n \n           9    drugs would go in more slowly? \n \n          10    A    That's correct. \n \n          11    Q    Now, your understanding of the Missouri protocol is  \n \n          12    that there's one -- is it correct that your understanding  \n \n          13    is that there is the first drug, sodium pentothal, followed  \n \n          14    by a flush, followed by a second drug, Pavalon, followed by  \n \n          15    a flush, followed by the third drug, potassium chloride,  \n \n          16    followed by a flush? \n \n          17    A    Just to clarify, there is no protocol.  But in terms  \n \n          18    of what has been done in the past, that's a fair  \n \n          19    representation of the drug phase.  But as I described, I  \n \n          20    think it's useful to break this whole thing into four  \n \n          21    phases, with the first phase being achieving an IV access,  \n \n          22    and that's something that warrants protocol surrounding  \n \n          23    that.  And then there's the second phase, which is delivery  \n \n          24    of the anesthetic.  The third phase, the paralyzing drug.   \n \n          25    And the fourth phase is the drug that causes death. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             101 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    But that is a correct description of the order that  \n \n           2    the drugs are injected? \n \n           3    A    That's correct, that's the order they're intending to  \n \n           4    inject them. \n \n           5    Q    And if there is a kink in the line, that would not  \n \n           6    change the order of the drugs that are being injected? \n \n           7    A    No, it wouldn't, unless a person said something is  \n \n           8    wrong and stopped and they said we better stop this and  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 93of 125\n \n           9    they went and decided to run a different line of tubing or  \n \n          10    maybe plug it into a different one of the three catheters  \n \n          11    in the triple lumen catheter and they forgot where they  \n \n          12    were, or the syringes got knocked around in that process.   \n \n          13    So there are ways where a kink -- anything that disrupts  \n \n          14    the sequence of injection in an unexpected way can cause  \n \n          15    disorder and, therefore, disrupt the smooth performance of  \n \n          16    the procedure. \n \n          17    Q    And are you telling the court this morning that there  \n \n          18    should be a written protocol that covers all of those  \n \n          19    contingencies? \n \n          20    A    When you have individuals who are not competent or  \n \n          21    qualified to adapt to unexpected events and contingencies,  \n \n          22    then you need to have some written instructions for them  \n \n          23    about what they would need to do. \n \n          24    Q    To cover all contingencies? \n \n          25    A    I think all reasonably foreseeable contingencies.  One  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             102 \n \n \n \n           1    needs to plan properly for an important event like this.   \n \n           2    Obviously there are things that can happen that nobody can  \n \n           3    reasonably expect or anticipate, and that's why in the end  \n \n           4    you also want to have people who are able to adapt. \n \n           5    Q    When you say reasonably foreseeable, what percentage  \n \n           6    of a possibility are you placing on that?  Is it like a one  \n \n           7    percent chance of something happening or a tenth of a  \n \n           8    percent chance of something happening or a hundredth of a  \n \n           9    percent chance of something happening?  What are you  \n \n          10    telling the court? \n \n          11    A    You can't put numbers on it.  It's like teaching  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 94of 125\n \n          12    somebody to drive to be safe to take a motor vehicle on the  \n \n          13    road.  They have learned a lot of procedures as it were,  \n \n          14    how to use their hand brake and how to signal and how to do  \n \n          15    various things.  They learn how to make hand signals if  \n \n          16    their signals go out.  But there are things that you can't  \n \n          17    anticipate, so they need to have a certain demonstrative  \n \n          18    level of training and proficiency in driving a car before  \n \n          19    you allow them to go out on the road.  And there are  \n \n          20    unexpected things that you can't put down in the driver ed  \n \n          21    manual that can happen.  A cow crossing the road, that's  \n \n          22    probably not in the book, but the person needs to be able  \n \n          23    to figure out what to do if a cow crosses the road, that  \n \n          24    there might be other cows coming around and they need to  \n \n          25    slow down and take it easy. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             103 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Now, you state that other states do not use an IV bag,  \n \n           2    is that correct, in their execution protocol? \n \n           3    A    If I stated that, I misspoke.  Other states do use  \n \n           4    IV bags. \n \n           5    Q    And Missouri is the only state that does not? \n \n           6    A    To my knowledge, yes.  I should clarify that while  \n \n           7    most states have revealed their written protocols in some  \n \n           8    cases to the public and in other cases under protective  \n \n           9    orders, not every state has done that. \n \n          10    Q    Now, the reason -- is there a reason that they use an  \n \n          11    IV bag? \n \n          12    A    I'm not inside their head so I don't know what is  \n \n          13    their thinking, but there is a good reason to use IV bags  \n \n          14    for the induction of anesthesia. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 95of 125\n \n          15    Q    Now, in Missouri the execution process is a very quick  \n \n          16    process; isn't that correct? \n \n          17    A    Can you describe quick?  Quick as compared to what?  \n \n          18    Q    Compared to surgery, what you're used to. \n \n          19    A    We're not talking about surgery.  We're talking about  \n \n          20    the induction of general anesthesia, and I'd say within  \n \n          21    boundaries it's approximately the same kind of time frame  \n \n          22    as induction of general anesthesia tends to occur during a  \n \n          23    clinical setting. \n \n          24    Q    Now, assuming that an execution is scheduled at  \n \n          25    midnight, do you recall when the insertion of the catheter  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             104 \n \n \n \n           1    occurs? \n \n           2    A    I'm sorry, I don't recall, but I believe it was in a  \n \n           3    relatively short time frame beforehand.  It was not the day  \n \n           4    before or anything like that. \n \n           5    Q    And the purpose of using the catheter would be -- is  \n \n           6    only for the execution; is that correct? \n \n           7    A    That's right.  It's not being put in for any  \n \n           8    therapeutic purpose. \n \n           9    Q    So once it's used, there's no further use for it? \n \n          10    A    Once the execution has been achieved? \n \n          11    Q    Yes. \n \n          12    A    Yes.  Assuming the execution is not stayed, assuming  \n \n          13    the execution is actually carried out, then that catheter  \n \n          14    does not serve any useful purpose, although for autopsy  \n \n          15    purposes it's standard procedure to leave all catheters in  \n \n          16    their normal place. \n \n          17    Q    I believe you stated during direct examination that if  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 96of 125\n \n          18    there was leakage, that the syringe -- that the pressure on  \n \n          19    the syringe would not feel right.  Am I summarizing your  \n \n          20    testimony correctly? \n \n          21    A    It might not feel right, that's correct, yes.   \n \n          22    Depending on the leakage and whether there were things like  \n \n          23    kinking or other problems interfering.  And also implicit  \n \n          24    in that, knowing that it would feel right implies that the  \n \n          25    person has in their head a notion of what feeling right and  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             105 \n \n \n \n           1    feeling wrong is.  If they lack that, then there is no feel  \n \n           2    right or feel wrong for them to experience. \n \n           3    Q    Are you familiar with the experience of John Doe Three  \n \n           4    and John Doe Five in the execution process as injectors? \n \n           5    A    I'm sorry, I don't have in my head exactly who -- I  \n \n           6    know who John Doe One is, not who they are but I know what  \n \n           7    their responsibilities are, John Doe One, the physician,  \n \n           8    John Doe Two, the nurse.  But if you could refresh me on  \n \n           9    what John Does Three, Four and Five specifically do.  I  \n \n          10    don't want to confuse the record. \n \n          11    Q    Three and Five are the current injectors.  \n \n          12    A    They're the individuals pushing the drugs? \n \n          13    Q    Yes.  \n \n          14    A    Okay.  \n \n          15    Q    Are you familiar with their experience at doing that  \n \n          16    job? \n \n          17    A    I don't know their life history, how many executions  \n \n          18    they have participated in, how many times they have  \n \n          19    injected through central lines and all of those things, no. \n \n          20              Further, I believe those are just titled  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 97of 125\n \n          21    positions.  They could be occupied by any individual, just  \n \n          22    like the presidency or a senator.  So it's a titled  \n \n          23    position, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, that any individual could  \n \n          24    occupy.  If John Doe Three was sick that day, somebody else  \n \n          25    would step in to fill his place, I believe.  So I don't  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             106 \n \n \n \n           1    know the backgrounds of whomever might be available to step  \n \n           2    in. \n \n           3    Q    Now, the syringes that are used at the execution  \n \n           4    support room, do you recall that those syringes are  \n \n           5    labeled? \n \n           6    A    You'll have to refresh me.  I don't want to confuse  \n \n           7    the record.  I have seen many different methods used in  \n \n           8    different states.  I believe that the name was written on  \n \n           9    the syringe, but I'm not sure whether it was -- a paper  \n \n          10    label was put on or whether it was written directly on the  \n \n          11    syringe, so if you could describe for me what is done, that  \n \n          12    would be helpful. \n \n          13    Q    You don't remember? \n \n          14    A    I don't remember precisely.  I believe they wrote with  \n \n          15    a magic marker on the actual plastic of the syringe. \n \n          16    Q    And do you recall that the syringes are placed on a  \n \n          17    block of wood in a particular order in the execution  \n \n          18    support chamber? \n \n          19    A    Yes, I do recall that there's an especially shaped  \n \n          20    block of wood with concave depressions in it for the  \n \n          21    syringes to lie in. \n \n          22    Q    And they go onto that block of wood in the order in  \n \n          23    which they are to be given; isn't that correct? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 98of 125\n \n          24    A    That's the plan.  That's what is supposed to happen,  \n \n          25    but there is no protocol dictating that. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             107 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    I believe you testified during direct examination, and  \n \n           2    correct me if I'm wrong on that, that even if Missouri  \n \n           3    intended to use 50 grams of sodium pentothal, you would  \n \n           4    still find the Missouri practice to be unacceptable? \n \n           5    A    If that were the only change that were made, yes.   \n \n           6    When you use potassium to kill a person or any animal,  \n \n           7    which is what is being -- what the Department of  \n \n           8    Corrections is choosing to do in this setting, it's  \n \n           9    essential that the person who is performing the  \n \n          10    administration of the potassium, intravenous potassium, is  \n \n          11    experienced in the assessment of anesthetic depth and  \n \n          12    experienced in the administration of intravenous  \n \n          13    anesthetics and, further, that they undertake specific  \n \n          14    tests to ensure that the person or the animal is properly  \n \n          15    anesthetized, they're at a surgical plane of anesthesia.     \n \n          16              So if the only change that were made to Missouri  \n \n          17    protocol were just to increase the dose of thiopental, that  \n \n          18    would still be deeply adequate.  It's very important to  \n \n          19    have a person who knows how to check anesthetic depth, who  \n \n          20    knows how to administer intravenous anesthetics, actually  \n \n          21    go and assess that the animal, if it's a veterinarian  \n \n          22    procedure, or the prisoner in an execution, if you want  \n \n          23    the execution to be humane, they have to assess that the  \n \n          24    surgical plane of anesthesia has been achieved.  If they  \n \n          25    don't do that, it's inadequate. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             108 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 99of 125\n \n \n \n           1    Q    So a massive overdose of the first drug, sodium  \n \n           2    thiopental, is insufficient, in your estimate? \n \n           3    A    The intent to deliver a massive overdose is  \n \n           4    insufficient.  When veterinarians use potassium to put down  \n \n           5    dogs, they have an intent to give a massive overdose of  \n \n           6    barbiturates.  They are also professionals who are trained  \n \n           7    and experienced in the administration of intravenous  \n \n           8    anesthetics.  Even in that setting, even when they're right  \n \n           9    there in the same room, they are required to be  \n \n          10    knowledgeable in assessing anesthetic depth and are  \n \n          11    experienced, and they are required to undertake certain  \n \n          12    tests to demonstrate a surgical plane of anesthesia. \n \n          13              So you can be intending to give any amount of  \n \n          14    thiopental.  It doesn't matter if you're going to use  \n \n          15    potassium to kill an animal or a person, you need to first  \n \n          16    demonstrate a surgical plane of anesthesia.  You need to  \n \n          17    assess anesthetic depth. \n \n          18    Q    So giving a massive overdose is insufficient? \n \n          19    A    Intending to give a massive overdose is insufficient.   \n \n          20    If you successfully achieve delivery into the circulation,  \n \n          21    which is something that can never be assumed with  \n \n          22    intravenous anesthetic, then a 50-gram dose would certainly  \n \n          23    be sufficient, but you can never make that assumption. \n \n          24    Q    Is there any barbiturate that would satisfy you? \n \n          25    A    If one is going to use potassium to cause cardiac  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             109 \n \n \n \n           1    arrest, to achieve the death, then it doesn't matter what  \n \n           2    drug you use to provide the anesthesia or how much you're  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 100of 125\n \n           3    intending to use.  You must assess the anesthetic depth.   \n \n           4    You must demonstrate the animal or the person is in a  \n \n           5    surgical plane of anesthesia, which is a very deep plane of  \n \n           6    anesthesia. \n \n           7    Q    Now, you stated during direct examination that  \n \n           8    Missouri was the only state to use femoral venous access;  \n \n           9    is that correct? \n \n          10    A    If I stated that, that was a misstatement.  It's the  \n \n          11    only state that I'm aware of that does not first attempt to  \n \n          12    obtain peripheral IV access and only proceeds to femoral --  \n \n          13    proceeds to a femoral access in people who do not need  \n \n          14    femoral access. \n \n          15    Q    Now, peripheral access is through the arm, or is it  \n \n          16    through the leg as well? \n \n          17    A    Either one of those would count as peripheral IV  \n \n          18    access.  The hands, the wrists, the arms.  Anything -- I  \n \n          19    don't think there is exactly a bright line, but anything in  \n \n          20    the extremities would count as peripheral access.  And I  \n \n          21    should just say the groin is -- the end of the catheter is  \n \n          22    inside the main part of the body, the trunk of the body,  \n \n          23    and most people would call that peripheral access. \n \n          24    Q    And would you agree, generally speaking, that those  \n \n          25    peripheral veins are the ones that drug addicts use for the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             110 \n \n \n \n           1    injection of illicit drugs? \n \n           2    A    That's right. \n \n           3    Q    And that use of illicit drugs damages those veins? \n \n           4    A    Over time it tends to do that, yes.  It's not just  \n \n           5    drug addicts who have that problem.  It can be people who  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 101of 125\n \n           6    have never used intravenous drugs of abuse. \n \n           7    Q    And would you agree with the statement that use of a  \n \n           8    femoral vein provides an effective access to the venous  \n \n           9    system, to the circulation system? \n \n          10    A    When the catheter is properly placed, it does provide  \n \n          11    effective access, that's right. \n \n          12    Q    And it puts the drugs -- it puts the poisons where  \n \n          13    they need to be, close to the heart; would you agree? \n \n          14    A    Well, first of all, they're not poisons.  They're  \n \n          15    medications.  Secondly, the circulation is what carries  \n \n          16    them where they need to be.  The place where they need to  \n \n          17    be is not close to the heart.  The place where they need to  \n \n          18    be is different for each of those three medications.  The  \n \n          19    thiopental needs to be in the brain and the spinal cord.   \n \n          20    The pancuronium needs to be in the muscles.  And the \n \n          21    potassium needs to be in the heart. The central line does  \n \n          22    not put them close to the heart.  The circulation is what  \n \n          23    brings them to the heart and into the other places. \n \n          24    Q    The central line places the potassium close to the  \n \n          25    heart; would you agree? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             111 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Define close.  What's your definition of close in this  \n \n           2    context? \n \n           3    Q    Why don't you define it for the court? \n \n           4    A    Well, just to clarify, I will say that peripheral IV  \n \n           5    access can be closer to the heart than central IV access.   \n \n           6    A catheter placed in the elbow right here has -- the drug  \n \n           7    would have to travel from about here to the end of the  \n \n           8    catheter, a distance of about one foot, to reach the heart.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 102of 125\n \n           9    And that contrasts with a femoral catheter that's down in  \n \n          10    the groin.  If that catheter is six inches long, it comes  \n \n          11    up to somewhere in the lower pelvis, but it would still  \n \n          12    have to travel a considerable distance to get to the  \n \n          13    heart. \n \n          14              The surgeon mischaracterized his catheter and  \n \n          15    where its location is.  He's very wrong.  He's off by  \n \n          16    about --I think about ten inches, and that's a great  \n \n          17    distance. \n \n          18    Q    About like that (indicating)?  \n \n          19    A    Yes.  He's saying it's under the xiphoid, I think two  \n \n          20    inches from the xiphoid process, which is the bottom of  \n \n          21    the breast bone and very close to the heart, and he's  \n \n          22    wrong. \n \n          23    Q    Now, you started your direct examination by stating  \n \n          24    that you had practiced anesthesiology for 15 years; is that  \n \n          25    correct? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             112 \n \n \n \n           1    A    That's right.  I think it's actually more like 18  \n \n           2    years now since I became attending anesthesiologist. \n \n           3    Q    But your practice does not include participation in  \n \n           4    the lethal injection process of any state? \n \n           5    A    Not for human beings.  I have done animal research  \n \n           6    where we have used IV intravenous drugs to end the animal's  \n \n           7    life after an experiment. \n \n           8    Q    So when you stated that you induced anesthesia, that  \n \n           9    would be for a clinical purpose.  Not for the purpose of  \n \n          10    lethal injection? \n \n          11    A    In human beings, that's correct. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 103of 125\n \n          12    Q    Now, you stated that you had been involved in  \n \n          13    lethal -- in testifying in other lethal injection cases; is  \n \n          14    that correct? \n \n          15    A    That's correct. \n \n          16    Q    And is there a state or a commonwealth where the  \n \n          17    government has retained your services to testify about the  \n \n          18    government's execution protocol? \n \n          19    A    I know -- just to be clear what your question is -- \n \n          20    Q    The government being the state or a prison official.  \n \n          21    A    No, no one has ever asked me to testify in that  \n \n          22    regard. \n \n          23    Q    So generally speaking then, it is fair to characterize  \n \n          24    your testimony as being at the behest of the offender; you  \n \n          25    are retained by the offender? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             113 \n \n \n \n           1    A    In most cases.  Sometimes it's been by another party,   \n \n           2    but not the state.  There was an execution in Connecticut  \n \n           3    where the offender was volunteering, wanted to proceed and  \n \n           4    other parties did not want the execution to proceed, or the  \n \n           5    other parties were concerned about the manner in which the  \n \n           6    execution was going to be conducted. \n \n           7    Q    In Connecticut, did they set up the peripheral access  \n \n           8    with two peripheral sites, or with one? \n \n           9    A    I believe the Connecticut protocol calls for two  \n \n          10    access sites, but I don't recall specifically in that  \n \n          11    execution whether they put one or two in.  In some cases  \n \n          12    there is difficulty in securing a second line and it's  \n \n          13    abandoned, so I don't know specifically.  I can't recall  \n \n          14    that autopsy report. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 104of 125\n \n          15    Q    In those states that use peripheral access, do they  \n \n          16    set up two peripheral IVs? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \n \n          18    Q    And in those states, do they use one of the access and  \n \n          19    keep the other as a back-up, or do they use them both? \n \n          20    A    It varies from state to state. \n \n          21    Q    Okay.  So some states just have one in reserve if it's  \n \n          22    needed? \n \n          23    A    That's correct. \n \n          24    Q    And other states actually actively use both accesses? \n \n          25    A    That's correct. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             114 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    But -- \n \n           2    A    At least that's their representation.  I'm not there  \n \n           3    to see what they actually do. \n \n           4    Q    I understand.  And I believe you testified that you  \n \n           5    had observed the execution chambers of other states.  \n \n           6    A    If I did, I -- only one other state. \n \n           7    Q    One other state.  Which state was that? \n \n           8    A    California. \n \n           9    Q    And did you approve of what you observed in the  \n \n          10    California execution chamber? \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Objection, Your Honor; relevance. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  I'll allow the question.  \n \n          13    A    Well, I wasn't in the posture of approving or not  \n \n          14    approving.  I don't have the authority to do that. \n \n          15    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Have you written a report about the  \n \n          16    California chamber? \n \n          17    A    I'm -- I'm not sure that I have.  I have written stuff  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 105of 125\n \n          18    about it before seeing it.  I just can't recall whether I  \n \n          19    was asked to provide a report after that inspection.  I  \n \n          20    honestly don't know. \n \n          21    Q    Let me approach the question a little bit  \n \n          22    differently.  Are you critical of what you observed in  \n \n          23    California? \n \n          24    A    There are some features of what is being done that  \n \n          25    is very problematic and some features that are not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             115 \n \n \n \n           1    problematic. \n \n           2    Q    That's fine.  Now, I believe you stated that you  \n \n           3    corresponded with the first person who set up the lethal  \n \n           4    injection process? \n \n           5    A    Yes. \n \n           6    Q    Who was that person? \n \n           7    A    A person named Dr. Chapman.  When I say set up, that's  \n \n           8    probably the -- when you say set up, that's not the term.   \n \n           9    The person who -- he's not the person who conceived the  \n \n          10    concept of lethal injection.  I think that was actually  \n \n          11    done during -- by the German government in World War II,  \n \n          12    but he's the person who -- he's not the person who  \n \n          13    conceived the introduction of lethal injection in the  \n \n          14    United States.  That was done by a legislator in Oklahoma,  \n \n          15    but he's the person who conceived the use of these three --  \n \n          16    or the use of the drugs that are used in lethal injection.   \n \n          17    He didn't really go beyond that to talk about exactly how  \n \n          18    they are given as they are given now. \n \n          19    Q    And he's the doctor from Oklahoma; is that correct? \n \n          20    A    He is a doctor from Oklahoma. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 106of 125\n \n          21    Q    Now, during direct examination I believe you stated  \n \n          22    that today you find use of capital punishment, and what I  \n \n          23    wrote down was, problematic when applied after the  \n \n          24    adversarial process.  Is that -- \n \n          25    A    That's correct. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             116 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    By that, I think I understand you to say that you  \n \n           2    disapprove of capital punishment.  Am I understanding your  \n \n           3    testimony correctly? \n \n           4    A    The problem is how you get to decide.  In my view, one  \n \n           5    of the problems is how one decides who should get it and  \n \n           6    who shouldn't, and it's not -- it's a result of our  \n \n           7    judicial system, which has got to be the best judicial  \n \n           8    system in the world, but it's still designed to reach an  \n \n           9    outcome which is necessary for maintaining order in  \n \n          10    society, and generally that outcome is the same as a  \n \n          11    righteous or truthful outcome. \n \n          12              But the system is not perfect and errors can  \n \n          13    occur in the sense that the correct outcome might not be  \n \n          14    arrived at.  And if the outcome is to do something  \n \n          15    irreversible, mainly to execute someone, then I think the  \n \n          16    protection can be arrived at in a open, truth-seeking  \n \n          17    method as opposed to an adversarial one. \n \n          18    Q    So as it's currently administered today in the United  \n \n          19    States, you would be opposed to the imposition of capital  \n \n          20    punishment? \n \n          21    A    That's correct.  I should clarify I didn't really have  \n \n          22    a position on this before I found out what drugs were being  \n \n          23    used and how it was being done.  It really wasn't on my  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 107of 125\n \n          24    radar.  It wasn't something that I thought much about. \n \n          25    Q    Now, you stated during direct examination that your  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             117 \n \n \n \n           1    review of the Missouri process showed that there were what  \n \n           2    you described as variations in the quantity of sodium  \n \n           3    pentothal given to the offender; is that correct? \n \n           4    A    It showed variations in the amount that they were  \n \n           5    intending to give. \n \n           6    Q    And those variations range between 2.5 grams and  \n \n           7    5 grams; is that correct? \n \n           8    A    No, we don't really know -- well, we know how many  \n \n           9    bottles -- sorry, kits, containers, each of which have half  \n \n          10    a gram, they took out.  So it's accurate that it sets a  \n \n          11    ceiling of how much they were given.  If ten kits, each  \n \n          12    containing half a gram, were checked out as it were, then  \n \n          13    it sets an apparent ceiling of five grams.  There's no  \n \n          14    floor set here because as the doctor describes, they give  \n \n          15    some, they waste some, and they put down the total of those  \n \n          16    two amounts and so you can't tell. \n \n          17              And even with the doctor's intention, given what  \n \n          18    we know about these individuals working in the dark, under  \n \n          19    time pressure, a person who has difficulty completing a  \n \n          20    cable bill, who has numeric dyslexia, who has to rely on  \n \n          21    the nurse because he's not good with figuring out  \n \n          22    percentages and milligrams and things like that, you really  \n \n          23    don't know how much was delivered to those prisoners. \n \n          24    Q    Okay.  Now, the other states that you have studied,  \n \n          25    what is their intent on the quantity of sodium pentothal to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             118 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 108of 125\n \n \n \n           1    be administered to the offender? \n \n           2    A    That also ranges -- the highest I have seen is five  \n \n           3    grams. \n \n           4    Q    And what's the lowest? \n \n           5    A    The lowest I have seen is around one or one and a  \n \n           6    quarter grams. \n \n           7    Q    One or one and a quarter.  Okay.  So one, one and a  \n \n           8    quarter up to five is the intent of those other states that  \n \n           9    you have studied? \n \n          10    A    To my knowledge, yes, although I'm also aware of  \n \n          11    consideration of protocol revisions that would change those  \n \n          12    amounts. \n \n          13    Q    Downward or upward? \n \n          14    A    Upward. \n \n          15    Q    Upward.  Okay.  Is any state contemplating a change to  \n \n          16    an amount higher than five? \n \n          17    A    I believe California is. \n \n          18    Q    To an amount higher than five? \n \n          19    A    I believe so, yes. \n \n          20    Q    Okay. \n \n          21    A    I think the latest iteration of their protocol  \n \n          22    included a bolus amount and also an infusion of a  \n \n          23    continuous drip, and that would result in a higher amount  \n \n          24    than five, but I'd have to refresh myself to be certain  \n \n          25    about that.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             119 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And on the second drug, the Pavalon, you stated there  \n \n           2    were also variations in the amounts that were given? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 109of 125\n \n           3    A    There's apparent variations.  Again, we don't know  \n \n           4    exactly how much was delivered.  All we know is there was  \n \n           5    an intended amount. \n \n           6    Q    Okay.  And is it true to say that for every state we  \n \n           7    don't know what amount is actually given, only the intended  \n \n           8    amount? \n \n           9    A    Well, many states perform toxicology testing, so after  \n \n          10    the prisoner is dead blood is drawn and used to measure the  \n \n          11    concentrations of the thiopental and/or the pancuronium  \n \n          12    and/or the potassium and that, in some settings, can be  \n \n          13    used to provide information about the amount of thiopental  \n \n          14    in the prisoner. \n \n          15    Q    You might draw an inference; isn't that correct? \n \n          16    A    Correct.  You are sampling from one part of the body.   \n \n          17    The only way to know the total amount delivered would be to  \n \n          18    take the entire body and extract all the thiopental from  \n \n          19    the entire body. \n \n          20    Q    And those measurements from the blood, it depends on  \n \n          21    where that blood is drawn; isn't that correct? \n \n          22    A    That's correct.  Among other things. \n \n          23    Q    Now, I believe you stated during direct examination  \n \n          24    that no other state has a physician participate in the  \n \n          25    lethal injection process.  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             120 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I didn't mean to -- if I said that, it's not what I  \n \n           2    meant.  No other state has participation to this level and  \n \n           3    this level of authority vested in one sole physician. \n \n           4    Q    Okay.  Do other states have medical personnel assist  \n \n           5    before the lethal injection occurs? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 110of 125\n \n           6    A    Yes. \n \n           7    Q    During direct examination you were shown Plaintiff's  \n \n           8    Exhibit 25, the drug log.  What is the purpose of that log? \n \n           9    A    If you could clarify the question, because purpose  \n \n          10    implies an intent in some person's head, and I need to know  \n \n          11    who -- the purpose for what person. \n \n          12    Q    Do you know why that record is kept? \n \n          13    A    I believe it's kept because the person who completes  \n \n          14    it has been instructed to fill out this information. \n \n          15    Q    What is the purpose of recording that information,  \n \n          16    according to your understanding? \n \n          17    A    It's to keep track of the flow of drugs, or the -- I  \n \n          18    guess the transfer of the chain of custody of drugs from  \n \n          19    one place and one person to another to know how much you  \n \n          20    started out with, how much was given, how much was  \n \n          21    injected, how much was discarded or flushed, and to keep  \n \n          22    track of -- it's a tracking system I suppose one could call  \n \n          23    it. \n \n          24    Q    Okay.  Now, in your clinical practice you state that  \n \n          25    you record the amount of drug, anesthetic, that you  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             121 \n \n \n \n           1    administer to an individual; is that correct? \n \n           2    A    The amount that we intend to administer, yes; we  \n \n           3    believe we administered. \n \n           4    Q    But in Missouri, in this case we're dealing with an  \n \n           5    execution, not a surgical process. \n \n           6    A    We're dealing with the induction of general anesthesia  \n \n           7    and after the induction of general anesthesia hopefully is  \n \n           8    achieved, one then goes on to kill the prisoner with the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 111of 125\n \n           9    injection of potassium.  So there's a medical process  \n \n          10    there, a necessary medical process, the induction of  \n \n          11    general anesthesia.  And that is followed by a step that  \n \n          12    causes the prisoner's death, the injection of a lethal dose  \n \n          13    of potassium. \n \n          14    Q    And the purpose of recording the number, the amount of  \n \n          15    the drug given in your practice, your clinical practice,  \n \n          16    what purpose is that?  Why do you write that number down? \n \n          17    A    It serves several purposes.  It allow us to know what  \n \n          18    we have given, to know how a prisoner is responding when we  \n \n          19    assess anesthetic depth.  Since our memories aren't  \n \n          20    perfect, we need to have a written record of what we have  \n \n          21    done. \n \n          22              It's also used for tracking, again, the use of  \n \n          23    drugs to make sure that the amount of a controlled  \n \n          24    substance, say a narcotic, that's taken out by a doctor,  \n \n          25    that none of it is diverted for purposes of abuse, that  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             122 \n \n \n \n           1    it's either all given to the patient or it's flushed. \n \n           2    Q    And you stated during direct examination that you  \n \n           3    would not want to give an entire dose of an anesthetic or  \n \n           4    an anesthesia after already giving a dose; is that correct? \n \n           5    A    That's not what I was trying to say, no.  I'm not sure  \n \n           6    of the context, so you need to clarify your question,  \n \n           7    please. \n \n           8    Q    The doctor stated during his deposition that he would  \n \n           9    give the entire dose of the anesthetic again in order to  \n \n          10    achieve the effect that was needed, and you criticized the  \n \n          11    doctor for trying to do that.  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 112of 125\n \n          12    A    What he said, I believe, was that you have to give the  \n \n          13    entire full dose.  You can't just give, the second time  \n \n          14    around, a partial amount of the amount you initially gave.   \n \n          15    So, for example, if you were trying to give ten grams the  \n \n          16    first time and you didn't get the desired effect, he said  \n \n          17    you'd have to give ten grams again.  And that's not true  \n \n          18    and that's why I disagreed with it. \n \n          19    Q    And you disagree with it based upon your clinical  \n \n          20    practice, not with the goal of achieving an execution? \n \n          21    A    I base it on the context that in order for the  \n \n          22    execution to be humane, there is a phase of the execution  \n \n          23    which is the induction of general anesthesia.  The  \n \n          24    procedure is very painful, it's a death-causing procedure.   \n \n          25    The injection of potassium is very painful and requires a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             123 \n \n \n \n           1    surgical plane of anesthesia.  You have to induce general  \n \n           2    anesthesia successfully before you do that final painful  \n \n           3    step.  So I'm talking about a context of inducing general  \n \n           4    anesthesia. \n \n           5    Q    Now, you stated that sodium pentothal depressed the  \n \n           6    cardiovascular system? \n \n           7    A    That's correct. \n \n           8    Q    How efficient is -- how quickly does that depression  \n \n           9    occur? \n \n          10    A    That depends on numerous factors.  It can be rapid or  \n \n          11    it can be slower.  Depends on how much is given, how  \n \n          12    quickly it's given, what the cardiovascular status is of  \n \n          13    the patient or the prisoner when it's given, what their  \n \n          14    cardiac output is, what their blood pressure is and the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 113of 125\n \n          15    status of their cardiovascular system.  Those are some of  \n \n          16    the factors that would affect that answer. \n \n          17    Q    So if it's robust, it fails more quickly, or if it's  \n \n          18    sick, it's a bad heart, does it fail more quickly? \n \n          19    A    We're not talking about failing.  We're talking about  \n \n          20    depression.  We're talking about reducing the function of  \n \n          21    it, and that effect will start very quickly after the drug  \n \n          22    is administered.  Basically as soon as it is pumped through  \n \n          23    the heart it starts to depress the function of the heart,  \n \n          24    and as soon as it's pumped into blood vessels it starts to  \n \n          25    depress the tone of those blood vessels and lower the blood  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             124 \n \n \n \n           1    pressure that way.  So it's basically very, very rapid once  \n \n           2    it reaches the thing that it's going to depress. \n \n           3    Q    Now, the doctor, John Doe One, stated in his  \n \n           4    deposition that the rapid onset of the effect of the  \n \n           5    drugs is desirable, but I believe you testified that you  \n \n           6    disagreed with that.  \n \n           7    A    Could you show me where he -- I don't remember  \n \n           8    discussing -- I don't recall discussing that in my direct. \n \n           9    Q    The reference given was page 95, line 4. \n \n          10    A    I'm sorry.   \n \n          11    Q    Page 95, line 4. \n \n          12    A    That was the questions of the direct examination.  \n \n          13    Q    Would you agree with me then, independently of that,  \n \n          14    that the rapid injection of the drugs is a beneficial  \n \n          15    feature of the Missouri execution process?  \n \n          16    A    No, that's not necessary to -- I believe the interests  \n \n          17    of the execution process are, number one, to achieve  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 114of 125\n \n          18    justice by causing the death of the individual, and even  \n \n          19    though it's not stated, I believe it's legally important  \n \n          20    that it be conducted in a humane fashion, and that does  \n \n          21    not require what I think you're characterizing as rapid  \n \n          22    injection, that a humane execution could be a successful  \n \n          23    injection of general anesthesia and anesthesia can be  \n \n          24    achieved by injecting drugs at a rapid rate. \n \n          25              THE COURT:  I thought your concern was as long as  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             125 \n \n \n \n           1    the anesthesia had been effectively distributed within the  \n \n           2    body, that was your primary concern.  \n \n           3              THE WITNESS:  You're exactly right. \n \n           4              THE COURT:  And after that, it doesn't matter? \n \n           5              THE WITNESS:  You're exactly right.  So long as  \n \n           6    it's delivered and maintained at a sufficient level to keep  \n \n           7    the person asleep, how fast you gave it really doesn't  \n \n           8    matter. \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Now, during direct examination you  \n \n          10    were asked about Plaintiff's Exhibit 26, the package \n \n          11    insert.  Does the package insert give information on what a  \n \n          12    dose of sodium pentothal would be for the induction of  \n \n          13    anesthesia for a surgery? \n \n          14    A    It gives some approximate doses about -- these are  \n \n          15    intended doses, doses that you would try to deliver.  And  \n \n          16    again, it's not for performing surgery.  It's for inducing  \n \n          17    anesthesia to a level where we can take control of the  \n \n          18    airway. \n \n          19    Q    Perhaps a step towards surgery, before surgery begins? \n \n          20    A    The way it's supposed to work is before you undertake  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 115of 125\n \n          21    surgery you first induce and then maintain for a period of  \n \n          22    time general anesthesia. \n \n          23    Q    And what is the recommended quantity of sodium  \n \n          24    pentothal that the package insert suggests? \n \n          25    A    Can you refer me to the -- \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             126 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Page four.  It's your exhibit. \n \n           2    A    It starts off on page three talking about dosing and  \n \n           3    administration.  There's a long paragraph there and then it  \n \n           4    goes into other things that doesn't relate to surgery like  \n \n           5    treating convulsive states and procedures and psychiatric  \n \n           6    disorders and so if you could just refer me to what -- \n \n           7    Q    Why don't you take a look at page four, what appears  \n \n           8    to be the second -- I'm sorry, the first full paragraph,  \n \n           9    the last sentence.  \n \n          10    A    Okay.  I see where you're talking about now.  It talks  \n \n          11    about three to four milligrams per kilogram.  And just to  \n \n          12    clarify that, for a typical adult male who would weigh  \n \n          13    around 70 kilograms, that would be an amount of about 200  \n \n          14    plus milligrams, 210 milligrams, 280 milligrams. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  And that sentence reads, \"As an initial dose  \n \n          16    210 to 280 milligrams of pentothal is usually required for  \n \n          17    rapid induction in the average adult.\" \n \n          18    A    That's correct, yes. \n \n          19    Q    And for those of us who are numerically challenged,  \n \n          20    that would be point -- .2, almost .3 grams? \n \n          21    A    Correct.   \n \n          22              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, I'd like to object here  \n \n          23    not to the substance of the cross, but the fact that his  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 116of 125\n \n          24    cross is counting against plaintiff's time. \n \n          25              THE COURT:  I'll be the judge of that.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             127 \n \n \n \n           1              How much more time do you intend to take,  \n \n           2    Mr. Hawke?  \n \n           3              MR. HAWKE:  I'm going to say twenty minutes. \n \n           4              THE COURT:  I'll give you ten.  \n \n           5    A    I should clarify also, that that text there is  \n \n           6    accompanied by a detailed description of how one assesses  \n \n           7    anesthetic depth because these are just estimated initial  \n \n           8    amounts.  Like we discussed, these are intended amounts. \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  For the purpose of surgery, not for  \n \n          10    the purpose of execution? \n \n          11    A    For the purpose of induction of anesthesia, whether it  \n \n          12    relates to surgery or an execution. \n \n          13    Q    And there's no instruction in there on monitoring  \n \n          14    anesthetic depth for an intended dose of five grams, is  \n \n          15    there? \n \n          16    A    I believe the instructions for monitoring anesthetic  \n \n          17    depth are just generic instructions of how one can do that.   \n \n          18    I don't believe it's curtailed or restrained to any  \n \n          19    specific dose range. \n \n          20    Q    You said that the doctor found the sodium pentothal  \n \n          21    to be hard to dissolve from which you concluded that the  \n \n          22    sodium penothal was defective; is that correct? \n \n          23    A    I didn't draw that as a firm conclusion, but it  \n \n          24    certainly raises that concern.  That's one possible  \n \n          25    explanation. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             128 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 117of 125\n \n \n \n           1    Q    The manufacturer is Abbott Laboratories? \n \n           2    A    It used to be Abbott Laboratories, but it no longer  \n \n           3    is. \n \n           4    Q    Okay.  Has the manufacturer of sodium pentothal  \n \n           5    recalled any ampules of sodium pentothal in the past three,  \n \n           6    four years? \n \n           7    A    I wouldn't know the answer to that question.  I \n \n           8    haven't asked.  I wouldn't be privy to it, I believe, even  \n \n           9    if I did ask. \n \n          10    Q    You wouldn't be privy to a recall of a drug you use  \n \n          11    every day? \n \n          12    A    First of all, I don't use thiopental every day, and  \n \n          13    very few anesthesiologists do. \n \n          14    Q    So you're unaware of any recall? \n \n          15    A    I'm not aware of a recall of thiopental in recent  \n \n          16    history. \n \n          17    Q    Now, I believe you said that the doctor found  \n \n          18    sodium -- \n \n          19    A    If I could clarify.  Also recall is something that's  \n \n          20    done when a whole batch of -- let's say the products of one  \n \n          21    week's worth of manufacturing is all pulled back, not  \n \n          22    knowing whether the individual lots are damaged or not.  \n \n          23    But it is -- it definitely does happen with drugs.  They  \n \n          24    come to a specific hospital that there's problems with -- \n \n          25              THE COURT:  Doctor, if you don't know, there's no  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             129 \n \n \n \n           1    need to clarify. \n \n           2              THE WITNESS:  Okay. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 118of 125\n \n           3    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Did John Doe One state in his written  \n \n           4    interrogatory that he was unable to dissolve the sodium  \n \n           5    thiopental? \n \n           6    A    I think the word used was difficulty, there was  \n \n           7    difficulty dissolving it and unable to dissolve the full  \n \n           8    dose into the proper volume.  He was only able to partly  \n \n           9    dissolve it. \n \n          10    Q    I believe you testified already that access to the  \n \n          11    venous system through the femoral vein is an effective  \n \n          12    means of obtaining access to the circulation system; is  \n \n          13    that correct? \n \n          14    A    When it's performed properly and the catheter is in  \n \n          15    the right place, that's correct. \n \n          16    Q    And you made reference to use of a needle during this  \n \n          17    process.  \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    Okay.  Now, how broad, how wide is that needle? \n \n          20    A    Do you mean specifically in the Missouri executions? \n \n          21    Q    Yes. \n \n          22    A    I'd have to look at the photograph of the kit. \n \n          23    Q    I believe it says .18 gauge.  So how wide is that? \n \n          24    A    I don't know in terms of the number of -- it's a  \n \n          25    little bit narrower than a coat hanger, a little bit  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             130 \n \n \n \n           1    narrower than a coat hanger wire or a guitar string,  \n \n           2    approximately. \n \n           3    Q    But you're not able to tell the court how many  \n \n           4    millimeters? \n \n           5    A    I don't know how many millimeters an .18 gauge is.  I  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 119of 125\n \n           6    believe it is -- it also refers to the -- it may refer to  \n \n           7    the inner diameter of the needle, not the outer diameter of  \n \n           8    it. \n \n           9    Q    Now, you state that piercing an artery happens  \n \n          10    frequently; is that correct? \n \n          11    A    Yes. \n \n          12    Q    Dose that happen one out of two, one out of three, one  \n \n          13    out of ten, one out of a thousand?  What's the probability  \n \n          14    of that? \n \n          15    A    It really depends on the hands of the practitioner,  \n \n          16    the experience they bring to the table, and on the  \n \n          17    characteristics of the individual.  But it's happened to me  \n \n          18    many times.  I don't want to put a number on it, but I'm  \n \n          19    not at all surprised when I'm probing for the femoral vein  \n \n          20    that I see blood that's from the femoral artery. \n \n          21    Q    And when that happens, there's no remedy for that; is  \n \n          22    that correct? \n \n          23    A    That's not correct. \n \n          24    Q    Oh, there is a solution to that problem.  What is it? \n \n          25    A    If there's a puncture of the artery and blood is  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             131 \n \n \n \n           1    leaking or being pumped out of the artery and collecting in  \n \n           2    a hematoma, then there are a series of things that one  \n \n           3    might need to do depending on how severe the injury is to  \n \n           4    the artery. \n \n           5    Q    Okay.  So it is something that can be remedied? \n \n           6    A    Generally, yes.  It may require a surgical procedure.   \n \n           7    It may require opening up the groin to close the injury  \n \n           8    directly. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 120of 125\n \n           9    Q    Now, on Plaintiff's Exhibit 18, where is that raised  \n \n          10    ridge that you discussed? \n \n          11    A    Maybe you should bring the picture back up.  It's hard  \n \n          12    to -- \n \n          13    Q    It's plaintiff's exhibit.  I assume you have it.   \n \n          14              Where is that raised ridge on that  \n \n          15    two-dimensional picture? \n \n          16    A    I'm sorry.  Do you have the picture in front of you.   \n \n          17    I can't see what you can see. \n \n          18              Okay.  Right at the tip of the catheter is the  \n \n          19    middle of that ridge.  The ridge extends at about -- it  \n \n          20    would be in the direction of 2 o'clock if it were a clock  \n \n          21    face.   \n \n          22    Q    And that's raised? \n \n          23    A    Yeah.  You can see by the way the light is reflecting  \n \n          24    off of it that it's -- even though I agree you're looking  \n \n          25    at a two-dimensional picture, one's eye can render a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             132 \n \n \n \n           1    three-dimensional interpretation of that.  We can see that  \n \n           2    his thigh there is not flat.  We can see that the catheter  \n \n           3    is closer to us, as it were, than his thigh is.

I don't know how big the  \n \n           9    hematoma is.  It could be larger or smaller than a goose  \n \n          10    egg. \n \n          11    Q    Is it smaller than a hen's egg? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 121of 125\n \n          12    A    I'm not a farmer. \n \n          13    Q    Okay.  Now, where is the blue you kept talking about? \n \n          14    A    At the tip of where the white catheter goes in, there  \n \n          15    is a bluish discoloration, and -- \n \n          16    Q    Where is that? \n \n          17    A    You see the white -- the white part of the triple  \n \n          18    lumen catheter, it's got a black piece of plastic on top of  \n \n          19    it.  If you go about the same distance as the length of  \n \n          20    that black piece of plastic, beyond the end of that black  \n \n          21    piece of plastic, there is a clear bluish-purple discolored  \n \n          22    area there. \n \n          23    Q    Okay.  Now -- \n \n          24              THE COURT:  By my count, you should know you have  \n \n          25    about three minutes left. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             133 \n \n \n \n           1              MR. HAWKE:  I appreciate that. \n \n           2    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Does everybody who receives access  \n \n           3    through the femoral vein receive -- in a clinical setting,  \n \n           4    does everybody receive a sedative? \n \n           5    A    In some cases it's not possible to achieve peripheral  \n \n           6    access because somebody has bad veins and so you have to go  \n \n           7    directly to putting in a central line, perhaps a femoral  \n \n           8    line, without having given them sedation, but it's a very  \n \n           9    undesirable situation both for the patient and the  \n \n          10    practitioner.  It's far better to give both a sedative and  \n \n          11    an analgesic, a painkiller, and that's done through an IV  \n \n          12    line so one can titrate the correct amount to that  \n \n          13    individual patient. \n \n          14    Q    And people who receive dialysis, is that done through  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 122of 125\n \n          15    the femoral vein? \n \n          16    A    Usually it's done through a shunt that's usually  \n \n          17    placed in the arm. \n \n          18    Q    Before these people receive a shunt, is there access  \n \n          19    for purpose of dialysis through the femoral vein? \n \n          20    A    That's one place that can be used.  Through the neck  \n \n          21    or femoral vein. \n \n          22    Q    And do these people receive sedation before that  \n \n          23    happens? \n \n          24    A    In my practice, yes. \n \n          25    Q    Is that universal? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             134 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I don't know the full universe of practitioners, but  \n \n           2    putting in a central line is a nasty and painful procedure  \n \n           3    and it's appropriate to do one's best to provide sedation  \n \n           4    and analgesia.  Any of us in this room, if we had to have  \n \n           5    this procedure done to us, would want to have sedation and  \n \n           6    analgesia provided. \n \n           7              MR. HAWKE:  If I could have a minute with  \n \n           8    cocounsel, Your Honor.  \n \n           9              That concludes.  Thank you.   \n \n          10    REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. ANDERS:  \n \n          11    Q    I just have a couple of questions for you, Dr. Heath.   \n \n          12              Is it your understanding that when Joe Doe One  \n \n          13    had difficulty mixing the thiopental, he testified he did  \n \n          14    not have time to call the manager -- the manufacturer, I'm  \n \n          15    sorry, and ask them about that? \n \n          16    A    Yes.  I think he referred to it being late at night  \n \n          17    and they don't have time, yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 123of 125\n \n          18    Q    Is that something that raises concerns in your mind  \n \n          19    with respect to his judgment? \n \n          20    A    Yes.  It's not an exigent circumstance where one has  \n \n          21    to do things at a certain time.  One can call the  \n \n          22    manufacturer.  They have 24-hour hot-lines and can connect  \n \n          23    one to somebody who can provide the necessary information,  \n \n          24    and I have done that on a number of occasions. \n \n          25    Q    And have you seen, or is there any evidence or data  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             135 \n \n \n \n           1    from Missouri executions from which it is possible to  \n \n           2    conclude or draw inferences that a particular inmate was  \n \n           3    sufficiently anesthetized? \n \n           4    A    We have no information whatsoever as it currently  \n \n           5    stands to know whether or not these individuals were or  \n \n           6    were not properly anesthetized.  We don't have toxicology.   \n \n           7    They have been paralyzed so we can't tell.  We just do not  \n \n           8    know whether or not they received sufficient or any  \n \n           9    anesthesia. \n \n          10    Q    And is execution by lethal injection as currently  \n \n          11    performed in Missouri a medicalized procedure? \n \n          12    A    I'm not sure what you mean by the word medicalized,  \n \n          13    but as it is currently structured if one wanted to be  \n \n          14    humane, one has to first induce general anesthesia, and  \n \n          15    that's a medical procedure.  And as it's being done now,  \n \n          16    one is placing a femoral catheter or perhaps a subclavian  \n \n          17    catheter, and those are medical procedures. \n \n          18              The execution itself I think really distills  \n \n          19    down to the administration of the drug that causes death,  \n \n          20    the potassium.  The other facets are things that are done  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 124of 125\n \n          21    to set one up to do the execution. \n \n          22    Q    And so it's your view that the induction of general  \n \n          23    anesthesia, whether in an execution setting or any other  \n \n          24    setting, is a medical procedure? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  Therefore, in that context this is a medicalized  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             136 \n \n \n \n           1    procedure.  It's being done in a way that requires a  \n \n           2    medical procedure to precede it. \n \n           3              MS. ANDERS:  Nothing further.   \n \n           4              MR.

Stephen, S-t-e-p-h-e-n.  Paul,  \n \n          17    P-a-u-l.  Johnson, J-o-h-n-s-o-n. \n \n          18    Q    And what position do you currently hold? \n \n          19    A    I'm chief of interventional radiology at the  \n \n          20    University of Colorado. \n \n          21    Q    And degrees do you hold? \n \n          22    A    I hold a bachelor of science and an M.D. \n \n          23    Q    And what board qualifications do you hold? \n \n          24    A    I'm a board-certified radiologist and I have a  \n \n          25    certificate of ABA qualification in interventional  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             138 \n \n \n \n           1    radiology.  \n \n           2    Q    Could you please describe what interventional  \n \n           3    radiology is? \n \n           4    A    Interventional radiology is a subspecialty in which we  \n \n           5    use imaging, ultrasound, CT to perform surgical procedures. \n \n           6    Q    What types of surgical procedures do you perform? \n \n           7    A    Actually I personally perform over 150 different types  \n \n           8    of procedures and the common link is that we use the  \n \n           9    imaging to accomplish those procedures.   \n \n          10    Q    So then you currently practice medicine? \n \n          11    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          12    Q    Where have you practiced medicine? \n \n          13    A    Well, I trained at Northeastern Iowa College of  \n \n          14    Medicine and interned at St. Thomas Hospital in Akron,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 5of 116\n \n          15    Ohio.  Did my residency at the University of Cincinnati.   \n \n          16    Did a fellowship training, additional training in  \n \n          17    interventional radiology at the University of Colorado.  I  \n \n          18    practiced for four years on active duty in the Air Force  \n \n          19    down in San Antonio at Wilford Hall, and then I've been  \n \n          20    back at the University of Colorado and at Denver Medical  \n \n          21    Center as well as Denver Health -- the VA Hospital in  \n \n          22    Denver ever since. \n \n          23    Q    In your practice, do you place central lines? \n \n          24    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          25    Q    And how long have you been placing central lines? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             139 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, I've been placing central lines since I started  \n \n           2    my training as a radiologist in 1989. \n \n           3    Q    Do you have a sense of how many central lines you have  \n \n           4    placed in your career? \n \n           5    A    Whenever you asked me to review that, we have a  \n \n           6    database and I think since 1996 or '97 when I came back to  \n \n           7    Colorado I've placed over 1800 central lines. \n \n           8    Q    And how many of those placements were through femoral  \n \n           9    catheterization? \n \n          10    A    The majority that I place are through the jugular or  \n \n          11    the subclavian, but a couple hundred femoral catheters. \n \n          12    Q    Is that a large number for someone with your age and  \n \n          13    experience? \n \n          14    A    Yes, absolutely. \n \n          15              MR. HELLMAN:  At this time I'd like the record  \n \n          16    to reflect I'm holding Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 31, which is  \n \n          17    Dr. Johnson's curriculum vitae.  I'm showing that to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 6of 116\n \n          18    opposing counsel.  I'm just going to bring this to the  \n \n          19    witness, if that's all right. \n \n          20    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Dr. Johnson, do you know what this  \n \n          21    document is? \n \n          22    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          23    Q    And what is it? \n \n          24    A    This is my CV. \n \n          25    Q    Did you prepare it? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             140 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes. \n \n           2    Q    Is it an accurate statement of your accomplishments  \n \n           3    and degrees? \n \n           4    A    I believe so. \n \n           5              MR. HELLMAN:  I'd like to move Plaintiff's  \n \n           6    Exhibit No. 31 into evidence. \n \n           7              MR. HAWKE:  No objection. \n \n           8              THE COURT:  Be received. \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Have you given testimony in a legal  \n \n          10    proceeding before? \n \n          11    A    One other time. \n \n          12    Q    Did that case involve lethal injection? \n \n          13    A    No, it did not. \n \n          14    Q    What documents have you reviewed to prepare for  \n \n          15    today's testimony? \n \n          16    A    I primarily reviewed John Doe One or the physician's  \n \n          17    deposition, and I did a review of the literature on central  \n \n          18    line placement, and then I looked at my own database of  \n \n          19    cases as well. \n \n          20    Q    Did you review materials obtained in discovery besides  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 7of 116\n \n          21    John Doe One's deposition, including photographs of  \n \n          22    execution marks? \n \n          23    A    Yes, I did as well. \n \n          24    Q    And are you familiar with the manner in which Missouri  \n \n          25    places femoral lines for executions? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             141 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, I am. \n \n           2              MR. HELLMAN:  At this time plaintiff would like  \n \n           3    to tender Dr. Johnson as an expert witness on the subject  \n \n           4    of central line placement, and femoral line placement in  \n \n           5    particular. \n \n           6              MR. HAWKE:  No objection. \n \n           7    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  I'd like to ask you now if you  \n \n           8    reached any conclusions upon your review, and what those  \n \n           9    conclusions are.   \n \n          10              First, have you reached any conclusion with  \n \n          11    respect to whether it's necessary for Missouri to use a  \n \n          12    femoral line to conduct executions? \n \n          13    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          14    Q    And what is that conclusion? \n \n          15    A    The routine use of central lines for administering  \n \n          16    medication for lethal injection in my opinion is in a large  \n \n          17    majority of cases completely unnecessary. \n \n          18    Q    Second, have you reached any conclusion about whether  \n \n          19    Missouri's use of a femoral line creates a significant  \n \n          20    likelihood that the inmate will experience painful  \n \n          21    complications? \n \n          22    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          23    Q    And what is that conclusion? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 8of 116\n \n          24    A    The decision to place a central line from a femoral  \n \n          25    approach in my opinion increases significantly the chances  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             142 \n \n \n \n           1    of pain and complications as opposed to peripheral IV  \n \n           2    access. \n \n           3    Q    So then, third, I take it then you have reached a  \n \n           4    conclusion whether the risk of painful complications would  \n \n           5    be reduced if Missouri were to use peripheral access to  \n \n           6    administer its lethal injection drugs? \n \n           7    A    Yes, that is my opinion. \n \n           8    Q    That it would reduce it significantly, the risk of  \n \n           9    complications? \n \n          10    A    That peripheral IV access has a lot less complications  \n \n          11    and pain associated with it. \n \n          12    Q    To what degree of medical certainty do you hold these  \n \n          13    conclusions? \n \n          14    A    A high degree of certainty. \n \n          15    Q    Why did you choose to testify in this case? \n \n          16    A    Well, I'm asked to look, because of my position, at a  \n \n          17    number of legal cases.  When I looked at this, I just found  \n \n          18    it completely unnecessary, in my opinion, to go straight to  \n \n          19    placement of a central line for all executions, if a  \n \n          20    peripheral IV is obtainable.  I just find it to be an  \n \n          21    unnecessary risk and unnecessarily painful. \n \n          22    Q    And may I ask what do you think of the death penalty  \n \n          23    in general? \n \n          24    A    I'm not categorically against the death penalty.  I  \n \n          25    think that -- and actually I see a lot of trauma.  I see a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             143 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 9of 116\n \n \n \n           1    lot of violence in my profession.  I'm basically on staff  \n \n           2    at a trauma hospital, the county hospital there in Denver,  \n \n           3    and I actually worked on a number of the Columbine kids  \n \n           4    that day.  In my opinion, the death penalty should be  \n \n           5    reserved for the most heinous crimes in this society, and  \n \n           6    so I'm not categorically against it. \n \n           7              I have some concerns about socioeconomic status  \n \n           8    and race and how it's distributed, and also have some  \n \n           9    concerns that I know that there have been people on death  \n \n          10    row that have been completely exonerated by later  \n \n          11    evidence.  So I think personally it should be used in very  \n \n          12    limited circumstances, but I'm comfortable with it. \n \n          13    Q    All right, Doctor.  Thank you.   \n \n          14              Now I'd like to talk a little bit about some of  \n \n          15    the basics of femoral line insertion.   \n \n          16              MR. HELLMAN:  I'd like the record to show that I  \n \n          17    am holding what's marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 32,  \n \n          18    which is a diagram of the venous system of the human body.   \n \n          19    I'm now showing that to counsel for the state.   \n \n          20              MR. HAWKE:  Do you have a copy for the state? \n \n          21              MR. HELLMAN:  Yes, I do.  Actually if counsel  \n \n          22    doesn't mind, I'm going to put it up on the screen. \n \n          23              MR. HAWKE:  So at the back end of the trial we'll  \n \n          24    get copies of things we have seen? \n \n          25              MR. HELLMAN:  Absolutely. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             144 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Doctor, is this diagram familiar to  \n \n           2    you? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 10of 116\n \n           3    A    Yes.  This is a drawing, anatomic -- standard anatomic  \n \n           4    drawing by Dr. Netter.  \n \n           5    Q    Are drawings by Dr. Netter relied on by experts in  \n \n           6    your field? \n \n           7    A    Yes, they are. \n \n           8    Q    And do you believe this drawing is accurate? \n \n           9    A    Yes. \n \n          10              MR. HELLMAN:  I'd like to move it into evidence  \n \n          11    as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 32. \n \n          12              MR. HAWKE:  No objection.   \n \n          13              THE COURT:  Be received. \n \n          14    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Doctor, could you point to where the  \n \n          15    femoral vein is on this diagram using the electronic system  \n \n          16    we have here? \n \n          17    A    The femoral vein is located in the groin, as indicated  \n \n          18    in the drawing. \n \n          19    Q    And is that where the femoral vein is accessed if a  \n \n          20    femoral vein catheterization is used? \n \n          21    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          22    Q    Based on your review of the documents in this case,  \n \n          23    can you give us an overview of how Missouri performs  \n \n          24    femoral access? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  John Doe's deposition indicates that he does a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             145 \n \n \n \n           1    femoral access basically with a blind technique using a  \n \n           2    Seldinger needle.  In layman's terms what that means is you  \n \n           3    essentially do a surgical prep of the area.  You've got to  \n \n           4    prep your central line kit which all takes time of course.   \n \n           5    He provides local anesthesia and then he places his fingers  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 11of 116\n \n           6    over the femoral, or what he determines should be the  \n \n           7    location of the femoral artery.  Of course the femoral  \n \n           8    artery is pulsing so you're feeling pulsations on the  \n \n           9    surface of the skin. \n \n          10              The femoral artery, nerve and vein lie deep to  \n \n          11    the skin, several centimeters.  And that varies obviously  \n \n          12    depending on how obese the patient is.  If you have an  \n \n          13    obese inmate or patient, then it can be a number of  \n \n          14    centimeters below the skin. \n \n          15              Then what you do with the Seldinger needle, you  \n \n          16    feel the artery and then you aim medial to the artery, to  \n \n          17    the location where you think the vein is, and you basically  \n \n          18    put the needle down until you hit bone, pull the stylet  \n \n          19    out.  Then you hook the needle to a syringe and aspirate as  \n \n          20    you are withdrawing the needle and then you get a flash of  \n \n          21    blood.  You can get a flash of blood if you're in the  \n \n          22    artery.  You can get a flash of blood if you're in the  \n \n          23    vein.  Obviously the artery is usually going to be brighter  \n \n          24    and pulsatile and the vein is usually going to be darker  \n \n          25    and non-pulsatile.  If you don't hit the vein, then  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             146 \n \n \n \n           1    basically you redirect the needle, repeat the steps until  \n \n           2    you get access into the vein.  Then -- \n \n           3    Q    I'm sorry -- \n \n           4    A    I'll just finish it up.  Then once you get blood  \n \n           5    return through the needle, which is usually an .18 or  \n \n           6    .19 gauge needle, you advance the guidewire through the  \n \n           7    center or the lumen of the needle.  That wire goes up into  \n \n           8    the vein and then you pull the needle out and then you  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 12of 116\n \n           9    advance the catheter over that wire and pull the wire out  \n \n          10    for your access. \n \n          11    Q    Is this procedure typically used to administer drugs  \n \n          12    in medical practice? \n \n          13    A    No, it's not typical. \n \n          14    Q    Is the femoral vein typically used to administer  \n \n          15    anesthetics? \n \n          16    A    No, it's not. \n \n          17    Q    And why is that? \n \n          18    A    Well, there are a lot of other more readily  \n \n          19    accessible, less risky alternatives.  I predominantly  \n \n          20    prefer a peripheral IV.  That's the way we standardly  \n \n          21    administer medications in anesthesia.  And actually the  \n \n          22    femoral vein for administering medications is usually  \n \n          23    reserved for emergency situations, patients who, you know,  \n \n          24    are having cardiopulmonary arrest.  And you're basically  \n \n          25    aiming at a large, deep structure, but, you know, it's not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             147 \n \n \n \n           1    typically used for standard IV access. \n \n           2    Q    What risks are associated with femoral vein access? \n \n           3    A    Well, there are a number of additional risks as  \n \n           4    opposed to peripheral IV access.  One, you can hit the  \n \n           5    artery.  The artery and the vein lie immediately adjacent  \n \n           6    to each other.  You're basically using the pulsation you're  \n \n           7    feeling on the skin to get the general location, but the  \n \n           8    reality of it is you not infrequently hit the femoral  \n \n           9    artery if you're blindly trying to get access to the  \n \n          10    femoral vein.  If you look at the literature, that's up to  \n \n          11    17 percent of the cases. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 13of 116\n \n          12              With the Seldinger needle or the Seldinger  \n \n          13    technique that he's using, you're actually doing  \n \n          14    through-and-through puncture of the vessels.  You're  \n \n          15    putting two holes into the vessel.  If you hit the artery,  \n \n          16    you've created two holes.  So bleeding occurs every time  \n \n          17    you put a puncture into the artery.   \n \n          18              It hurts.  The Seldinger technique is designed so  \n \n          19    you put the needle down until you hit the bone.  And any  \n \n          20    time you hit the bone with a needle, if you have ever had  \n \n          21    your tooth numbed up when they go in with the anesthetic  \n \n          22    needle and hit the bone, it hurts.  So that's additional  \n \n          23    pain, in my opinion, that's totally unnecessary.   \n \n          24              The femoral nerve lies immediately adjacent to  \n \n          25    the vein so they run basically in a sheath together and  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             148 \n \n \n \n           1    when you hit the femoral nerve, which also occurs a  \n \n           2    significant percentage of time, then you usually feel very  \n \n           3    bad about it, because what happens is it's like sciatica,  \n \n           4    instantaneously you get a jolt of basically pain down your  \n \n           5    leg. \n \n           6              Then there is the additional complication, one of  \n \n           7    the reasons we don't use femoral access routinely, it's  \n \n           8    right next to the scrotum.  There is chance of  \n \n           9    contamination, chance of infection.  And then any time you  \n \n          10    put a central line in the vein there is a chance of getting  \n \n          11    a blood clot and that's a longer-term complication of  \n \n          12    getting a deep vein thrombosis, but that's an additional  \n \n          13    complication. \n \n          14    Q    So, Doctor, putting all of these risks together  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 14of 116\n \n          15    collectively, could you give a range or an assessment of  \n \n          16    what the likelihood is that a complication would occur  \n \n          17    under clinical settings? \n \n          18    A    It again does depend on the patient's body habits, how  \n \n          19    fat they are basically, and the experience, but 10 to 15 or  \n \n          20    10 to 20 percent of the time, collectively, this total  \n \n          21    complication rate can occur.   \n \n          22    Q    You mentioned a puncturing of the artery.  I'd just  \n \n          23    like to get a sense of how painful that is.  Sometimes  \n \n          24    people talk about a scale of pain from one to ten where one  \n \n          25    is a trivial pain and ten is excruciating pain.  Could you  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             149 \n \n \n \n           1    give a number associated with arterial puncture? \n \n           2    A    Well, it's not the puncture of the artery that's  \n \n           3    painful, but it's the bleeding that occurs.  And depending  \n \n           4    on the amount of bleeding, it can be quite painful.  The  \n \n           5    reality of it is when you hit the artery you immediately  \n \n           6    pull the needle out and you hold pressure on the artery.  I  \n \n           7    mean, that's how you get bleeding stopped.  And you usually  \n \n           8    have got to compress on somebody's groin for 15 minutes, \n \n           9    that's standard.  Usually we're administering some sedative  \n \n          10    at that point and some analgesic, because it hurts.  On a  \n \n          11    scale, I'd say six to eight. \n \n          12    Q    Six to eight out of a scale of one to ten for pain? \n \n          13    A    Yes. \n \n          14    Q    And about how quickly will the pain result with the  \n \n          15    bleeding, is a long-term onset or is it quick? \n \n          16    A    Well, the pain is going to happen immediately.  The  \n \n          17    bleeding happens immediately.  You're pushing on the groin  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 15of 116\n \n          18    and trying to control the bleeding, so it's an immediate  \n \n          19    effect, yes.  \n \n          20    Q    Are there factors that would increase the likelihood  \n \n          21    of a puncture with a patient? \n \n          22    A    Well, I mentioned earlier how large the patient was.   \n \n          23    That's one.  The deeper the vessel, the more difficult it  \n \n          24    is to accurately locate it by just palpating.  Two, high  \n \n          25    blood pressure.  If you hit the artery and somebody has  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             150 \n \n \n \n           1    high blood pressure, then obviously you're going to get an  \n \n           2    increased rate of bleeding.  A lot of people who are either  \n \n           3    going to go into a surgical procedure or obviously if  \n \n           4    they're going to be executed, their blood pressure is going  \n \n           5    to be up. \n \n           6              If you are resisting, you know, or if the patient  \n \n           7    is uncooperative, you know, intoxicated patients, trauma,  \n \n           8    whatever, in this particular type situation if the inmate  \n \n           9    resisted at all, and I think it is very hard to immobilize  \n \n          10    somebody, particularly if you're talking about the core  \n \n          11    body muscles, that increases your likelihood you're going  \n \n          12    to hit the artery. \n \n          13    Q    Do you administer a sedative to your patients before  \n \n          14    giving femoral catheterization? \n \n          15    A    As -- I agree with Dr. Heath, yes.  Typically we do,  \n \n          16    unless we don't have a peripheral IV. \n \n          17    Q    Is the medical standard of care to administer a  \n \n          18    sedative whenever possible? \n \n          19    A    I think that -- it's accurate to say that would be the  \n \n          20    medical standard of care at this point, yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 16of 116\n \n          21    Q    Do you use any additional technology to help you find  \n \n          22    the femoral vein and avoid hitting the femoral artery in  \n \n          23    your practice? \n \n          24    A    One of the reasons interventional radiologists are  \n \n          25    putting these lines in now is because we're using the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             151 \n \n \n \n           1    imaging to increase the accuracy and the safety of these  \n \n           2    procedures.  We usually put an ultrasound device on the  \n \n           3    groin.  You can directly visualize the artery and the vein,  \n \n           4    and you can watch the needle go into the vein in the large  \n \n           5    majority of cases, which decreases the overall incidence of  \n \n           6    hitting the artery, which is a big complication. \n \n           7              Two, we use the X-ray to watch the guidewire go  \n \n           8    up into the correct vein, because there are branch vessels  \n \n           9    coming off the iliac system, so you want to be sure the  \n \n          10    guidewire is going into the correct location and you  \n \n          11    advance the catheter and confirm the catheter position. \n \n          12    Q    Does Missouri use this technology in conducting its  \n \n          13    executions? \n \n          14    A    No, it does not. \n \n          15    Q    Does Missouri give its inmates a sedative before all  \n \n          16    executions? \n \n          17    A    I don't know about all executions.  The five ones that  \n \n          18    I was available to review, they did not, no. \n \n          19    Q    Doctor, I want to cover briefly, just so we understand  \n \n          20    it, could you give in your own words exactly what a  \n \n          21    hematoma is.  \n \n          22    A    Well, a hematoma is essentially bleeding.  It's  \n \n          23    localized bleeding.  And any time that you -- even hitting  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 17of 116\n \n          24    the vein, although the vein is not under the pressure that  \n \n          25    the artery is, you get bleeding.  When the bleeding occurs  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             152 \n \n \n \n           1    in a contained space, that's called a hematoma. \n \n           2    Q    Doctor, I'd like to now read you a bit of testimony  \n \n           3    given by John Doe One in his deposition on page 77 of that  \n \n           4    deposition regarding bleeding and hematomas.  The question  \n \n           5    presented to the doctor was, \"So just hypothetically, if  \n \n           6    you were attempting to insert a femoral catheter on anyone  \n \n           7    and they moved and you ended up lacerating the femoral  \n \n           8    artery, what would you do about that?  Answer.  It would  \n \n           9    never happen.\"   \n \n          10              What do you think of John Doe One's response?  \n \n          11    A    Well, I think he's incorrect.  Number one, I think the  \n \n          12    literature, it's not just my experience, but the literature  \n \n          13    supports the fact that you do have complications hitting  \n \n          14    the artery and getting bleeding occurs.  And so  \n \n          15    categorically to say it doesn't I think is incorrect. \n \n          16    Q    Have you reviewed the photographs of the execution  \n \n          17    logs that you were provided with in this case? \n \n          18    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          19    Q    Have you reviewed the photographs of the Timothy  \n \n          20    Johnston execution? \n \n          21    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          22    Q    I'd like to now go back to what was part of  \n \n          23    Plaintiff's Exhibit 18, which is one of two photos from  \n \n          24    that execution.  I'm going to put it up on the screen so  \n \n          25    everyone can see it.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             153 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 18of 116\n \n \n \n           1              Doctor, can you describe what you see here? \n \n           2    A    Yeah.  The first thing that is obvious is the amount  \n \n           3    of blood in the field, and the blood that's in the field is  \n \n           4    bright red, which indicates to me that it's oxygenated.   \n \n           5    Obviously everybody has seen or had a peripheral IV put in.   \n \n           6    You don't get this kind of blood-letting during the  \n \n           7    insertion of a peripheral IV.  And the fact that it's  \n \n           8    oxygenated, and the degree of it, would indicate to me that  \n \n           9    the artery was hit in this particular case.   \n \n          10              If you look at the catheter, look at the blood  \n \n          11    within the catheter, it's a significantly darker color,   \n \n          12    non-oxygenated blood, so that would indicate to me that  \n \n          13    that's venous blood. \n \n          14              And then around the site, as Dr. Heath pointed  \n \n          15    out, and I agree with him, there's swelling, significant  \n \n          16    swelling right in this location (indicating.)  That  \n \n          17    indicates to me that there's hematoma present. \n \n          18    Q    And just so that everything is clear, I'd like to also  \n \n          19    show you the same picture that Dr. Heath was looking at as  \n \n          20    well.  It's from the same site, the same exhibit. \n \n          21    A    This is a different angle of the same patient, or same  \n \n          22    execution, pardon me.  And again, just so that there's --  \n \n          23    again, there's a lot of blood in the field.  It looks like  \n \n          24    oxygenated blood indicating that this was arterial blood.   \n \n          25    And then there's swelling around the catheter that  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             154 \n \n \n \n           1    indicates a hematoma. \n \n           2    Q    And just to give you a chance to comment, I'd like to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 19of 116\n \n           3    read what Dr. Doe said in response to the question about  \n \n           4    whether or not there was a hematoma here.  The question  \n \n           5    was, and this is on page 102 of his deposition, which I  \n \n           6    believe is a question from his own counsel:  \"What would  \n \n           7    you see or what would you expect to see if there was a  \n \n           8    hematoma?  How can you say there's not one here?  Answer:  \n \n           9    What they're seeing is the site where I injected by local  \n \n          10    anesthesia.  It causes a little blue mark.  A hematoma  \n \n          11    would be the size of a tennis ball.\"   \n \n          12              Can you please comment on Dr. Doe's explanation. \n \n          13    A    Yeah, to me that doesn't make sense because the  \n \n          14    lidocaine that you inject is clear, number one.  Number  \n \n          15    two, the amount of lidocaine that comes off these central  \n \n          16    lines kits is a small volume, anywhere from five to ten  \n \n          17    cc's.  Here you're seeing a lump basically that is  \n \n          18    distending the skin, and you don't see that with your \n \n          19    normal lidocaine administration.  And the blue coloration  \n \n          20    indicates to me that that's blood, not lidocaine.  So I  \n \n          21    would disagree with his assessment of that. \n \n          22    Q    I want to talk a little bit more now about what  \n \n          23    happens if a bleeding or a hematoma would develop.  I  \n \n          24    believe you were here when you heard the colloquy between  \n \n          25    state's counsel and Dr. Heath about whether or not a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             155 \n \n \n \n           1    hematoma and bleeding were treatable.  If a doctor  \n \n           2    punctures the artery, you have said it will bleed.  How  \n \n           3    does one stop the bleeding? \n \n           4    A    The standard technique is you hold manual compression,  \n \n           5    significant manual compression, because what you're trying  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 20of 116\n \n           6    to do is create more pressure outside that artery than is  \n \n           7    from within the artery.  That will control the bleeding.   \n \n           8    Then you have to allow the body's coagulation system to  \n \n           9    form a blood clot in the hole, and that takes time. \n \n          10              So the standard way of dealing with this, which  \n \n          11    by the way is not 100 percent successful, is essentially  \n \n          12    really to squish on the groin, hold pressure for 15, 20  \n \n          13    minutes, and then restart your procedure. \n \n          14    Q    Did you say 15 to 20 minutes?  I'm sorry, I  \n \n          15    couldn't -- \n \n          16    A    Yes, 15 to 20 minutes. \n \n          17    Q    I'm going to read you now John Doe One's explanation  \n \n          18    as to what he would proceed to do if a hematoma developed.   \n \n          19    This is on page 78 of his deposition transcript and it's a  \n \n          20    couple paragraphs long so please bear with me, and stop me  \n \n          21    if you'd like to comment.   \n \n          22              \"Question:  And just assuming for a second that a  \n \n          23    hematoma developed, what would you do about that?  Answer:  \n \n          24    Reach over on the tray, take the knife that's provided with  \n \n          25    the tray, open it and vent it and it would be controlled.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             156 \n \n \n \n           1    Actually under this setting, the hematoma would actually  \n \n           2    stop bleeding better than actually -- the medical treatment  \n \n           3    would be to drain it, but in this setting the hematoma is  \n \n           4    actually useful and it will stop the bleeding in a matter  \n \n           5    of seconds by itself.  So there's a medical reason why you  \n \n           6    drain a hematoma, but the reason in this situation was the  \n \n           7    hematoma would actually stop the bleeding.  But we have  \n \n           8    never and could not possibly see a hematoma in this setting  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 21of 116\n \n           9    because of the small needles used.  Question:  So when you  \n \n          10    say the hematoma would stop the bleeding, I really don't  \n \n          11    follow that.  Answer:  As it bleeds into the space, it  \n \n          12    increases the pressure around the vessel.  The pressure of  \n \n          13    the hematoma is going to stop the bleeding no matter where  \n \n          14    the bleeding is.\"   \n \n          15              I'll stop right there for the moment.  First,  \n \n          16    Doctor, is it proper procedure to open and vent a hematoma? \n \n          17    A    No.  No.  I mean, you would not make an incision in \n \n          18    the skin and allow the bleeding just to basically well up  \n \n          19    in front of you.  That would be a totally inappropriate way  \n \n          20    to deal with a hematoma. \n \n          21    Q    And then I'm going to continue reading.  The question  \n \n          22    that follows immediately the passage that I just read says,  \n \n          23    \"Question:  So the bleeding would stop on its own?  Answer:   \n \n          24    It would stop on its own.\" \n \n          25              Now, would the bleeding stop on its own if a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             157 \n \n \n \n           1    hematoma developed? \n \n           2    A    Highly unlikely.  That would be a very painful way of  \n \n           3    dealing with that particular problem, because essentially  \n \n           4    you'd allow blood just to accumulate in the leg, dissect up  \n \n           5    into the abdomen, and then what's he's basically indicating  \n \n           6    he's allowing enough bleeding to create pressure in the  \n \n           7    groin and that pressure which basically is what I described  \n \n           8    as the physician usually applies, would -- that would be a  \n \n           9    lot of blood in the groin.  That would be an extremely  \n \n          10    painful way of dealing with that particular issue.  And  \n \n          11    that is not how you deal with it.  You don't sit there and  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 22of 116\n \n          12    watch a hematoma expand and expand, generate enough  \n \n          13    pressure.   \n \n          14    Q    Would it eventually -- \n \n          15    A    I mean, you could bleed to death that way, yeah, but  \n \n          16    that would be a very painful way to go. \n \n          17    Q    If the artery were punctured, could that femoral line  \n \n          18    still be used? \n \n          19    A    Well, now it makes it harder because the artery has  \n \n          20    got a lot of muscle in it and it's hard to compress an  \n \n          21    artery.  The vein has a muscular wall, but it's a lot  \n \n          22    thinner so it's easy to compress a vein.  And it's not  \n \n          23    under pressure.  So as soon as you start having a hematoma  \n \n          24    develop in the groin, it squishes on the vein and it makes  \n \n          25    it a lot more difficult to get your femoral line in.  So  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             158 \n \n \n \n           1    it's possible, but it becomes a lot tougher. \n \n           2    Q    If the doctor were to use another site, say the other  \n \n           3    leg, would the inmate experience pain while another site  \n \n           4    was found? \n \n           5    A    If there's continued bleeding, absolutely.  I mean, if  \n \n           6    your method of dealing with it is just to let it bleed out  \n \n           7    and go to the other leg, yeah, absolutely. \n \n           8    Q    I just want to read you again for your comment a  \n \n           9    passage continuing on page 78 where I left off.  \"If that  \n \n          10    happened\" -- this is the question:  \"If that happened while  \n \n          11    you were trying to get the catheter in for an execution,  \n \n          12    how would you then get the catheter in?  Answer:  He's got  \n \n          13    two legs.  Question:  So you'd go to the other leg?   \n \n          14    Answer:  Yes.\"   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 23of 116\n \n          15              What do you take to mean by the two legs comment? \n \n          16    A    Well, basically what I -- I take it as if they botched  \n \n          17    up the first line attempt on the one leg, that they abandon  \n \n          18    it and go to the other leg.  But the statement seems a bit  \n \n          19    crass to me, a bit unprofessional.   \n \n          20    Q    I'd like to talk now about a couple of the other  \n \n          21    risks of femoral access.  You described hitting the bone.   \n \n          22    How often does that happen? \n \n          23    A    Well, if it's the Seldinger technique, that's part of  \n \n          24    the procedure because the femoral head lies just behind the  \n \n          25    artery and the vein and you can use the Seldinger technique  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             159 \n \n \n \n           1    to get into either one.  But essentially what you do is you  \n \n           2    do a through-and-through puncture of the artery or the vein  \n \n           3    and then when you hit the bone you stop and pull the stylet  \n \n           4    out and then slowly retract the needle until you get blood  \n \n           5    return. \n \n           6    Q    So this happens every time under the Seldinger  \n \n           7    technique? \n \n           8    A    Yes.  You can do a single-wall technique where you  \n \n           9    just try to puncture through the front side and that's  \n \n          10    usually what I use when I'm using image guidance.  But the  \n \n          11    Seldinger technique is designed to hit the bone.   \n \n          12    Q    And how painful, on a scale of one to ten in the way  \n \n          13    that we described, is hitting the bone would you say? \n \n          14    A    Well, it hurts.  It hurts.  I would say again in the  \n \n          15    six to eight range, and this is part of the reason you give  \n \n          16    some sedation before you do the central line. \n \n          17    Q    Would a local anesthetic be sufficient to eliminate  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 24of 116\n \n          18    that pain? \n \n          19    A    Well, again, you've got to hit the bone to put the  \n \n          20    anesthesia in so you can get deep anesthesia down on the  \n \n          21    surface of the bone, but really when you hit the bone for  \n \n          22    the first time, again I'll use that analogy of your tooth,  \n \n          23    when the needle hits the bone you feel that and it's a  \n \n          24    pretty intense pain. \n \n          25    Q    And is this a pain that becomes painful immediately? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             160 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Oh, yeah.  It's instantaneous. \n \n           2    Q    And you mentioned another risk in terms of hitting the  \n \n           3    femoral nerve.  Could you describe what happens when that  \n \n           4    complication occurs? \n \n           5    A    Well, again, when you hit the nerve it's very  \n \n           6    instantaneous.  I mean, there's no mistaking it because  \n \n           7    your patient will let you know immediately, because, one,  \n \n           8    involuntarily they -- their leg jerks and they get a  \n \n           9    shooting sensation down their leg. \n \n          10    Q    And on a scale of one to ten, just so we have a rough  \n \n          11    measure of comparison, how painful is that? \n \n          12    A    That's like having very intense sciatica.  I would  \n \n          13    bump that up to the seven to eight range.  It's a pretty  \n \n          14    painful thing. \n \n          15    Q    The complications we've talked about, are they the  \n \n          16    type of thing that can be eliminated with practice? \n \n          17    A    They cannot be completely eliminated, particularly if  \n \n          18    you're doing all this blindly.  Experience matters, there's  \n \n          19    no denying that, but complications occur.  There's just --  \n \n          20    I mean, that's a fact of medical practice. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 25of 116\n \n          21    Q    I want to read you another passage from Dr. Doe's  \n \n          22    deposition, from page 89 of that deposition.  The question  \n \n          23    was:  \"So are there any complications that could make  \n \n          24    themselves -- that could become visible after you have left  \n \n          25    the execution chamber?\"  The answer is:  \"No.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             161 \n \n \n \n           1    Complications can occur months and weeks later due to  \n \n           2    long-standing problem, but the complications that you are  \n \n           3    referring to that occur with the insertion, these only  \n \n           4    occur on a person that is doing his first five insertions.   \n \n           5    After someone has done ten of anything he'll never have  \n \n           6    another complication for the rest of his life.\"   \n \n           7              Do you agree with that statement? \n \n           8    A    I categorically disagree with that statement. \n \n           9    Q    In reading that, is it your opinion that Defendant  \n \n          10    Doe One understands the risks of the procedure that he is  \n \n          11    performing? \n \n          12    A    No, I don't think he does.  If he's making a blanket  \n \n          13    statement like that, that sounds like denial to me. \n \n          14    Q    Do you think his apprehension, or misapprehension if  \n \n          15    that's the word you would use, of those risks would affect  \n \n          16    his ability to properly perform and treat femoral  \n \n          17    catheterization and any complications that ensued? \n \n          18    A    I think that, number one, if he assumes he cannot have  \n \n          19    a complication, then he's probably not even, first of all,  \n \n          20    looking for that complication.  And his description on how  \n \n          21    he would address those complications is incorrect as well,  \n \n          22    in my opinion. \n \n          23    Q    Now, I'd like to turn to your thoughts on femoral  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 26of 116\n \n          24    access vs. peripheral access specifically.  I know we have  \n \n          25    talked a little bit about it, but now I'd like to get to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             162 \n \n \n \n           1    some specific questions.  Could Missouri's drugs that they  \n \n           2    use currently in their execution process be administered  \n \n           3    through the peripheral veins? \n \n           4    A    Yes.   \n \n           5    Q    With peripheral access, is the risk of painful  \n \n           6    complications reduced? \n \n           7    A    Very significantly. \n \n           8    Q    How would peripheral access work? \n \n           9    A    Peripheral access is basically placing the standard  \n \n          10    IV.  Your choices are in the top of your hand, in your  \n \n          11    wrist.  There are two large veins that are in your  \n \n          12    antecubital fossa.  You put a tourniquet on, put a little  \n \n          13    bit of alcohol on the skin.  You advance essentially a  \n \n          14    standard IV.  When you see a flash of blood, you advance \n \n          15    the plastic tubing into the vein.  Hook it up to the IV.   \n \n          16    One of the very first things you do is you hook that to an  \n \n          17    IV bag.  One indication that it's working is you see the  \n \n          18    dripping of the IV fluid which indicates there's no  \n \n          19    obstruction. \n \n          20              Two, it's very standard to flush the IV.  You  \n \n          21    flush it, manually observe it.  No swelling, no  \n \n          22    resistance.  Perfectly good intravenous access. \n \n          23    Q    Would you say peripheral access is less invasive? \n \n          24    A    By far.  Way less invasive. \n \n          25    Q    Could a hematoma result from peripheral access? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             163 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 27of 116\n \n \n \n           1    A    The vein is running right beneath the skin.  Most of  \n \n           2    the hematomas that we're talking about happen when you hit  \n \n           3    the artery.  So a significant hematoma from a peripheral  \n \n           4    IV, you might get a little bruise, but no is my answer. \n \n           5    Q    Is it possible to hit a nerve with peripheral access? \n \n           6    A    Very, very unlikely because these are superficial  \n \n           7    veins.  They're not deep veins, okay.  And the deep vein  \n \n           8    and artery and nerve run together.  So with peripheral  \n \n           9    access you're placing the IV in a vein that essentially is  \n \n          10    running right beneath the skin.   \n \n          11    Q    Is it possible to hit the bone with peripheral access? \n \n          12    A    Highly unlikely. \n \n          13    Q    And are IVs, in general, administered peripherally in  \n \n          14    medical practice? \n \n          15    A    Absolutely.  Routinely. \n \n          16    Q    Are you aware of any indications in this case that  \n \n          17    would make femoral access appropriate? \n \n          18    A    The only indication, in my opinion, here that they  \n \n          19    would choose to use a central access like femoral access is  \n \n          20    they could not establish peripheral IV. \n \n          21    Q    Do you have any reason to believe that that would not  \n \n          22    be possible in this case? \n \n          23    A    I'm not aware in this case that this patient is a  \n \n          24    chronic IV drug abuser which would probably be the primary  \n \n          25    indication in an inmate. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             164 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    I want to read you a few statements that John Doe One  \n \n           2    has made with respect to peripheral access as compared to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 28of 116\n \n           3    femoral access and get your thoughts. \n \n           4    A    Okay. \n \n           5    Q    Question on page 86 of the Doe deposition:  \"And if a  \n \n           6    complication occurred using femoral access for an  \n \n           7    execution, would you consider changing back to peripheral  \n \n           8    access?  Answer:  No.  Question:  Why not?   Answer:  It  \n \n           9    isn't reliable or predictable or safe.\" \n \n          10              Do you believe that's an accurate statement of  \n \n          11    the relative benefits and disadvantages of peripheral as  \n \n          12    compared to femoral access? \n \n          13    A    That's an incorrect statement.  And do you want me to  \n \n          14    elaborate?  I mean, during my review of his deposition they  \n \n          15    even admitted that they tried a femoral access in one  \n \n          16    inmate and couldn't get it in because the vein was probably  \n \n          17    thrombosed.  So, one, I think probably one of their  \n \n          18    reasons, and he may have mentioned this in his deposition,  \n \n          19    is to avoid any type publicity problems and having to go  \n \n          20    explain to the press why they struggled with the IV access.   \n \n          21    You can struggle with central venous access.  One. \n \n          22              Two, if you follow standard procedures, placing  \n \n          23    an IV, checking it, flushing it, it is very reliable, very  \n \n          24    safe, and you can rapidly administer medications through  \n \n          25    it.  As a matter of fact, every day in CAT scan, CT scan,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             165 \n \n \n \n           1    you get a peripheral IV in and you can inject three to five  \n \n           2    cc's a second for a total of 150 cc's.  That's a big bolus  \n \n           3    of contrast which can be a desiccant or basically can cause  \n \n           4    sloughing of the skin.  But that rarely, rarely happens  \n \n           5    because they do standard techniques, put the IV in, check  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 29of 116\n \n           6    to make sure it's an adequate IV.  So I just disagree with  \n \n           7    that statement.  \n \n           8    Q    In his deposition the doctor suggested that femoral  \n \n           9    access would yield quicker administration of the drugs.  Do  \n \n          10    you believe that to be correct? \n \n          11    A    Not how they're currently doing it.  It makes sense  \n \n          12    the larger caliber a tube, the faster a fluid can go  \n \n          13    through it, but they have elected to connect either, well,  \n \n          14    the central line here to eight feet of tubing.  And by  \n \n          15    doing that, they admit that what they next have to do -- to  \n \n          16    fill up eight feet of tubing, that requires 10 or 15 cc's  \n \n          17    of your injection, and then you've got to follow it with a  \n \n          18    flush.   \n \n          19              Even given all that, with the exhibit there I'd  \n \n          20    like to show the court you can very rapidly administer  \n \n          21    40 cc's through a peripheral IV. \n \n          22              MR. HELLMAN:  At this time I'd like to offer  \n \n          23    into evidence Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 33 which is a  \n \n          24    60 cc syringe and eight feet of IV tubing.  I'm now showing  \n \n          25    that to state counsel. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             166 \n \n \n \n           1              And now with the court's permission I'm going  \n \n           2    to present it to the witness who will use it as a  \n \n           3    demonstrative aid. \n \n           4              THE COURT:  No objection?  \n \n           5              MR. HAWKE:  No objection. \n \n           6              THE WITNESS:  So this is a standard peripheral  \n \n           7    IV.  That's the size of an IV that's placed in the arm,  \n \n           8    typically.  The rate of injection also depends on the size  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 30of 116\n \n           9    of the syringe.  If you used a five or ten cc syringe you \n \n          10    can create a lot more pressure than a 60 cc syringe.  They  \n \n          11    have done this to simplify their procedure. \n \n          12              And, Your Honor, I don't know if you have a  \n \n          13    secondhand on your watch, but I just want to show -- this  \n \n          14    is 40 cc's which is what the standard volume that they were  \n \n          15    injecting.  And if we take a peak at the clock, I'll just  \n \n          16    show you that basically you can inject this within 30  \n \n          17    seconds.   \n \n          18              (Witness demonstrates.) \n \n          19              So even power injecting a peripheral IV, if it's  \n \n          20    working, is completely adequate for -- for what they say  \n \n          21    they need to accomplish, which is very rapid injection.  \n \n          22              MR.

Actually, I take  \n \n           7    that back.  It's the next to the last statement I'm going  \n \n           8    to read.  The next to the last statement is this, and I  \n \n           9    believe it comes from pages 87 and 88 of the Doe  \n \n          10    deposition. \"Question:  I see.  And when you said that the  \n \n          11    femoral procedure is safe, what did you mean?

Can't hit the  \n \n          13    wrong thing.  The vein is protected by muscle on one side  \n \n          14    and the artery, which I can feel with my finger.  So if I  \n \n          15    can feel the artery with my finger and my finger is on top  \n \n          16    of the artery, I'm not going to stick my finger.  And the  \n \n          17    nerve is on the other side of all of this, so nerve and  \n \n          18    artery lacerations are impossible.\"   \n \n          19              Again, I'd just like to get your comment in light  \n \n          20    of what you reviewed in this case. \n \n          21    A    Well, I think I illustrated for the court how that can  \n \n          22    and does occur, and it certainly -- the literature shows  \n \n          23    that as well.  It's just not my opinion.  You do in fact  \n \n          24    hit the artery and nerve, and not insignificantly when  \n \n          25    you're doing it blindly as they're doing here. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             168 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And then the last statement I'd like to draw the  \n \n           2    witness's attention to is on page 83 of that deposition.   \n \n           3    \"Question:  And in making your recommendation, did you  \n \n           4    consider the risks and benefits of femoral  \n \n           5    catheterization?

I think I have  \n \n          16    illustrated, hopefully, for the court that it hurts.  It's  \n \n          17    significantly more invasive, and it involves risks that are  \n \n          18    basically avoidable by putting a peripheral IV in. \n \n          19    Q    And if I told that you Missouri was the only state in  \n \n          20    the union to use femoral access, what would your response  \n \n          21    be? \n \n          22    A    My response would be that that -- they're in agreement  \n \n          23    with me, that in the large, large majority of cases this is  \n \n          24    totally unnecessary and avoidable. \n \n          25              MR.

I'm an assistant attorney  \n \n           4    general with the state of Missouri, and I have a few  \n \n           5    questions I will need to ask you for cross-examination this  \n \n           6    afternoon. \n \n           7              The demonstration you did a couple minutes ago,  \n \n           8    that represented the injection through -- into a peripheral  \n \n           9    port; is that correct? \n \n          10    A    That was a peripheral IV. \n \n          11    Q    Peripheral IV.  And during your demonstration, you did  \n \n          12    not make a comparison of a peripheral IV vs. a femoral IV,  \n \n          13    did you? \n \n          14    A    I did not. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  And during the demonstration, you were -- I  \n \n          16    assume the liquid in the vial was water; is that correct? \n \n          17    A    That's correct. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 33of 116\n \n          18    Q    And the receptacle of the water leaving the syringe  \n \n          19    was a plastic bag; is that correct? \n \n          20    A    That's correct. \n \n          21    Q    I just want to make sure the record reflects that.   \n \n          22              Now, are you familiar with the execution  \n \n          23    practices of other states? \n \n          24    A    No, I'm not. \n \n          25    Q    So you have no knowledge --  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             170 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I have no knowledge. \n \n           2    Q    Okay.  So you don't know if Missouri is the only state  \n \n           3    that uses a femoral vein access? \n \n           4    A    No, no, sir. \n \n           5    Q    Just don't know.  Okay.  Now, during the -- during the  \n \n           6    initial discussions you stated that you had been placing  \n \n           7    central lines since 1989; is that correct? \n \n           8    A    That's correct. \n \n           9    Q    And during your practice, your radiology practice,  \n \n          10    that is primarily the insertion of central lines in the  \n \n          11    arteries; isn't that correct? \n \n          12    A    No, that's incorrect.  I place probably 80 percent of  \n \n          13    the venous catheters for the hospital.  Myself and my two  \n \n          14    colleagues. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  So you are a vein person, a person that uses a  \n \n          16    vein? \n \n          17    A    We use both, depending on the procedure.  We place  \n \n          18    central lines primarily for chemotherapy.  We place central  \n \n          19    lines when you require long-term access and they're going  \n \n          20    to come back and have multiple injections, and we place  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 34of 116\n \n          21    them for pretty much all the dialysis patients. \n \n          22    Q    Dialysis patients.  When a person receives a central  \n \n          23    line access for dialysis, does that person receive  \n \n          24    sedation? \n \n          25    A    Yes, in my practice. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             171 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And is that standard in your community? \n \n           2    A    Yes, it is. \n \n           3    Q    Now, you stated that when you use a -- or when you use  \n \n           4    the femoral access, that there is a risk of hitting the  \n \n           5    artery; is that correct? \n \n           6    A    Yes, sir. \n \n           7    Q    And from your experience, what percentage of the time  \n \n           8    does that happen? \n \n           9    A    Well, depends on the technique, okay.  If you use  \n \n          10    image guidance like I described, you still can hit the  \n \n          11    artery probably one to two percent of the time.  If you are  \n \n          12    blindly sticking the artery -- or blindly sticking the vein  \n \n          13    without any guidance, then that incidence has been shown to  \n \n          14    be up to 17 percent of the cases. \n \n          15    Q    17 percent of the cases.  And that is based on the  \n \n          16    study in France back the end of 1990? \n \n          17    A    I've seen I think several articles basically  \n \n          18    documenting the risks of femoral venous line placement,  \n \n          19    that's correct. \n \n          20    Q    And I believe that 17 percent included all risk of  \n \n          21    complications, not just hitting the artery.  \n \n          22    A    Well, we'd have -- I'd have to relook at that document  \n \n          23    to accurately state that. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 35of 116\n \n          24    Q    Do you have that with you? \n \n          25    A    I don't know.  I don't have it with me, no.  The  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             172 \n \n \n \n           1    incidence of bleeding I believe, at least in one of the  \n \n           2    documents I submitted, was ten percent, significant  \n \n           3    bleeding, hematoma formation.  Inadvertent femoral artery  \n \n           4    puncture I think was actually 17 percent. \n \n           5    Q    And that study from France involved critically ill   \n \n           6    people, did it not? \n \n           7    A    That particular one did, yes. \n \n           8    Q    And in fact, all of these studies involve people who  \n \n           9    are in need of this for some clinical purpose.  \n \n          10    A    Usually because there is no peripheral femoral access,  \n \n          11    or the patient, yes, is in an emergent type of situation  \n \n          12    which is the only real reason to put it in. \n \n          13    Q    So those people who are ill are not really comparable  \n \n          14    with a person who is condemned to death, are they? \n \n          15    A    I'd say anatomically, yes, they're very comparable.   \n \n          16    They're -- \n \n          17    Q    But the circumstances under which the procedure is  \n \n          18    administered is certainly different.  \n \n          19    A    I would say yes, I would agree with that statement. \n \n          20    Q    Now, during direct examination you were shown, or you  \n \n          21    showed us the diagram by Dr. Nets, or Netzi? \n \n          22    A    Netter. \n \n          23    Q    Neter.  And the picture that it showed of the femoral  \n \n          24    vein, at least to my eye, it appeared substantially larger  \n \n          25    than the other veins around it, did it not? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             173 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 36of 116\n \n \n \n           1    A    It is the largest vein in that particular anatomic  \n \n           2    region, yes. \n \n           3    Q    Is it -- it's bigger than a straw of spaghetti; is  \n \n           4    that correct? \n \n           5    A    Yes. \n \n           6    Q    And is it bigger than a person's little finger? \n \n           7    A    I would say in general that's probably pretty  \n \n           8    accurate. \n \n           9    Q    Okay.  Is there another anatomical landmark that you  \n \n          10    can compare it to, to say it's the exact same size as -- \n \n          11    A    It depends on the patient.  You know, a small, five  \n \n          12    foot two female, it's going to be significantly smaller  \n \n          13    than that.  A 300-pound male, it would be a little bit  \n \n          14    bigger than that. \n \n          15              One thing I didn't talk about, it depends on  \n \n          16    where you access it as far as your degree of actually  \n \n          17    hitting the artery as well.  If you access it a little bit  \n \n          18    lower -- the artery splits into two arteries and the one  \n \n          19    artery goes directly in front of the vein, and without any  \n \n          20    imaging, you know, you don't know exactly where you're  \n \n          21    entering or trying to enter that vein.  So that's another  \n \n          22    anatomic description that I didn't bring up earlier. \n \n          23    Q    And I recall you discussing during direct examination  \n \n          24    that the artery does have a pulse to it; is that correct? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  But it's continuously under pressure would be my  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             174 \n \n \n \n           1    point.  Diastole and systole.  During systole when the  \n \n           2    heart is contracting, the pressure is significantly  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 37of 116\n \n           3    elevated, say 140.  During diastole, there's still pressure  \n \n           4    in that vessel, and that's the lower pressure in your blood  \n \n           5    pressure.  60, you know. \n \n           6    Q    And the vein does not pulse? \n \n           7    A    The vein does not pulse, that is correct. \n \n           8    Q    Okay.  When you described the Selman method of  \n \n           9    doing this -- \n \n          10    A    The Seldinger technique, yes. \n \n          11    Q    -- it involved running a needle through the front of  \n \n          12    the vein through the vein; is that correct? \n \n          13    A    Well, what the Seldinger needle is, it's a needle that  \n \n          14    has a stylet and it goes through the central hole of the  \n \n          15    needle, okay.  And what basically that needle is designed  \n \n          16    to do is to puncture through-and-through the vessel.  Then  \n \n          17    you pull the stylet out so -- in the center of the needle  \n \n          18    is a hole, so when you pull back, when you enter the blood  \n \n          19    vessel, you get a return of blood.  That's one reason it's  \n \n          20    designed for that. \n \n          21              The other reason it's designed for that is so  \n \n          22    then you can put a guidewire through the center of that  \n \n          23    hole which allows you access into the blood vessel. \n \n          24    Q    Okay.  And I believe you stated during direct  \n \n          25    examination that femoral vein access was not typically used  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             175 \n \n \n \n           1    for drug administration or for anesthesia administration;   \n \n           2    is that correct? \n \n           3    A    That's correct. \n \n           4    Q    But it certainly can be used for both of those things;  \n \n           5    is that correct? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 38of 116\n \n           6    A    Yes.  And I would say would be one of my last choices. \n \n           7    Q    And it is certainly typically used for medical  \n \n           8    procedures, is it not? \n \n           9    A    It definitely can be used for therapeutic procedures,  \n \n          10    absolutely. \n \n          11    Q    Now, I believe during direct examination you testified  \n \n          12    that the -- that all the complications put together, the  \n \n          13    likelihood of complications was between 10 and 15 percent? \n \n          14    A    I think -- I gave a range.  I thought I said 10 to 20  \n \n          15    percent if you put it together, but --  \n \n          16    Q    10 to 20 percent. \n \n          17    A    But again, it is extremely variable.  But if you look  \n \n          18    at the literature, that would be your range typically. \n \n          19    Q    And hitting the artery I believe you testified was at  \n \n          20    17 percent? \n \n          21    A    I said up to 17 percent in the literature.  There's a  \n \n          22    range again. \n \n          23    Q    And hitting the bone you said happens all the time  \n \n          24    with this technique; is that correct? \n \n          25    A    It's a pretty routine part of the procedure because of  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             176 \n \n \n \n           1    the Seldinger technique as I described it. \n \n           2    Q    So that is not a complication then? \n \n           3    A    No, but it's painful. \n \n           4    Q    And hitting the femoral nerve, you used the word a  \n \n           5    significant percentage.  What did you mean by that? \n \n           6    A    It lies immediately adjacent to the vein, just like  \n \n           7    the artery, and I don't think -- I don't think there's any  \n \n           8    actual reported incidence of that in the literature.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 39of 116\n \n           9    However, when I say significant, I mean, you know, at least  \n \n          10    10 percent of the time, just like the artery. \n \n          11    Q    So it's not reported in the literature.  What is your  \n \n          12    basis for saying it's 10 percent? \n \n          13    A    Because I have hit it. \n \n          14    Q    10 percent of the time? \n \n          15    A    Particularly before we used imaging guidance.  And you  \n \n          16    know it.  It's immediate.  It's painful.  But it doesn't  \n \n          17    have long-term sequelae. \n \n          18    Q    Now, with the lethal injection process, is really the  \n \n          19    risk of infection a complication to be worried about? \n \n          20    A    Only if there's a stay of execution. \n \n          21    Q    And again, in the lethal injection context, is the  \n \n          22    risk of a, quote unquote, blood clot really something to be  \n \n          23    worried about? \n \n          24    A    Again, only if there's a stay of execution. \n \n          25    Q    So help me with my math here.  Hitting the artery  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             177 \n \n \n \n           1    happens up to 17 percent of the time.  Hitting the nerve  \n \n           2    happens 10 percent of the time.  But total complication is  \n \n           3    10 to 20 percent of the time? \n \n           4    A    That's -- that's my testimony, yeah. \n \n           5    Q    Okay.  Now, can you describe in the literature the  \n \n           6    work that was done to support your opinion, the study that  \n \n           7    has been done to support your opinion that puncturing an  \n \n           8    artery constitutes a pain rating of I believe you said  \n \n           9    6 to 8 on a scale of 10.  \n \n          10    A    That is my professional opinion from my experience as  \n \n          11    a practitioner.  He asked me to rate it. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 40of 116\n \n          12    Q    Okay.  So there's not any literature then that  \n \n          13    supports that conclusion? \n \n          14    A    Not that I brought to the courtroom, no. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  And as I recall, you said that -- are the  \n \n          16    people that you use the femoral vein access on, have they  \n \n          17    been sedated? \n \n          18    A    A large majority get sedation beforehand, absolutely. \n \n          19    Q    So a large majority, or all? \n \n          20    A    Well, only if we don't have a peripheral IV access,  \n \n          21    okay.  And that means potentially in a life-threatening  \n \n          22    situation, or when we don't have or are unable to access  \n \n          23    a peripheral IV. \n \n          24    Q    So the sedated people, you did not ask them what the  \n \n          25    pain felt like then? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             178 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It still hurts, believe me. \n \n           2    Q    But you didn't ask those sedated people? \n \n           3    A    Sure.  Every time we do a procedure, our nurse is  \n \n           4    documenting the pain scale.  Are you in pain?  What is your  \n \n           5    1 to 10 pain scale?  That's actually now a standard part of  \n \n           6    conscious sedation. \n \n           7    Q    And the nurse, when they're asking this question, do  \n \n           8    they ask the patient to distinguish between the pain that  \n \n           9    they have from the trauma that's requiring the femoral vein  \n \n          10    access as compared to what you just did to them by hitting  \n \n          11    the artery? \n \n          12    A    I don't know, how you phrase that question.   \n \n          13    Essentially when you hit the bone, when you hit the nerve,  \n \n          14    when you get bleeding, you have just caused significant  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 41of 116\n \n          15    pain in your patient.  They're hurting.  Our nurses are  \n \n          16    going, Are you in pain, yes.  What's your degree of pain,  \n \n          17    6, 8.  That's where I base my clinical opinion from. \n \n          18    Q    And these are the same people that have come in and  \n \n          19    are in sufficient trauma to require you to do a femoral  \n \n          20    vein access? \n \n          21    A    They're all patients essentially.  Now, the reason we  \n \n          22    use conscious sedation is because a local anesthesia hurts,  \n \n          23    number one.  Number two, it relaxes that person, brings the  \n \n          24    blood pressure down which decreases the degree and, you  \n \n          25    know, the likelihood of a complication, but it doesn't \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             179 \n \n \n \n           1    eliminate completely the pain when you hit the nerve, when  \n \n           2    you hit the bone.  And usually you titrate your medication  \n \n           3    through the procedure to deal with these additional  \n \n           4    problems. \n \n           5    Q    I think I understand.  Now, you say this pain is  \n \n           6    immediate.  By that do you mean within a minute, five  \n \n           7    minutes, ten minutes, an hour?  What do you mean? \n \n           8    A    Well, we talked about a number of different instances,  \n \n           9    a number of different problems.  One, when you hit the  \n \n          10    nerve, that's instantaneous pain, okay.  When you hit the  \n \n          11    bone, that's instantaneous pain.  When you start bleeding,  \n \n          12    that hurts.  And if the bleeding continues and a hematoma  \n \n          13    continues to expand, and if you sit there and watch it and  \n \n          14    let it expand, that pain is going to progressively  \n \n          15    increase. \n \n          16    Q    Okay.  And I believe you testified that there are ways  \n \n          17    of preventing the hematoma from becoming a problem. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 42of 116\n \n          18    A    Not always.  If you're blindly sticking the blood  \n \n          19    vessel -- the one situation you can't deal with is if you \n \n          20    stick the femoral vein above the inguinal ligament there,  \n \n          21    so essentially you do your Seldinger technique, if you poke  \n \n          22    a hole in the back wall of the artery that's in the  \n \n          23    abdominal cavity and you start bleeding out, it's very  \n \n          24    difficult to manually control that.  There definitely are  \n \n          25    cases when you send a patient to the operating room, just  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             180 \n \n \n \n           1    like Dr. Heath had talked about, where they have to do a  \n \n           2    cut-down and sew up the artery to stop the bleeding. \n \n           3    Q    And you are unfamiliar with that being necessary in  \n \n           4    Missouri during the past five executions? \n \n           5    A    Yes, I am unaware of that occurring. \n \n           6    Q    Now, are you aware if Missouri offers the offender a  \n \n           7    sedative before the execution -- during the period before  \n \n           8    the execution occurs? \n \n           9    A    From the documents that I looked at, it said sedative  \n \n          10    offered, yes. \n \n          11    Q    Now, this afternoon you were shown a couple of  \n \n          12    photographs in which you said that there was a lot of  \n \n          13    blood.  \n \n          14    A    Well, what I said was if you look at this field, there  \n \n          15    is a significant amount of blood in the field.  If you  \n \n          16    compare that to the amount of blood that you see with a  \n \n          17    typical IV, which I think most people in the room have some  \n \n          18    experience having an IV put in, or one of their loved ones,  \n \n          19    that's a significant -- that's a lot more blood than occurs  \n \n          20    when you have a peripheral IV established.  Absolutely. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 43of 116\n \n          21    Q    And that appears to be a teaspoon of blood, two  \n \n          22    teaspoons of blood, a cup, a quart; what number would you  \n \n          23    give it? \n \n          24    A    It's difficult to quantify that because you can see  \n \n          25    the gauze is absorbed with blood.  It's difficult to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             181 \n \n \n \n           1    quantify that. \n \n           2    Q    The gauze is certainly covered with blood.  \n \n           3    A    Well, it's soaked. \n \n           4    Q    And I believe that there is oxygen in the air; is that  \n \n           5    correct? \n \n           6    A    Hopefully. \n \n           7    Q    And that explains why the blood is red, doesn't it? \n \n           8    A    That's incorrect, in my opinion. \n \n           9    Q    You described the blood as being oxygenated? \n \n          10    A    Oxygenated blood is -- obviously the blood that's  \n \n          11    located within the artery is coming from the lungs which is  \n \n          12    oxygenated.  That's a physiological response.   \n \n          13              This is instantaneous, and this to me indicates  \n \n          14    basically when they pulled that Seldinger needle out, to  \n \n          15    get this kind of volume of blood, that coloration, they  \n \n          16    obviously hit the artery, in my opinion. \n \n          17    Q    And when blood is exposed to air it's red, is it not? \n \n          18    A    It -- different varying degrees of red.  I'll give you  \n \n          19    that, absolutely. \n \n          20    Q    And in the catheter you described the blood as being  \n \n          21    darker; is that correct? \n \n          22    A    Yes. \n \n          23    Q    And blood in the catheter has not been exposed to air,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 44of 116\n \n          24    has it? \n \n          25    A    Most likely not. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             182 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    All right.  Now, can you explain to the court the risk  \n \n           2    that you explain to your patients when you -- before you do  \n \n           3    a peripheral IV on them? \n \n           4    A    We don't consent for peripheral IVs. \n \n           5    Q    A patient does not consent? \n \n           6    A    Absolutely not.  There basically are no legitimate  \n \n           7    risks for putting in a peripheral IV.  I mean, you might  \n \n           8    not be able to get it in, but we don't have patients  \n \n           9    signing consent to have a peripheral IV.  You would be  \n \n          10    having thousands of consents signed every day.  Absolutely  \n \n          11    not.  Because the risks are so minimal that it doesn't  \n \n          12    justify a formal consent. \n \n          13    Q    A formal consent.  Well, let's phrase the question  \n \n          14    differently.  If you're talking with the patient and the  \n \n          15    patient asks you what risks are there from a peripheral IV,  \n \n          16    what will you tell the patient? \n \n          17    A    I would tell the patient primarily it may take us one  \n \n          18    or two pokes to get an IV in.  If we've got an established  \n \n          19    IV, there is essentially very, very little risk.  There is  \n \n          20    a small risk of extravasation which, because it's on the  \n \n          21    surface of the skin, we will immediately detect. \n \n          22              I mean, you know, if you're trying to, in my  \n \n          23    mind, increase the overall risks of a peripheral IV I'm  \n \n          24    just going to disagree with that, because they're just an  \n \n          25    essentially well-functioning IV that you can see sitting on  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             183 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 45of 116\n \n \n \n           1    the surface of your skin that poses very little, minuscule  \n \n           2    risk for the patient. \n \n           3    Q    And you do not inform the patient of those risks  \n \n           4    before you do a stick? \n \n           5    A    No. \n \n           6    Q    Okay.  And is that the standard of care that I can  \n \n           7    expect in Colorado? \n \n           8    A    I would think that is the standard of care,  \n \n           9    absolutely.  You talk about the surgical risk of the  \n \n          10    procedure you're doing, et cetera, et cetera.  But the risk  \n \n          11    for a peripheral IV, no. \n \n          12    Q    Okay.  So from your perspective, there's no risk of  \n \n          13    bleeding? \n \n          14    A    Not significant bleeding, no. \n \n          15    Q    I didn't say significant.  \n \n          16    A    You might get a few -- a tiny bruise.  Nothing that's  \n \n          17    going to require surgery or evacuation.  The vein is not  \n \n          18    under pressure, no.  Significant bleeding, absolutely not. \n \n          19    Q    And is there a risk of pain? \n \n          20    A    Relative, yes.  I would say the initial -- the initial \n \n          21    pin-prick, sure.  It's a much smaller catheter.   \n \n          22    Absolutely. \n \n          23    Q    And there's no risk of hitting a nerve? \n \n          24    A    I have never -- I personally have never hit a nerve  \n \n          25    putting a peripheral IV in.  So is there a chance?  Yeah, I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             184 \n \n \n \n           1    would say, but it's not a significant chance. \n \n           2    Q    Not enough that -- \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 46of 116\n \n           3    A    Way less than a percent. \n \n           4    Q    -- you would inform your patient.   \n \n           5              Now, would you agree as a general matter that the  \n \n           6    more experience one has doing a peripheral IV or doing a  \n \n           7    femoral vein access, the more proficient one becomes at it? \n \n           8    A    I would agree with that.  And I'd also like to state  \n \n           9    that his statement that there is no risk is just  \n \n          10    categorically wrong.  \n \n          11    Q    Now -- \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Mr. Hawke, I hope you're winding  \n \n          13    down now. \n \n          14              MR. HAWKE:  I am. \n \n          15    Q    (By Mr. Hawke)  Are there certain patients where you  \n \n          16    would not advise them to use a peripheral IV? \n \n          17    A    For which particular type of procedure?  I mean, in  \n \n          18    general, patients who are going to need a long-term IV  \n \n          19    access, okay, for multiple infusions of chemotherapy,  \n \n          20    you would not put a peripheral IV in that type of patient.   \n \n          21    Dialysis, in which you require flow rates of 350 to  \n \n          22    450 cc's a minute, obviously you're not going to do that  \n \n          23    through a peripheral IV. \n \n          24              MR. HAWKE:  If I could have a moment with  \n \n          25    counsel.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             185 \n \n \n \n           1              That concludes my questioning, Your Honor.   \n \n           2              MR. HELLMAN:  Just a brief redirect, Your Honor. \n \n           3    REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HELLMAN:  \n \n           4    Q    Dr. Johnson, is there any difference in the anatomy   \n \n           5    relative to femoral catheterization between an older person  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 47of 116\n \n           6    or a sick person and a prison inmate, the best you can  \n \n           7    tell? \n \n           8    A    The anatomy is pretty standard, yeah.  There's no  \n \n           9    change in the anatomy, no. \n \n          10    Q    Do you believe that a prison inmate about to undergo  \n \n          11    execution might suffer from high blood pressure? \n \n          12    A    Absolutely. \n \n          13    Q    Is that a factor that would increase the risk over the  \n \n          14    general population of femoral access? \n \n          15    A    Well, I -- hypertension definitely increases the  \n \n          16    chance of getting significant bleeding, yes. \n \n          17    Q    Would you call it a significant increase over the  \n \n          18    general population? \n \n          19    A    In a nonsedated person, I would say in a nonsedated  \n \n          20    person, because you can generalize that to the acute  \n \n          21    critical stage when you couldn't sedate somebody as well,  \n \n          22    yes, that situation increases your chance of complications. \n \n          23    Q    Are you aware if Missouri, when it offers sedation to  \n \n          24    an inmate, explains the risks of femoral access and the  \n \n          25    possible painful complications that could result? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             186 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I see no documentation of that, no, because they have  \n \n           2    stated there are no risks. \n \n           3    Q    If a severe bleeding were to occur as a result of an  \n \n           4    arterial puncture, does Missouri have equipment in the  \n \n           5    execution facility to properly care and remedy that type of  \n \n           6    injury? \n \n           7    A    Not that I'm aware of.  If they had to go to the  \n \n           8    operating room to repair the hole in the artery, no, I'm  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 48of 116\n \n           9    not aware of that.  But I personally haven't toured the  \n \n          10    facility. \n \n          11    Q    Just for the record, what type of equipment would be  \n \n          12    necessary to do that? \n \n          13    A    Well, you're talking major surgical procedure.  You  \n \n          14    need to have general anesthesia.  You need to have a  \n \n          15    sterile surgical field, as well as all of the sterile  \n \n          16    surgical steps required to do a femoral arterial cut-down  \n \n          17    and repair the artery. \n \n          18    Q    Going back to the exhibits from the Johnston  \n \n          19    execution, I just want to be sure I understood your  \n \n          20    testimony.  The color of the blood that is outside the  \n \n          21    catheter is a lighter red than the color of the blood  \n \n          22    inside.  What is your medical opinion about why the reason  \n \n          23    the blood outside the catheter is lighter? \n \n          24    A    Because it came from a femoral source.  It's  \n \n          25    oxygenated compared to the venous blood. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             187 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    To what degree of certainty do you hold that opinion? \n \n           2    A    A high degree of certainty. \n \n           3              MR. HELLMAN:  One second, Your Honor. \n \n           4              Those are all the questions I have for  \n \n           5    Dr. Johnson. \n \n           6              MR. HAWKE:  Nothing else, Your Honor. \n \n           7              THE COURT:  Thank you, Doctor. \n \n           8              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, I apologize for this,  \n \n           9    but our third expert, Dr. Thomas Henthorn's flight was  \n \n          10    delayed by about two and a half hours.  He landed in Kansas  \n \n          11    City about 20 minutes ago and should be here within a half  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 49of 116\n \n          12    hour, hopefully much sooner.  We certainly apologize to the  \n \n          13    court for the inconvenience in time, but I'm wondering if  \n \n          14    you wouldn't mind if we could take a short recess to allow  \n \n          15    Dr. Henthorn to get into the courtroom.  We certainly  \n \n          16    believe his testimony is important to this case. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  Well, if it was important he would be  \n \n          18    here sooner rather than later.  I'll take a brief recess,  \n \n          19    but I'm going to recalculate your time as well.   \n \n          20              Thank you.   \n \n          21                        (Recess)  \n \n          22              MR.

PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n          19              THE COURT:  Okay.   \n \n          20    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Did these Missouri records you  \n \n          21    reviewed include for each of the six inmates the ECG  \n \n          22    reports? \n \n          23    A    Yes, they did. \n \n          24    Q    And did you also review the interrogatory responses of  \n \n          25    John Does One through Five? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             190 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes. \n \n           2    Q    And did you also review the Crawford interrogatory  \n \n           3    answers? \n \n           4    A    Yes. \n \n           5    Q    And did you review Mr. Crawford's deposition  \n \n           6    transcript? \n \n           7    A    Yes, sir. \n \n           8    Q    And did you review the deposition transcript of John  \n \n           9    Doe One? \n \n          10    A    Yes. \n \n          11    Q    Have you ever testified before in a lethal injection  \n \n          12    case? \n \n          13    A    No. \n \n          14    Q    Would you be testifying in this case if you didn't  \n \n          15    think there were problems with Missouri's lethal injection  \n \n          16    procedure? \n \n          17    A    No. \n \n          18    Q    In your medical opinion, based on your review of the  \n \n          19    execution materials provided by Missouri, does Missouri's  \n \n          20    lethal injection procedure leave enough time for the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 52of 116\n \n          21    thiopental to take effect before injecting the potassium  \n \n          22    chloride? \n \n          23    A    No, it does not. \n \n          24    Q    So in your opinion, do you think the lethal injection  \n \n          25    procedure causes significant risk of unnecessary pain? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             191 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes. \n \n           2    Q    Now, is thiopental one of your areas of expertise? \n \n           3    A    Yes, it is. \n \n           4    Q    And as you understand it, does Missouri use thiopental  \n \n           5    in its lethal injection procedure? \n \n           6    A    Yes, it does. \n \n           7    Q    What is thiopental, briefly? \n \n           8    A    Thiopental is a barbiturate that acts on the brain to  \n \n           9    produce sedation and sleep or hypnosis. \n \n          10    Q    And is sodium pentothal just another word for  \n \n          11    thiopental? \n \n          12    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          13    Q    Where does thiopental need to get into the body to  \n \n          14    take effect? \n \n          15    A    Well, it needs to enter the brain. \n \n          16    Q    Can it take effect before it gets into the brain? \n \n          17    A    No, it cannot. \n \n          18    Q    Do you understand Missouri's lethal injection  \n \n          19    procedure to inject thiopental into the femoral vein? \n \n          20    A    Yes, that's true. \n \n          21              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, let the record reflect  \n \n          22    that I'm showing the opposing counsel Plaintiff's Exhibit  \n \n          23    35 and 36.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 53of 116\n \n          24    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Is this an accurate picture  \n \n          25    regarding the human circulatory system? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             192 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Diagrammatically it appears to be accurate. \n \n           2    Q    Is this the system through which thiopental must  \n \n           3    travel on its way to the brain? \n \n           4    A    Yes, it includes that. \n \n           5              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we offer into evidence  \n \n           6    Exhibit 35, Plaintiff's Exhibit 35. \n \n           7              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n           8              THE COURT:  It will be received.   \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Please describe the course of  \n \n          10    thiopental, starting when it is first injected.  And  \n \n          11    could you mark the path of the thiopental on the screen.   \n \n          12    It actually will show up so we can all see it.  \n \n          13    A    Yes.  It would be injected into the femoral -- there  \n \n          14    it is -- into the femoral vein.  It would then travel into  \n \n          15    the pelvis through the iliac vein, which is here.  And then  \n \n          16    into the inferior vena cava and from the vena cava it would  \n \n          17    travel up to the heart in the chest. \n \n          18    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  Let the record reflect the screen  \n \n          19    is now showing Plaintiff's Exhibit 36.  Is this an accurate  \n \n          20    depiction of the heart and lungs? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we offer into evidence  \n \n          23    Exhibit 36. \n \n          24              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n          25              THE COURT:  Be received. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             193 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 54of 116\n \n \n \n           1    A    Okay to proceed?   \n \n           2         Okay.  Thanks.  From here it would enter the right  \n \n           3    side of the heart, specifically the right atrium.  It would  \n \n           4    travel down into the left -- the right ventricle which is a  \n \n           5    powerful pump which will pump the blood out into the  \n \n           6    pulmonary artery.  Here the artery is marked as being blue  \n \n           7    because the blood is not oxygenated.  Then it goes out into  \n \n           8    the capillaries of the lung. \n \n           9              The blood re-collects in these red vessels which  \n \n          10    brings the blood back into the left side of the heart, the  \n \n          11    left atrium.  From the left atrium it goes into the left  \n \n          12    ventricle and the ventricle contracts and would then send  \n \n          13    the blood up the aorta into the arteries and very rapidly  \n \n          14    after that it would be in the tissues of the body. \n \n          15    Q    Dr. Henthorn, from the time the injection is first  \n \n          16    started, how long does it take the thiopental to travel  \n \n          17    this course and get to the brain? \n \n          18    A    If you include the injection tubing, it's about 45  \n \n          19    seconds. \n \n          20    Q    And once the thiopental is in the brain, does it take  \n \n          21    affect instantly? \n \n          22    A    No, it does not. \n \n          23    Q    Why not? \n \n          24    A    It must move across the concentration gradient  \n \n          25    Initially the concentrations in the blood are very high.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             194 \n \n \n \n           1    It then diffuses into the brain tissue and the  \n \n           2    concentrations in the brain begin to rise. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 55of 116\n \n           3    Q    Please describe briefly the concept of depth of  \n \n           4    anesthesia.  \n \n           5    A    Well, depth of anesthesia refers to interplay between  \n \n           6    unconsciousness and a stimuli that might interrupt that  \n \n           7    unconsciousness.  At the farthest end of the curve would be  \n \n           8    no stimuli whatsoever.  Somebody may appear to be  \n \n           9    unconscious, they close their eyes or fall asleep  \n \n          10    spontaneously.  Next up would be a stimulus of voice, a  \n \n          11    voice command.  Beyond that would be like touch.  And then  \n \n          12    various levels of pain would be moderate pain and high pain  \n \n          13    and extreme pain. \n \n          14    Q    So is it possible to not be able to respond to voice,  \n \n          15    but to be able to respond to touch? \n \n          16    A    Yes.  I have to think about that.  I'm slow after no  \n \n          17    sleep. \n \n          18    Q    And is it possible not to be able to respond to touch,  \n \n          19    but to be able to respond to moderate pain? \n \n          20    A    Yes. \n \n          21    Q    And is it possible to not be able to respond to  \n \n          22    moderate pain, but be able to respond to a higher level of  \n \n          23    pain? \n \n          24    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          25    Q    Have you read Dr. Dershwitz' affidavits in the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             195 \n \n \n \n           1    Johnston litigation in Missouri? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    Have you read Dr. Dershwitz' affidavits in the Brown  \n \n           4    case in North Carolina? \n \n           5    A    Yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 56of 116\n \n           6    Q    In those affidavits, what depth of anesthesia does  \n \n           7    Dr. Dershwitz select as appropriate for a lethal injection? \n \n           8    A    He uses for his modeling response to voice command, or  \n \n           9    lack of response to voice command. \n \n          10    Q    Do you think voice recognition loss of consciouness is  \n \n          11    the correct depth of anesthesia to choose?  \n \n          12    A    Not for something painful.   \n \n          13    Q    Why not? \n \n          14    A    Because there could still be a response to pain. \n \n          15    Q    What depth of anesthesia would you select as  \n \n          16    appropriate for a lethal injection execution? \n \n          17    A    I would select silence of the cerebral cortex that  \n \n          18    corresponds to an isoelectric or flat line ECG.  It's also  \n \n          19    known as burst suppression. \n \n          20    Q    Why is burst suppression the appropriate method of  \n \n          21    determining consciousness for a lethal injection execution? \n \n          22    A    Because without having cerebral activity there is no  \n \n          23    chance that there would be any conscience recognition of  \n \n          24    pain. \n \n          25    Q    So if someone has been anesthetized but has not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             196 \n \n \n \n           1    reached burst suppression, is it possible for them to feel  \n \n           2    pain? \n \n           3    A    Yes, it is. \n \n           4    Q    But if someone has reached burst suppression, is it  \n \n           5    possible for them consciously to feel pain? \n \n           6    A    In my best medical opinion, no, it's not possible for  \n \n           7    them to feel pain, or experience pain. \n \n           8    Q    Why do trained anesthesiologists monitor anesthetic  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 57of 116\n \n           9    depth during surgery? \n \n          10    A    To be sure that the anesthetic drugs are working, that  \n \n          11    they're working properly. \n \n          12    Q    Can we be sure that anesthesia is working without  \n \n          13    monitoring anesthetic depth? \n \n          14    A    In my opinion, no. \n \n          15    Q    And in the execution context, what can go wrong that  \n \n          16    can prevent anesthesia from working? \n \n          17    A    Well, with these large doses, the thing that could  \n \n          18    prevent it from working would be delivery, so it could be a  \n \n          19    leaking tube, leaking stopcocks, things like that, could be  \n \n          20    extravasation into the tissue instead of into the blood  \n \n          21    vessels.  It could be prevention of the blood to freely  \n \n          22    flow if there were straps on an arm or something like that,  \n \n          23    if it were going into a peripheral IV.  Or the dose could  \n \n          24    be incorrect, either prepared improperly or was a defective  \n \n          25    dose. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             197 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Let the record reflect that the screen is now showing  \n \n           2    a photo of the executioner and doctor's view of the  \n \n           3    gurney. \n \n           4              MR. BERGER:  My understanding is this has already  \n \n           5    been admitted into evidence as part of the video from the  \n \n           6    tour of the facility. \n \n           7              MR. PRITCHETT:  I understand that as well.  No  \n \n           8    objection to the still photograph. \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  There's a person lying on the gurney  \n \n          10    here.  The first of these photos shows a person lying on  \n \n          11    the gurney as seen from the execution support room from the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 58of 116\n \n          12    view approximately of one of the plungers.  Dr. Henthorn,  \n \n          13    in your medical opinion, could a person untrained in  \n \n          14    anesthesiology properly judge anesthetic depth given this  \n \n          15    view? \n \n          16    A    No. \n \n          17    Q    Why not? \n \n          18    A    Well, first of all, the individual is covered up so \n \n          19    many of the signs of late anesthesia, movement, et cetera,  \n \n          20    would not be discernible with someone covered up.  Second  \n \n          21    of all, you can't even really see the facial expression.   \n \n          22    And most importantly, there is an object in the way that  \n \n          23    prevents you from interacting with the patient -- or the  \n \n          24    inmate, sorry. \n \n          25    Q    What is that object? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             198 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It's the window with blinds on it. \n \n           2    Q    In your medical opinion, could a trained  \n \n           3    anesthesiologist properly judge anesthetic depth given  \n \n           4    this view? \n \n           5    A    They would be extremely hesitant to because most  \n \n           6    anesthesiologists would believe you could not do that,  \n \n           7    and I believe that as well. \n \n           8    Q    And this is also a picture from the execution support  \n \n           9    room of a person lying on the gurney with a slightly  \n \n          10    different angle.  This would be the view of one of the  \n \n          11    other plungers.  In your medical opinion, could a person  \n \n          12    untrained in anesthesiology properly judge anesthetic depth  \n \n          13    given this view? \n \n          14    A    No. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 59of 116\n \n          15    Q    Would that be for substantially the same reasons that  \n \n          16    you said before? \n \n          17    A    The same reasons. \n \n          18    Q    And in your medical opinion, could a trained  \n \n          19    anesthesiologist properly judge anesthetic depth? \n \n          20    A    No. \n \n          21    Q    Also for the same reasons? \n \n          22    A    The same reasons. \n \n          23    Q    When we talk about the word pharmacokinetics, what  \n \n          24    does that mean? \n \n          25    A    It's the study of the timed course of drugs in the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             199 \n \n \n \n           1    body.  Specifically, it would be the distribution of drugs  \n \n           2    through body tissues, and the other would be metabolism of  \n \n           3    the drug or its elimination. \n \n           4    Q    Does thiopental take effect immediately? \n \n           5    A    No, it does not. \n \n           6    Q    And the affidavits you referred to above, does  \n \n           7    Dr. Dershwitz' affidavits take into account the time it  \n \n           8    takes for thiopental to take effect?  \n \n           9    A    It was not evident to me that he used those in his  \n \n          10    calculations. \n \n          11    Q    Have you read the transcript of John Doe One's  \n \n          12    deposition? \n \n          13    A    Yes. \n \n          14    Q    Based on your reading of the transcript, how long does  \n \n          15    he say it will take for thiopental to take effect? \n \n          16    A    He says it will take effect within 15 seconds. \n \n          17    Q    In your medical opinion, is this right? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 60of 116\n \n          18    A    This is not correct.  \n \n          19    Q    Dr. Dershwitz testified in this case on January 30th,  \n \n          20    2006.  He said, quote, the typical time to lose  \n \n          21    consciousness will be somewhere between 30 seconds and one  \n \n          22    and a half minutes.   \n \n          23              Defining loss of consciousness as Dr. Dershwitz  \n \n          24    does as being unable to respond correctly to verbal  \n \n          25    commands, do you agree that loss of consciousness might  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             200 \n \n \n \n           1    arrive within a minute and a half? \n \n           2    A    Yes, it's possible. \n \n           3    Q    Would burst suppression arrive within one and a half  \n \n           4    minutes with a five-gram dose? \n \n           5    A    It's unlikely, according to my calculations. \n \n           6    Q    Would burst suppression arrive within a minute and a  \n \n           7    half with a two-and-a-half-gram dose? \n \n           8    A    Well, actually -- you said the first one was five? \n \n           9    Q    Yes. \n \n          10    A    Let me backtrack.  It would be likely at a minute and  \n \n          11    a half to have burst suppression, but not with a 2.5. \n \n          12    Q    And would burst suppression arrive -- strike that.   \n \n          13    Would burst suppression within the minute and a half with  \n \n          14    a five-gram dose still be likely if we considered the  \n \n          15    reduction in cardiac output? \n \n          16    A    No, not with reduction in cardiac output. \n \n          17    Q    Do you consider reduction in cardiac output likely? \n \n          18    A    Extremely likely. \n \n          19    Q    And would burst suppression arrive within a minute and  \n \n          20    a half with a two-gram dose? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 61of 116\n \n          21    A    It's -- it's unlikely with a two-gram dose. \n \n          22    Q    So while Dr. Dershwitz does recognize that thiopental  \n \n          23    needs time to take effect, is he correct that a minute and  \n \n          24    a half is the longest it would take for thiopental to reach  \n \n          25    the necessary level of anesthesia to assure that the inmate  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             201 \n \n \n \n           1    would not feel pain? \n \n           2    A    No.  It's too short. \n \n           3    Q    In your medical opinion, is there a significant risk  \n \n           4    that the protocol as carried out by Missouri causes  \n \n           5    unnecessary pain? \n \n           6    A    Yes.   \n \n           7              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, let the record reflect  \n \n           8    that I'm showing opposing counsel Figure 1. \n \n           9              Your Honor, would you like me to bring each of  \n \n          10    the figures up to the witness that are on the screen, the  \n \n          11    physical figures? \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Are they the same thing that's on the  \n \n          13    screen? \n \n          14              THE WITNESS:  The same.  I don't need them. \n \n          15              THE COURT:  He doesn't need them. \n \n          16    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  What is this, Dr. Henthorn? \n \n          17    A    This is a graph that first shows the course of  \n \n          18    thiopental as it works its way from the injecting syringe  \n \n          19    to the brain, which takes about 45 seconds. \n \n          20    Q    How do you know what this is? \n \n          21    A    I prepared this. \n \n          22              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we offer Plaintiff's  \n \n          23    Exhibit 39 into evidence. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 62of 116\n \n          24              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n          25              THE COURT:  It will be received. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             202 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  So please take us through the  \n \n           2    thiopental's path through the body and how long each step  \n \n           3    takes.  How long does it take for the thiopental to get to  \n \n           4    the end of the tubing from the syringe? \n \n           5    A    7.5 seconds. \n \n           6    Q    And how long does it take from there to get to the  \n \n           7    heart? \n \n           8    A    12 seconds. \n \n           9    Q    And at that point, once the thiopental is in the  \n \n          10    heart, what is the arterial concentration of thiopental? \n \n          11    A    As it shows in this graph, it is zero. \n \n          12    Q    And what is the brain concentration of thiopental at  \n \n          13    that point? \n \n          14    A    It would also be zero. \n \n          15    Q    Does the thiopental go to the lung next? \n \n          16    A    Yes. \n \n          17    Q    And about how long does it take for it to go to the  \n \n          18    lung? \n \n          19    A    About 13 seconds. \n \n          20    Q    What is the arterial concentration of thiopental then? \n \n          21    A    Still zero. \n \n          22    Q    And the brain concentration at that point? \n \n          23    A    It's still zero. \n \n          24    Q    Does the thiopental then go back to the heart? \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             203 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 63of 116\n \n \n \n           1    Q    About how long does it take to get back to the heart? \n \n           2    A    Approximately another 13 seconds. \n \n           3    Q    And then does it go to the arteries? \n \n           4    A    Yes, it does. \n \n           5    Q    And from there how long does it take to get to the  \n \n           6    brain? \n \n           7    A    Best guess would be -- not a guess, but it would be  \n \n           8    one to three seconds. \n \n           9    Q    Once the thiopental is in the brain, does it take  \n \n          10    instant effect? \n \n          11    A    No, it does not. \n \n          12    Q    What needs to happen for it to work in the brain? \n \n          13    A    What needs to happen is it needs to diffuse from the  \n \n          14    arteries in the brain -- the capillaries in the brain, into  \n \n          15    the brain tissue. \n \n          16    Q    The graphs here plot both arterial plasma  \n \n          17    concentration and brain concentration.  Which measure is a  \n \n          18    better indicator of when a patient or inmate will be at  \n \n          19    burst suppression? \n \n          20    A    It would be the brain concentration, or the effect  \n \n          21    side concentration. \n \n          22    Q    And does it take longer for the thiopental modeling  \n \n          23    to run to the arteries or in the brain? \n \n          24    A    It's more rapid in the arteries.  It's longer in the  \n \n          25    brain. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             204 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    In your opinion, does Missouri give enough time for  \n \n           2    the thiopental to take effect before the potassium chloride  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 64of 116\n \n           3    is injected? \n \n           4    A    No. \n \n           5    Q    What knowledge did you base this modeling on? \n \n           6    A    This modeling is based on modeling that was developed  \n \n           7    in our laboratory, mostly by myself, and it's based on  \n \n           8    experiments over a number of years. \n \n           9    Q    How much experience do you have performing this kind  \n \n          10    of modeling? \n \n          11    A    I exclusively did this sort of modeling for at least  \n \n          12    twelve years, and with thiopental for I believe about six  \n \n          13    manuscripts.  We also -- yeah. \n \n          14    Q    And have you tested your models in the scientific  \n \n          15    community? \n \n          16    A    Yes.  These have been subjected to peer review in very  \n \n          17    good journals.  They have been published and well-received  \n \n          18    there.  And in addition, this was the basis of my National  \n \n          19    Institute of Health research. \n \n          20    Q    And what has the response of the scientific community  \n \n          21    been to your models? \n \n          22    A    It was favorable.  We got quite a good score and we  \n \n          23    were funded for -- I was funded for eleven straight years  \n \n          24    to do this kind of work. \n \n          25    Q    How many people in the country would you say have as  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             205 \n \n \n \n           1    much experience as you do modeling the pharmacokinetics of  \n \n           2    thiopental? \n \n           3    A    If we're talking about the specifics of onset and the  \n \n           4    intensity of onset, I would say it's less than six. \n \n           5    Q    Do you know Dr. Mark Dershwitz? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 65of 116\n \n           6    A    Yes, I do. \n \n           7    Q    Did you teach Dr. Dershwitz pharmacokinetics at  \n \n           8    Northwestern? \n \n           9    A    I was the teaching assistant for the pharmacology  \n \n          10    course where we had an intense experience with  \n \n          11    pharmacokinetics.  \n \n          12    Q    Is Dr. Dershwitz considered an expert in the onset of  \n \n          13    the effect of thiopental? \n \n          14    A    No, he's not. \n \n          15    Q    Let the record reflect that the screen is now showing  \n \n          16    Figure 2 and I'm showing Figure 2 to opposing counsel.   \n \n          17              What is this, Dr. Henthorn? \n \n          18    A    This is a graph showing the difference in onset time  \n \n          19    between simple loss of consciousness as defined by loss of  \n \n          20    voice recognition to a deeper level of anesthesia. \n \n          21    Q    And how do you know what it is? \n \n          22    A    I prepared it. \n \n          23              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, plaintiff offers  \n \n          24    Figure 2, otherwise known as Exhibit 40, into evidence. \n \n          25              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             206 \n \n \n \n           1              THE COURT:  It will be received. \n \n           2    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  What does the X axis in this graph  \n \n           3    represent? \n \n           4    A    It's time and it shows the first two minutes after  \n \n           5    beginning the injection of thiopental. \n \n           6    Q    And just to be clear, the X axis is the horizontal  \n \n           7    axis? \n \n           8    A    Yes.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 66of 116\n \n           9    Q    And what does the Y axis represent? \n \n          10    A    It would be the vertical axis, and it looks at the  \n \n          11    probability of effect. \n \n          12    Q    And what probability of effect are you most interested  \n \n          13    in as an anesthesiologist? \n \n          14    A    As an anesthesiologist, and actually most clinicians,  \n \n          15    but we are interested in 95 percent probability. \n \n          16    Q    Why do you choose 95 percent? \n \n          17    A    This -- because it's, first of all, it's a standard in \n \n          18    pharmacology.  We understand the mathematics behind it.   \n \n          19    And it also means that virtually all, or the vast majority  \n \n          20    of individuals will have reacted to the drug.  So it's a  \n \n          21    good way of calibrating a dose. \n \n          22    Q    And what does the dotted line on the left represent? \n \n          23    A    The dotted line on the left is -- represents the  \n \n          24    probability of having loss of consciousness vs. time after  \n \n          25    starting infusion at time zero. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             207 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And what does the solid line on the right represent? \n \n           2    A    Basically the same thing.  Starting at time zero, but  \n \n           3    this one is looking at a deeper level of anesthesia.   \n \n           4    Specifically burst suppression. \n \n           5    Q     And again, which depth of anesthesia do you believe  \n \n           6    is necessary to assure that a person will not feel pain? \n \n           7    A    The one represented by the solid line, EEG burst  \n \n           8    suppression. \n \n           9    Q    How much longer does it take to achieve a 95 percent  \n \n          10    likelihood of burst suppression compared to achieve a 95  \n \n          11    percent likelihood of lack of voice recognition  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 67of 116\n \n          12    consciousness? \n \n          13    A    It's going to depend on a number of things, including  \n \n          14    dose.  This was modeled with a five-gram dose, so you can  \n \n          15    see with a five-gram dose it's only about 20 seconds  \n \n          16    difference. \n \n          17    Q    And how did you choose that amount of five grams? \n \n          18    A    From the Crawford affidavit saying that was the dose  \n \n          19    used in Missouri. \n \n          20    Q    If you found out that Missouri used a different amount  \n \n          21    of thiopental or that not all the thiopental that was used  \n \n          22    was delivered successfully into the inmate's veins, would  \n \n          23    that change the result? \n \n          24    A    It would -- the only result that would change would be  \n \n          25    moving the curve to the right, which would mean that the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             208 \n \n \n \n           1    effects would come on slower. \n \n           2    Q    Does this figure take into account the reduction in  \n \n           3    cardiac output that might be caused by thiopental? \n \n           4    A    No.  This -- it was simply to show the difference in  \n \n           5    time between the two kinds of effect of thiopental. \n \n           6    Q    Is a reduction in cardiac output likely? \n \n           7    A    With a five-gram dose, yes, it is. \n \n           8    Q    Why did you exclude that assumption from this graph? \n \n           9    A    This -- because it would affect both.  And the idea  \n \n          10    here was just to illustrate that there is a time  \n \n          11    differential between loss of consciousness and achieving a  \n \n          12    deeper level of anesthesia from the same dose. \n \n          13    Q    And what effect does a reduction in cardiac output  \n \n          14    have on the circulation? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 68of 116\n \n          15    A    It would slow the circulation down. \n \n          16    Q    And what effect does a reduction in circulation have  \n \n          17    on when thiopental is delivered to the brain? \n \n          18    A    It would slow that down as well, so it would take  \n \n          19    longer to take effect. \n \n          20    Q    And what effect does less thiopental in the brain have  \n \n          21    on the time it takes to reach burst suppression? \n \n          22    A    It would prolong that as well. \n \n          23    Q    Let the record reflect I'm showing Exhibit 41 to  \n \n          24    opposing counsel. \n \n          25              This is an affidavit submitted by Dr. Dershwitz  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             209 \n \n \n \n           1    in the Page case in North Carolina.  Have you read this? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    Let me read a short portion.  Dr. Dershwitz writes,  \n \n           4    \"During an execution by lethal injection\" -- \n \n           5              MR.

It continued to beat  \n \n           8    after the thiopental. \n \n           9    Q    For the record, I am now showing Figure 3, Exhibit 42,  \n \n          10    on the screen.  What does this figure represent? \n \n          11    A    This figure illustrates the effect of onset time to  \n \n          12    95 percent probability of an effect as the heart function  \n \n          13    decreases.  More specifically, that the cardiac output  \n \n          14    decreases. \n \n          15    Q    And how do you know? \n \n          16    A    I prepared this one as well. \n \n          17              MR.

I was happy to read that because I already  \n \n           9    assumed that was the case. \n \n          10              MR. BERGER:  I believe this is already in  \n \n          11    evidence. \n \n          12    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  And based on this testimony, these  \n \n          13    ECGs, would you say that Missouri generally injects the  \n \n          14    drugs extremely quickly? \n \n          15    A    Yes. \n \n          16    Q    Do you remember the Vernon Brown ECG? \n \n          17    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          18    Q    Based on the Vernon Brown ECG report, how long after  \n \n          19    the thiopental was first injected did the potassium  \n \n          20    chloride reach the veins? \n \n          21    A    I believe it was 128 seconds.  \n \n          22    Q    In your medical opinion, with any dose of thiopental,  \n \n          23    five grams or less, is it likely that burst suppression was  \n \n          24    reached by the time that potassium chloride reached the  \n \n          25    veins in the Vernon Brown case, based on those times? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             213 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 72of 116\n \n \n \n           1    A    I'm sorry.  You said any dose less?  \n \n           2    Q    Yes.  With any dose of thiopental five grams or less,  \n \n           3    is it likely that burst suppression was reached, counting  \n \n           4    in the cardiac -- the effects on cardiac output? \n \n           5    A    No. \n \n           6    Q    And from your analysis of the ECGs, is the Vernon  \n \n           7    Brown timing pretty representative of the timing of the  \n \n           8    injections in the other five -- the other four executions  \n \n           9    for which we have records and markings on the ECGs? \n \n          10    A    Yes, it was. \n \n          11    Q    And if we look at defendant Crawford's timetables for  \n \n          12    other executions for which we do not have the ECGs, are  \n \n          13    some of the timings even faster? \n \n          14    A    Yes.  There were two that -- actually No. 7 and No. 8  \n \n          15    were probably less than two minutes. \n \n          16    Q    Let the record reflect I am now showing Figure 4,  \n \n          17    Exhibit 43 on the screen.  What is this, Dr. Henthorn? \n \n          18    A    This is a graph showing when potassium is in the  \n \n          19    veins, that's the shaded part, in relation to when -- the  \n \n          20    probability of burst suppression occurring under different  \n \n          21    conditions. \n \n          22    Q    And how do you know what it is? \n \n          23    A    I prepared this one. \n \n          24              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we offer Plaintiff's  \n \n          25    Exhibit 43 into evidence. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             214 \n \n \n \n           1              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n           2              THE COURT:  It will be received. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 73of 116\n \n           3    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  How much thiopental does this graph  \n \n           4    assume? \n \n           5    A    Five grams. \n \n           6    Q    And what again does the box represent? \n \n           7    A    This would be the time that thiopental was entering  \n \n           8    the femoral vein. \n \n           9    Q    And what does the left-hand side of the box then  \n \n          10    represent? \n \n          11    A    That would be when it first arrives in the femoral  \n \n          12    vein. \n \n          13    Q    So assuming that cardiac output is unchanged by  \n \n          14    thiopental, what is the probability of thiopental achieving  \n \n          15    burst suppression when the potassium chloride reaches the  \n \n          16    veins in about one and a half minutes? \n \n          17    A    It's approximately a 98 percent certainty. \n \n          18    Q    And how can you see this on the graph? \n \n          19    A    Well, that is where the left-hand part of the box, or  \n \n          20    the left-hand edge of that box hits the solid line which  \n \n          21    represents that cardiac output has no effect -- I mean,  \n \n          22    thiopental has no effect on the cardiac output, and this  \n \n          23    would be the probabilities of achieving burst suppression.   \n \n          24    And as you can see, it's near the top of the box -- or the  \n \n          25    line, so it's about 98 percent. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             215 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    What are the chances that with a five-gram dose of  \n \n           2    thiopental there would be no effect on cardiac output?  \n \n           3    A    I think it's virtually zero. \n \n           4    Q    So if we assume that there is, say, a 25 percent  \n \n           5    reduction on cardiac output so that cardiac output is 75  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 74of 116\n \n           6    percent of the baseline, what are the chances that  \n \n           7    thiopental would have reached burst suppression when the  \n \n           8    potassium chloride reaches the veins in about a minute and  \n \n           9    a half? \n \n          10    A    That reduces it to -- it's now 75 percent.  \n \n          11    Q    And if we assume that there is a 50 percent reduction  \n \n          12    in cardiac output, so that cardiac output is 50 percent of  \n \n          13    the baseline, what are the chances that the thiopental  \n \n          14    would have reached burst suppression when the potassium  \n \n          15    chloride reaches the veins in a minute and a half? \n \n          16    A    As you can see, these are very steep curves, and at  \n \n          17    this point the probability is about two or three percent. \n \n          18    Q    And if we assume that there's a 75 percent reduction  \n \n          19    in cardiac output, so that cardiac output is 25 percent of  \n \n          20    the baseline, what are the chances thiopental would have  \n \n          21    reached burst suppression when the potassium chloride  \n \n          22    enters the veins? \n \n          23    A    It would be infinitesimally small. \n \n          24    Q    And again, is it likely that there will be some effect  \n \n          25    on cardiac output with a five-gram dose? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             216 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I think it's a virtual certainty. \n \n           2    Q    With a five-gram dose would you expect that effect on  \n \n           3    cardiac output to be big or small? \n \n           4    A    I would expect it to be large. \n \n           5    Q    So would you expect that the reduction in cardiac  \n \n           6    output following a dose of that size would likely be  \n \n           7    somewhere between 50 and 75 percent? \n \n           8    A    It would be at least 50 percent, in my best medical  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 75of 116\n \n           9    opinion. \n \n          10    Q    And possibly more? \n \n          11    A    And possibly more. \n \n          12    Q    And assuming such a reduction in cardiac output, is  \n \n          13    it likely that the thiopental will have achieved burst  \n \n          14    suppression at one and a half minutes when the potassium  \n \n          15    chloride reached the veins in Vernon Brown's execution? \n \n          16    A    It would be very unlikely. \n \n          17    Q    And once again, is the timing of the injection of  \n \n          18    thiopental and potassium chloride in the Vernon Brown  \n \n          19    execution typical of the timing of the other -- of the  \n \n          20    injections in the other executions you have reviewed? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    Is Figure 4 up on the screen, Exhibit 43, identical  \n \n          23    to what was known as Figure 5 which was attached to your  \n \n          24    expert report, representing the same thing? \n \n          25    A    No. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             217 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    What changed on it? \n \n           2    A    Well, the main thing that changed was that it became  \n \n           3    clear after reviewing the ECG records that the injection  \n \n           4    time was not one minute as it had been on the record, on  \n \n           5    the handwritten record, just writing the times that the  \n \n           6    injection began and ended.  I used those initially and it  \n \n           7    was one minute. \n \n           8              When you actually look at the ECG it's almost  \n \n           9    exactly 30 seconds.  So I sped up the injection time for  \n \n          10    these. \n \n          11    Q    So does the new graph make your findings more  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 76of 116\n \n          12    accurate? \n \n          13    A    I believe they do. \n \n          14    Q    And would it be fair to say that the new graph is more  \n \n          15    in favor of the state than the old graph was? \n \n          16    A    Yes, it is. \n \n          17    Q    Now, what is the probability of burst suppression if  \n \n          18    there is no change in cardiac output, in the new graph? \n \n          19    A    I'm sorry?  \n \n          20    Q    Am I correct that you just said the probability of  \n \n          21    burst suppression in the new graph, if there is no change  \n \n          22    in cardiac output, is about 98 percent? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    Do you remember what it was in the old graph? \n \n          25    A    I think it was closer to 60 percent. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             218 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And in the new graph, what is the likelihood of burst  \n \n           2    suppression if cardiac output is at 50 percent? \n \n           3    A    It's two percent. \n \n           4    Q    And what is the probability of burst suppression at  \n \n           5    50 percent in the old graph? \n \n           6    A    I believe it was also quite small, but I don't  \n \n           7    remember the number. \n \n           8    Q    But would it have been less than -- \n \n           9    A    It was less than two percent, yes. \n \n          10    Q    And again, what is the probability of burst  \n \n          11    suppression -- strike that.  How likely is it that a  \n \n          12    five-gram dose of thiopental will have a 50 percent effect  \n \n          13    on cardiac output, or more? \n \n          14    A    I think it's very likely. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 77of 116\n \n          15    Q    Have you reviewed the chemical log provided by the  \n \n          16    state? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \n \n          18    Q    Do you remember what amount of thiopental was  \n \n          19    indicated for the Marlin Gray execution?  Let me show it to  \n \n          20    you.  Do you remember -- in those last two executions how  \n \n          21    much thiopental was used, according to the chemical log? \n \n          22    A    2.5. \n \n          23    Q    And what effect will a reduced dose of thiopental have  \n \n          24    on the time it takes for thiopental to reach burst  \n \n          25    suppression? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             219 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It will prolong the time. \n \n           2    Q    And have you read the letter of the state admitting  \n \n           3    that they used 2.5 grams? \n \n           4    A    Yes.   \n \n           5              MR. BERGER:  Let the record reflect that I'm  \n \n           6    showing opposing counsel Plaintiff's Exhibit 44.   \n \n           7    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Is this that letter, Dr. Henthorn? \n \n           8    A    Yes. \n \n           9              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we move to admit  \n \n          10    Plaintiff's Exhibit 44. \n \n          11              MR. PRITCHETT:  I think it's already in the  \n \n          12    record, but to the extent it needs to be admitted as an  \n \n          13    exhibit we don't object. \n \n          14              THE COURT:  Okay.  \n \n          15    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  And you have already said that you  \n \n          16    have reviewed portions of John Doe One's deposition? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 78of 116\n \n          18    Q    And if we turn to that deposition, at page 21, he  \n \n          19    says, \"I'll get out five.  I'll use 2.5.\"  And at page 30,  \n \n          20    he says, \"I do remember when we used only 2.5.\" \n \n          21              Based on your understanding of John Doe One's  \n \n          22    deposition testimony, has Missouri given a five-gram dose  \n \n          23    of thiopental in any of the past six executions? \n \n          24    A    No. \n \n          25    Q    Can you tell how much thiopental he actually gave? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             220 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    If we assume that he gave 2.5, let's -- let the record  \n \n           3    reflect that the screen now shows Figure 5, which is  \n \n           4    Plaintiff's Exhibit 45, which assumes a 2.5 gram dose.  Can  \n \n           5    you briefly describe what this is? \n \n           6    A    This is very similar to the last graph.  It shows  \n \n           7    the -- when the potassium was in the vein in relation to  \n \n           8    the probability of achieving an effect. \n \n           9    Q    And how do you know what it is? \n \n          10    A    I prepared this one. \n \n          11              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we offer Plaintiff's  \n \n          12    Exhibit 45 into evidence. \n \n          13              MR. PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n          14              THE COURT:  Received. \n \n          15    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  And again, what amount of thiopental  \n \n          16    does this figure assume? \n \n          17    A    2.5 grams. \n \n          18    Q    So assuming this 2.5 grams of thiopental and that  \n \n          19    cardiac output is unchanged by thiopental, what is the  \n \n          20    probability of thiopental achieving burst suppression in  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 79of 116\n \n          21    1.5 minutes? \n \n          22    A    It's about 75 percent. \n \n          23    Q    If we then assume 25 percent reduction in cardiac  \n \n          24    output, what are the chances it would have gotten to burst  \n \n          25    suppression at that point? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             221 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It's about seven or eight percent. \n \n           2    Q    And with a 50 percent reduction? \n \n           3    A    It's less than one percent. \n \n           4    Q    And with a 75 percent reduction? \n \n           5    A    Again, it's infinitesimally small. \n \n           6    Q    And is it likely that there will be some effect on  \n \n           7    cardiac output with a 2.5 gram dose? \n \n           8    A    Yes.  This is still a very large dose.  Again -- not  \n \n           9    again, but these doses are not well-studied.  Clinical  \n \n          10    doses are well-studied and those produce a reduction in  \n \n          11    cardiac output.  So there is every probability that there  \n \n          12    will be a substantial reduction in cardiac output from 2.5. \n \n          13    Q    And roughly what change in cardiac output do you  \n \n          14    consider most likely with a 2.5 gram dose? \n \n          15    A    Based on what I have observed with thiopental in  \n \n          16    the past I would say 50 percent.  It's very likely, and  \n \n          17    conservative. \n \n          18    Q    And with any of those scenarios with reduced cardiac  \n \n          19    output, is it likely that the 2.5 grams of thiopental here  \n \n          20    would have achieved burst suppression at one and a half  \n \n          21    minutes when the potassium chloride was injected -- entered  \n \n          22    Vernon Brown's veins? \n \n          23    A    No. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 80of 116\n \n          24    Q    Let the record reflect the screen now shows  \n \n          25    Plaintiff's Exhibit 46, which is Figure 6.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             222 \n \n \n \n           1              Please describe what this is. \n \n           2    A    Almost identical to the last graph.

PRITCHETT:  No objection. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  It will be received. \n \n          11    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  And based on your reading of John Doe  \n \n          12    One's deposition transcript, do you think he actually used  \n \n          13    2.5 grams? \n \n          14    A    I think it would be very difficult, based on his  \n \n          15    description of what he was doing, to actually get the full  \n \n          16    content of every syringe withdrawn and put into another  \n \n          17    syringe, so I think it's probably less. \n \n          18    Q    So if we assume a two-gram dose, what are the chances  \n \n          19    that the thiopental would have achieved burst suppression  \n \n          20    before the potassium chloride reaches the veins at 1.5  \n \n          21    minutes? \n \n          22    A    Again, with no change in cardiac output, the  \n \n          23    probability has now fallen to just under 40 percent. \n \n          24    Q    And with a two-gram dose, do you consider a change in  \n \n          25    cardiac output likely? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             223 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 81of 116\n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes. \n \n           2    Q    And with a change in cardiac output, with a 25 percent  \n \n           3    change in cardiac output, what would be the likelihood of  \n \n           4    burst suppression? \n \n           5    A    It's about three percent. \n \n           6    Q    And with a 50 percent change? \n \n           7    A    It's way less than one percent. \n \n           8    Q    And with a 75 percent change? \n \n           9    A    Again it's -- it has actually fallen to even more than  \n \n          10    infinitesimal. \n \n          11    Q    And what change in cardiac output would you expect to  \n \n          12    be most likely with a two-gram dose? \n \n          13    A    Again, I don't think it would be substantially  \n \n          14    different from the 2.5 gram dose.  I think it would be  \n \n          15    in the neighborhood of 50 percent. \n \n          16    Q    And is the dose of thiopental necessary to model the  \n \n          17    onset effect of thiopental? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    So if you don't know the dose, can you know the time  \n \n          20    it takes effect? \n \n          21    A    No.  You will know that -- regardless of dose, you  \n \n          22    will know when it reaches the arteries, but the next step,  \n \n          23    which is the diffusion into the brain, is dependent on  \n \n          24    concentration, so a bigger dose produces higher  \n \n          25    concentrations so it would speed things up, and a smaller  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             224 \n \n \n \n           1    dose would slow things down. \n \n           2    Q    So assuming that whoever is mixing the thiopental does  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 82of 116\n \n           3    not know exactly what amount he is mixing, can that person  \n \n           4    know when the thiopental will take effect? \n \n           5    A    It's unlikely. \n \n           6    Q    And even if a person knows how much he's mixing, if  \n \n           7    the full amount of the thiopental that has been mixed is  \n \n           8    not delivered successfully into the person's veins, is it  \n \n           9    possible to know when the thiopental will take effect? \n \n          10    A    No. \n \n          11    Q    Assume that the thiopental did not achieve burst  \n \n          12    suppression and that a patient or an inmate suffered pain,  \n \n          13    let's assume it's an inmate, how likely is it that a  \n \n          14    participant in an execution would be able to see that pain? \n \n          15    A    I think it would be unlikely. \n \n          16    Q    What effect might thiopental have that could prevent  \n \n          17    an onlooker from being able to see an inmate's pain? \n \n          18    A    Well, already before the pain would arrive, they would  \n \n          19    have been relaxed and their ability to respond would be  \n \n          20    curtailed. \n \n          21    Q    Will it be harder for a witness to see the pain if  \n \n          22    they're looking through a window from another room? \n \n          23    A    Yes, I believe so. \n \n          24    Q    Would it be harder to see the pain if there's a sheet  \n \n          25    covering the inmate? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             225 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes. \n \n           2    Q    And would it be harder to see the pain if there's a  \n \n           3    venetian blind partially drawn over the window? \n \n           4    A    Yes to that as well. \n \n           5    Q    In making the models that we have just reviewed,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 83of 116\n \n           6    Dr. Henthorn, do you have to make certain assumptions? \n \n           7    A    Yes. \n \n           8    Q    Are these assumptions discussed in your expert report? \n \n           9    A    Yes, they are. \n \n          10    Q    Did you choose eight feet of tubing? \n \n          11    A    Yes. \n \n          12    Q    Why did you choose that amount of tubing?  \n \n          13    A    That was based on the report from the Department of  \n \n          14    Corrections. \n \n          15    Q    And did you choose seven and a half second mean  \n \n          16    transit time to reach the patient? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \n \n          18    Q    And why did you choose seven and a half second mean  \n \n          19    transit time? \n \n          20    A    Well, the dead space, again from the report from  \n \n          21    Missouri, was that the dead space of that eight feet of  \n \n          22    tubing was 15 milliliters.  So dividing the 15 milliliters  \n \n          23    by two milliliters (sic) per second would give you a mean  \n \n          24    time for injection would be 7.5. \n \n          25    Q    And did you choose an injection speed of two cc's per  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             226 \n \n \n \n           1    second? \n \n           2    A    I did in these revised graphs, yes. \n \n           3    Q    And why did you choose that injection speed? \n \n           4    A    Well, because that's what Mr. Crawford said, first of  \n \n           5    all.  And second, if you look at the ECG and look at the  \n \n           6    timing as marked from the beginning of the injection to the  \n \n           7    end of the injection, it is remarkably close to the time of  \n \n           8    two cc's per second.  A 60 cc syringe is emptied in about  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 84of 116\n \n           9    30 seconds. \n \n          10    Q    And did you choose a 12-second mean transit time from  \n \n          11    the femoral vein to the heart? \n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    And why did you choose that? \n \n          14    A    That was based on the diameter of the vena cava  \n \n          15    and the length of the vena cava giving a volume of  \n \n          16    approximately 600 cc's.  And that half of the cardiac  \n \n          17    output would be going through the vena cava.  You have to  \n \n          18    realize that the vena cava picks up speed as it gets closer  \n \n          19    to the heart, so it would probably be less than half the  \n \n          20    cardiac output at the beginning and more than half at the  \n \n          21    end, but on average it should be about half. \n \n          22    Q    And do you assume normal cardiac output of five liters  \n \n          23    per minute? \n \n          24    A    Yes.   \n \n          25    Q    Why? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             227 \n \n \n \n           1    A    This is based on my own experiments.  When we looked  \n \n           2    at individuals very carefully in pharmacokinetic studies,  \n \n           3    this was a resting male around 80 kilos has a cardiac  \n \n           4    output at rest of approximately five liters per minute. \n \n           5    Q    And you assumed about an 80, 82 kilogram healthy male  \n \n           6    inmate? \n \n           7    A    Yes.  My experiment actually I believe was 82 and I \n \n           8    think Dr. Dershwitz is assuming 80 kilos.  There would be  \n \n           9    really no difference between the two. \n \n          10    Q    And do you assume essential blood volume of 2.5  \n \n          11    liters? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 85of 116\n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    Why do you assume that blood volume? \n \n          14    A    Approximately a quarter to a third or even half of the  \n \n          15    blood volume can be in the thorax.  And certainly when  \n \n          16    someone is recumbent that number goes higher. \n \n          17              The other thing you have to understand is when  \n \n          18    I am modeling thiopental, it's more than just the blood  \n \n          19    volume.  There would be an interaction of the drug.  It  \n \n          20    diffuses into the lung on its passage through the lung and  \n \n          21    it would pick up an additional volume there, so there's an  \n \n          22    additional 500 cc's. \n \n          23    Q    So in your medical opinion, does Missouri's injection  \n \n          24    times allow enough time for the thiopental to take full  \n \n          25    effect before the potassium chloride enters the veins? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             228 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    And in your medical opinion, do you think the lethal  \n \n           3    injection procedure causes significant risk of unnecessary  \n \n           4    pain? \n \n           5    A    Yes, I do. \n \n           6    Q    And if Missouri waited another two minutes after  \n \n           7    injecting the thiopental before injecting the next drug,  \n \n           8    could it substantially reduce the risk of pain? \n \n           9    A    Very much so, yes. \n \n          10    Q    And are there any drawbacks in waiting this additional  \n \n          11    time to allow the thiopental to take effect? \n \n          12    A    None that I can think of. \n \n          13    Q    In your work as an anesthesiologist, do you place  \n \n          14    central lines? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 86of 116\n \n          15    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          16    Q    And in your work as an anesthesiologist, do you make  \n \n          17    decisions about whether to place a central line or  \n \n          18    peripheral line? \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    Are you aware that Missouri injects these chemicals  \n \n          21    through a femoral line? \n \n          22    A    Yes. \n \n          23    Q    Would you ever select a femoral line as your first  \n \n          24    option for injecting these drugs if the peripheral veins  \n \n          25    were not compromised? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             229 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No, I would not. \n \n           2    Q    Does the femoral line create the possibility of more  \n \n           3    complications than the peripheral line? \n \n           4    A    Yes. \n \n           5    Q    Can these complications be painful? \n \n           6    A    Yes. \n \n           7    Q    Can some of these complications be very painful? \n \n           8    A    I believe so, yes. \n \n           9    Q    How often do these complications arise with femoral  \n \n          10    insertions? \n \n          11    A    I would say slightly less than 20 percent. \n \n          12    Q    Do the drugs take effect much quicker if they are  \n \n          13    injected into a femoral line rather than a peripheral line? \n \n          14    A    No. \n \n          15    Q    So does the femoral line injection make the thiopental  \n \n          16    take effect more quickly than with a peripheral injection  \n \n          17    so that burst suppression will be achieved before the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 87of 116\n \n          18    injection of the potassium chloride? \n \n          19    A    No, not substantially. \n \n          20              MR.

If you notice  \n \n           3    there's -- on the left there's a sponge that's almost  \n \n           4    completely soaked, and it's soaked in bright red blood.   \n \n           5    Also you note above the tip of catheter some bluish  \n \n           6    discoloration and some swelling. \n \n           7    Q    What do you think happened here, Dr. Henthorn? \n \n           8    A    It's impossible to know for sure just by looking at  \n \n           9    this one photo, but my best guess is that perhaps the  \n \n          10    artery was punctured and the blood coming back was bright  \n \n          11    red, and in a large amount, because the arteries are under  \n \n          12    high pressure. \n \n          13    Q    And what are you basing this view on? \n \n          14    A    Experience, having seen arteries punctured in the  \n \n          15    past. \n \n          16    Q    Could this be painful? \n \n          17    A    Yes, it can be painful. \n \n          18    Q    Is this the kind of complication -- is this kind of  \n \n          19    complication unusual with a femoral line insertion? \n \n          20    A    I think this is one of the more common complications,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 88of 116\n \n          21    because the femoral vein and the femoral artery run right  \n \n          22    next to each other.  It's very difficult to always be  \n \n          23    certain when you're placing a needle in the groin that  \n \n          24    you're going to hit the right structure. \n \n          25    Q    Is this kind of complication possible with a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             231 \n \n \n \n           1    peripheral line insertion? \n \n           2    A    No. \n \n           3    Q    Do you see a hematoma in this picture? \n \n           4    A    Well, I believe so.  As I say, just to -- above the  \n \n           5    catheter insertion site there is some purplish  \n \n           6    discoloration and some swelling. \n \n           7    Q    What makes you think that's a hematoma? \n \n           8    A    Well, it's right where you put the needle, so it would  \n \n           9    be likely that this would be a hematoma and not something  \n \n          10    else, because if there was a hematoma it would be right  \n \n          11    there.  It's also because -- what you usually see with a  \n \n          12    hematoma is some discoloration under the skin and some  \n \n          13    swelling.  This seems to have both. \n \n          14    Q    And in addition to the complications you have just  \n \n          15    discussed as probable in the Johnston photo, what other  \n \n          16    complications can arise from a femoral line insertion? \n \n          17    A    Well, first of all, I want to say I'm not an expert on  \n \n          18    femoral line insertion.  Most of my insertions are higher  \n \n          19    up in the neck or the subclavian.  But as with any line  \n \n          20    placement, there's the potential for hitting an artery and  \n \n          21    causing a hematoma.  There is potential for hitting the  \n \n          22    vein and going through the back wall and causing a  \n \n          23    hematoma.  That can be what this is from as well.  Less   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 89of 116\n \n          24    likely would be hitting the femoral nerve.  And as you can  \n \n          25    also tell, we're very close, within an inch or two, of the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             232 \n \n \n \n           1    pelvis, and it's possible to place the needle into the  \n \n           2    pelvic structure such as the bladder, et cetera. \n \n           3    Q    And once again, how likely collectively are these  \n \n           4    complications? \n \n           5    A    I believe there's a paper in -- well, I have seen a  \n \n           6    paper in the Journal of American Medical Association by  \n \n           7    More - ray (phonetic spelling), and it's approximately one  \n \n           8    in six. \n \n           9    Q    And are these complications painful? \n \n          10    A    Some of them can be.  I mean, a hematoma is going to  \n \n          11    cause pain just from the swelling alone. \n \n          12    Q    And are some of them very painful? \n \n          13    A    I have seen people require treatment of these  \n \n          14    hematomas with painkillers.  So I would say that's pretty  \n \n          15    painful. \n \n          16              MR. BERGER:  One moment.   \n \n          17              No further questions, Your Honor.   \n \n          18    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PRITCHETT:  \n \n          19    Q    Good afternoon, Doctor.  My Name is Mike Pritchett.   \n \n          20    I'm here representing the state in this case. \n \n          21    A    Okay.  Thank you. \n \n          22    Q    I'd like to start out, if I could, with some areas  \n \n          23    where I think you will agree with Dr. Dershwitz' position.   \n \n          24    Don't you agree that the administration of five grams of  \n \n          25    thiopental will produce unconsciousness in any human being  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             233 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 90of 116\n \n \n \n           1    for many hours? \n \n           2    A    I would agree with the first part of the statement,   \n \n           3    in virtually every individual.  And I would take some  \n \n           4    exception with the duration, if you're defining it based  \n \n           5    on burst suppression vs. some lesser definition of  \n \n           6    consciousness, unconsciousness, but otherwise, yes, for  \n \n           7    a very long time. \n \n           8    Q    Could you tell us how long you think burst suppression  \n \n           9    would last with a five-gram dose of thiopental? \n \n          10    A    Well, one way to approach that very quickly is knowing  \n \n          11    the half-life of the drug is six hours and you're looking  \n \n          12    at two decrements of half life.  Of course, there's some  \n \n          13    redistribution going on as well.  So in my best opinion  \n \n          14    without having performed the simulation, I don't have a  \n \n          15    computer in front of me so I don't know, but I would say it  \n \n          16    would be 45 minutes at least. \n \n          17    Q    Wouldn't you agree also that a dose down even as low  \n \n          18    as 1.67 grams will produce a state of deep unconsciousness  \n \n          19    in almost all people? \n \n          20    A    Yes, it would produce even burst suppression in almost  \n \n          21    everyone. \n \n          22    Q    And is it correct to say that you have no argument  \n \n          23    with the affidavit that's been provided by Dr. Dershwitz  \n \n          24    about the time frame of about four minutes after the  \n \n          25    administration of the thiopental until -- well, through the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             234 \n \n \n \n           1    next five hours? \n \n           2    A    Yes, except for the definition of unconsciousness.   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 91of 116\n \n           3    That's going to affect the calculation slightly. \n \n           4    Q    Okay.  But as a general matter, the -- \n \n           5    A    As a general matter, he did a good job on that. \n \n           6    Q    So your conclusion, I think, is that an administration  \n \n           7    of five grams of thiopental will obtain burst suppression  \n \n           8    after what amount of time?  Let's assume your best guess of  \n \n           9    50 degree cardiac output reduction. \n \n          10    A    Well, again, I would like to refer to the graph, but  \n \n          11    I'm going to say that it was just under -- around two  \n \n          12    minutes. \n \n          13    Q    Would you like to see the graph? \n \n          14    A    That would be great.  Thank you. \n \n          15    Q    I'm referring to what I think is Figure 4.   \n \n          16              MR. PRITCHETT:  If we could either get a copy for  \n \n          17    the doctor or call it up on the machine.  It's the one  \n \n          18    titled, I think, onset of thiopental effect, probability of  \n \n          19    effect, 5.0 gram dose. \n \n          20    Q    And we're looking at -- I'm looking at your view as to  \n \n          21    when burst suppression, the 95 percent chance of burst  \n \n          22    suppression, is likely to happen on your best guess with 50  \n \n          23    percent cardiac output reduction.  \n \n          24    A    It looks like about a minute and 40 seconds. \n \n          25    Q    And in order for us to trace that, we would go to the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             235 \n \n \n \n           1    line that equates to the 50 percent baseline, which is the  \n \n           2    third one from the right? \n \n           3    A    Correct. \n \n           4    Q    And we would just follow up that line until we hit  \n \n           5    95 percent on the left axis.  Am I right? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 92of 116\n \n           6    A    You're right. \n \n           7    Q    Thank you.  And then with the five-gram dose of  \n \n           8    thiopental, we're presuming burst suppression would last,  \n \n           9    did you tell us 45 minutes at least? \n \n          10    A    At a minimum. \n \n          11    Q    At a minimum? \n \n          12    A    I think it was probably closer to Dr. Dershwitz'  \n \n          13    calculations. \n \n          14    Q    You have chosen burst suppression as the level of  \n \n          15    unconsciousness that should be achieved before the  \n \n          16    administration of potassium chloride, am I correct? \n \n          17    A    Correct. \n \n          18    Q    Burst suppression is a very deep state of  \n \n          19    unconsciousness, isn't it? \n \n          20    A    Yes.  It's complete unconsciousness. \n \n          21    Q    Isn't it true that burst suppression is even a deeper  \n \n          22    level of unconsciousness than is achieved during -- of a  \n \n          23    person undergoing surgical procedures? \n \n          24    A    Yes.  It can be reached at times, but it's not --  \n \n          25    certainly isn't the target. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             236 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    So in surgical procedures where a person is being cut  \n \n           2    into, the target is not as low as burst suppression? \n \n           3    A    Correct.  But you have to realize that in that  \n \n           4    situation there's an expert in anesthesia monitoring very  \n \n           5    closely.  In the absence of monitors or someone who is an  \n \n           6    expert, I think a higher level is necessary. \n \n           7    Q    Once you have reached burst suppression, which you  \n \n           8    have indicated with your best estimate of the 50 percent  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 93of 116\n \n           9    cardiac reduction occurring at somewhere around a minute  \n \n          10    and I think you said -- somewhere between a minute and a  \n \n          11    half and two minutes? \n \n          12    A    Right. \n \n          13    Q    Once you hit burst suppression, even under your own  \n \n          14    definition of the appropriate state of consciousness, is  \n \n          15    there any need at that point to have any monitoring of  \n \n          16    the level of consciousness if the person is going to be  \n \n          17    at burst suppression for the next 45 minutes to a few  \n \n          18    hours? \n \n          19    A    Well, what you would also need is some determination  \n \n          20    that the effect is occurring, so you would need to see the  \n \n          21    trajectory of the effect.  So to be sure the drug has  \n \n          22    reached the brain, you need to see some effect.  Once you  \n \n          23    have seen some effect, then I believe waiting the  \n \n          24    appropriate amount of time would be reasonable. \n \n          25    Q    So assuming the individual, the condemned prisoner,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             237 \n \n \n \n           1    actually gets a five-gram dose, once you get burst  \n \n           2    suppression, once the condemned prisoner gets to burst  \n \n           3    suppression, there's no longer any need to monitor.  It's  \n \n           4    just a matter of realizing whether the inmate is at that  \n \n           5    level? \n \n           6    A    Correct.  Because that would last a long time. \n \n           7    Q    Do you have any reason to believe that in executions  \n \n           8    in Missouri, whatever dose of thiopental has been given,  \n \n           9    it's not fully being entered into the inmate's circulatory  \n \n          10    system? \n \n          11    A    I haven't seen evidence actually one way or the other. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 94of 116\n \n          12    Q    Okay.  So you wouldn't tell me -- you wouldn't argue  \n \n          13    with me that it's not happening, but you couldn't tell me  \n \n          14    you're sure it is happening.  \n \n          15    A    Exactly. \n \n          16    Q    You have indicated that Dr. Dershwitz chose a level of  \n \n          17    unconsciousness that I think you call the voice command  \n \n          18    level. \n \n          19    A    Correct. \n \n          20    Q    Were you able -- did you read the testimony from the  \n \n          21    trial at the end -- the first part of this trial at the end  \n \n          22    of January from Dr. Dershwitz? \n \n          23    A    I did, yes. \n \n          24    Q    And an affidavit was presented.  And is it your  \n \n          25    recollection -- isn't it your recollection that his  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             238 \n \n \n \n           1    statements with regard to how long a person would be  \n \n           2    unconscious would -- the person would be unconscious and  \n \n           3    unable to experience pain?   \n \n           4    A    Correct. \n \n           5    Q    So a level of unable to experience pain is a level  \n \n           6    below voice command unconsciousness, isn't it? \n \n           7    A    Maybe I answered that incorrectly. \n \n           8    Q    Okay.  Do you have a recollection of the framing of  \n \n           9    those questions as to whether it was -- \n \n          10    A    Well, what I have a recollection of are his graphs,  \n \n          11    and what he shows on the graphs is that the 50 percent  \n \n          12    probability corresponds to the effect side concentration or  \n \n          13    brain level that would be required to produce loss of voice  \n \n          14    command.  So I'm looking at the actual data he has in his  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 95of 116\n \n          15    graph to form that opinion.  I really wasn't thinking  \n \n          16    exactly the wording that he said. \n \n          17    Q    Okay.  But we can rely on what the transcript says for  \n \n          18    that, presumably.   \n \n          19              In terms of being able to monitor the condemned  \n \n          20    inmate, you gave us some opinions based on a couple of  \n \n          21    still photographs.  Were you able to have the opportunity  \n \n          22    to see the videotape of the execution room that was taken a  \n \n          23    few weeks ago? \n \n          24    A    No. \n \n          25    Q    One of the photographs you saw was looking through the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             239 \n \n \n \n           1    window kind of straight on at not an inmate but a person on  \n \n           2    the bed.   \n \n           3              MR. PRITCHETT:  And if you wouldn't mind, I know  \n \n           4    there's two photographs that you have used, still photos.   \n \n           5    There was one looking straight through the window and then  \n \n           6    there was one off to the side.  Yeah, this photograph here.   \n \n           7    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  That's looking straight down from  \n \n           8    the top of the person's head through the window, correct? \n \n           9    A    Yes. \n \n          10    Q    And then the other photograph, if you wouldn't mind,  \n \n          11    that's a side view, and I understand that from the still  \n \n          12    photograph we really can't see very well, but isn't this an  \n \n          13    angle from which the aspect of an individual in that bed  \n \n          14    could be determined by a person looking at him? \n \n          15    A    The aspect perhaps, yes. \n \n          16    Q    Isn't that one of the things that an anesthesiologist  \n \n          17    would do in assessing anesthetic depth? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 96of 116\n \n          18    A    It's one of the very lowest things that we would use.   \n \n          19    It's very unreliable. \n \n          20    Q    But it is a step? \n \n          21    A    It's a step.  We use any information we can get. \n \n          22    Q    You have had to make some assumptions, haven't you,  \n \n          23    with regard to the effect of huge doses, two and a half to  \n \n          24    five grams of thiopental, on human cardiac output? \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             240 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Okay.  Isn't it true that the magnitude of the effect  \n \n           2    of these kinds of large doses of thiopental is something  \n \n           3    that has not been well researched? \n \n           4    A    Correct. \n \n           5    Q    And the effect of these large doses is poorly  \n \n           6    documented? \n \n           7    A    Absolutely.   \n \n           8    Q    So isn't actually the degree to which the heart will  \n \n           9    be affected in the minutes following a massive dose of  \n \n          10    thiopental a matter of some speculation?  \n \n          11    A    Yes, and that's why I provided various curves. \n \n          12    Q    Okay.  And isn't it also true that the time it takes  \n \n          13    for a massive dose of thiopental to begin to decrease  \n \n          14    cardiac output is a matter of some speculation as well? \n \n          15    A    Well, it would be the same -- the way I approached  \n \n          16    this was that the material will be in the arteries for sure  \n \n          17    by the time I started modeling at one minute. \n \n          18              And also I have had many occasions to have  \n \n          19    patients on continuous cardiac output monitors and watch  \n \n          20    what happens with clinical doses, and the changes begin at  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 97of 116\n \n          21    45 seconds or a minute or so.  So it's not unreasonable to  \n \n          22    use that as a basis. \n \n          23    Q    You're making some extrapolations, though, without any  \n \n          24    hard data.  \n \n          25    A    Absolutely. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             241 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    So at least to some degree your conclusions here with  \n \n           2    regard to the amount of time it would take for thiopental  \n \n           3    to diffuse through the brain is based on some speculation? \n \n           4    A    Well, there would be some -- yes, there is some  \n \n           5    speculation, but as I said, I have seen clinical doses do  \n \n           6    this in healthy people.  And also we can see from the  \n \n           7    potassium chloride injection and when it starts to have an  \n \n           8    effect on the circulation.  It's in the right ballpark. \n \n           9    Q    Now, next I'd like to look at a couple of the figures  \n \n          10    that you have done and if you would bear with me.  The  \n \n          11    numbers of the figures have changed a bit from the initial  \n \n          12    report you gave so it's going to take me a minute to try to  \n \n          13    sort out which is which. \n \n          14              What was Figure 6, assuming a 2.5 gram dose of  \n \n          15    thiopental, I think is Figure 5 now.  If we could call that  \n \n          16    up, please.   \n \n          17              Even with a dose of thiopental at the 2.5 gram  \n \n          18    dose reduces cardiac output to 25 percent of the baseline  \n \n          19    of normal, doesn't your graph show that a 95 percent chance  \n \n          20    of burst suppression still occurs at something just over  \n \n          21    two and a half minutes? \n \n          22    A    Oh, okay.  Yes. \n \n          23    Q    And did you do, and I don't know that this was  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 98of 116\n \n          24    introduced, did you do an approximation of a 1.67 gram dose  \n \n          25    of thiopental? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             242 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, I did. \n \n           2    Q    Do you recall when burst suppression on that occurred  \n \n           3    with regard to the maximum reduction of 75 percent of  \n \n           4    normal? \n \n           5    A    No, not specifically, but I would assume it would be  \n \n           6    later than even two and a half minutes.  What I believe it  \n \n           7    was very close to was that maximum concentration had to be  \n \n           8    reached for a dose in that range, so -- when the peak  \n \n           9    effect occurs with thiopental, so I'm guessing it's very  \n \n          10    close to three minutes. \n \n          11    Q    Okay.  Still something short of three minutes, though? \n \n          12    A    Probably, yes. \n \n          13    Q    I guess since we do have this as an exhibit, the  \n \n          14    2.0 gram dose, 95 percent burst suppression -- \n \n          15    A    Go to the next one. \n \n          16    Q    Even at the maximum effect it might have a 75 percent  \n \n          17    reduction, we're still hitting 95 percent with a two-gram  \n \n          18    dose short of three minutes, aren't we? \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    Would it be possible to track the effect of  \n \n          21    thiopental, a large dose of thiopental by means of the  \n \n          22    EKG strips you've seen? \n \n          23    A    The EKGs, no.  Well, I answered very rapidly and said  \n \n          24    no, but one of the things you can see when there's a  \n \n          25    cardiac effect of thiopental is an increase in the heart  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             243 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 99of 116\n \n \n \n           1    rate as it is compensating for a decrease in cardiac  \n \n           2    output, but it's not reliable.  You'll see it sometimes but  \n \n           3    not others.  But I do recollect seeing that on one or two  \n \n           4    of the inmates. \n \n           5    Q    Would that compensate, a more rapid heart beat, for  \n \n           6    the suppression of the function? \n \n           7    A    Exactly.  Cardiac output is a function of stroke  \n \n           8    volume, which is the force of the contraction. \n \n           9    Q    If the heart sped up as a result, the heart rate  \n \n          10    increased, would that alter your conclusions and your  \n \n          11    figures? \n \n          12    A    No.  It would indicate to me there was a reduction  \n \n          13    in cardiac output, there was an attempt by the body to  \n \n          14    compensate.  It probably can't compensate for something  \n \n          15    that large, but it was trying.  It detected it. \n \n          16    Q    Are you aware of a recent execution that occurred in  \n \n          17    North Carolina in which the condemned prisoner was  \n \n          18    monitored by means of a BIS monitor? \n \n          19    A    I was made aware of that by Mr. Berger. \n \n          20    Q    And can you tell us what a BIS monitor is? \n \n          21    A    It's a bispectral indexed specroscopy, I believe. \n \n          22    Q    What are they used for, generally? \n \n          23    A    They're used during anesthesia to monitor depth of  \n \n          24    anesthesia. \n \n          25    Q    Is it a scale 0 to 100? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             244 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It is, but it's a nonlinear scale. \n \n           2    Q    Okay.  By that, I understand it makes sort of an  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 100of 116\n \n           3    S-curve? \n \n           4    A    Well, that, and I guess the other thing to say, it's a  \n \n           5    nonparametric, and what I mean by that, a value of 30 is  \n \n           6    not half the value of 60.   \n \n           7    Q    I understand. \n \n           8    A    Okay. \n \n           9    Q    At what level in surgery is targeted on a BIS monitor? \n \n          10    A    Well, it would vary based on the stimulus being used. \n \n          11    Q    Let's say a hernia operation.  \n \n          12    A    We probably would be in the 40 or 50 range. \n \n          13    Q    Does burst suppression equate to a number on the  \n \n          14    BIS monitor? \n \n          15    A    Not really.  Although there is some question of  \n \n          16    whether it can recognize a flat line EEG.  When zero pops  \n \n          17    up it might mean that there's an isoelectric EEG, but it's  \n \n          18    not designed for that.   \n \n          19    Q    Are you aware of the readings of the BIS monitor after  \n \n          20    the thiopental was injected into the inmate in North  \n \n          21    Carolina? \n \n          22    A    No. \n \n          23    Q    If it had been reported that the BIS monitor dropped  \n \n          24    to near zero by the time the thiopental and the following  \n \n          25    flush was fully administered, would that cause you to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             245 \n \n \n \n           1    question some of the assumptions you have made and your  \n \n           2    conclusions? \n \n           3    A    No, because I would have to see what the timings of  \n \n           4    those injections were.  It's very possible a slow  \n \n           5    injection, over two minutes, would make perfect sense.  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 101of 116\n \n           6    Q    Have you reviewed, as far as you know, all the expert  \n \n           7    reports that have been generated in this case, both by the  \n \n           8    defense and by the plaintiff? \n \n           9    A    No, I haven't seen Dr. Heath's or Dr. Johnson's. \n \n          10    Q    Have you seen a report of Dr. Sri Melathil? \n \n          11    A    No. \n \n          12    Q    Are you aware that his view was a decline in the level  \n \n          13    of thiopental in the brain is quite rapid and his concern  \n \n          14    was the diminishment of thiopental in the brain instead of  \n \n          15    the onset of the thiopental?  \n \n          16    A    I wasn't aware of that.  I can understand where that  \n \n          17    comes from because that's from clinical teaching and  \n \n          18    clinical doses.  I think, yes, there would be a very rapid  \n \n          19    drop-off.  If you look at my Figure 1, if you would look at  \n \n          20    that, I think you'll see the reason for it.  And -- but  \n \n          21    basically what's going to happen is that concentrations are  \n \n          22    going to flow across a gradient.  And initially during the  \n \n          23    onset, the arterial concentrations are much higher in the  \n \n          24    tissue.  Drugs goes into the tissue including the brain.   \n \n          25    As the drug distributes to various body tissues and is  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             246 \n \n \n \n           1    metabolized, it will start flowing back, and that's what  \n \n           2    removes the effect. \n \n           3              However, if that flow-back starts at a very high  \n \n           4    concentration, you'll still be unconscious even though that  \n \n           5    flow is out of the brain and into the blood. \n \n           6    Q    So huge doses like we're talking about will last -- \n \n           7    A    He's right, but without him doing those calculations  \n \n           8    he's probably a little in the dark. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 102of 116\n \n           9    Q    So the effect of a massive dose, again somewhere  \n \n          10    between 45 seconds to hours? \n \n          11    A    45 minutes to hours. \n \n          12    Q    Execuse me.  45 minutes.  Thank you.  45 minutes to  \n \n          13    hours.  \n \n          14    A    Uh-huh. \n \n          15    Q    You were also referred to a photograph of the femoral  \n \n          16    catheter in Mr. Johnston at his execution.  I don't know if  \n \n          17    you mentioned it in testimony.  In your report you noted  \n \n          18    the brightness of the blood.  Couldn't that be an effect of  \n \n          19    the imaging --  \n \n          20    A    Yes. \n \n          21    Q    -- of the photograph? \n \n          22    A    Could be. \n \n          23    Q    And wouldn't blood, even venous blood, once it hits  \n \n          24    oxygen in the air, become redder than it is inside the  \n \n          25    body? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             247 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It could, but you would see gradations depending on  \n \n           2    its depth in the sponge. \n \n           3    Q    And the bluish area you noted in the photograph of  \n \n           4    Mr. Johnston, couldn't the coloring be also an effect of  \n \n           5    the photograph imaging program that was used? \n \n           6    A    It could be.  I'm not an expert on these things so, I  \n \n           7    mean, in aggregate, as I said, those things suggested to me  \n \n           8    that's what happened. \n \n           9    Q    Your level of certainty, though, it sounded like was  \n \n          10    not very great just from looking at the picture; is that  \n \n          11    correct? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 103of 116\n \n          12    A    I would say it's -- yeah, I would say it's about  \n \n          13    50/50, in my mind, looking at the photograph. \n \n          14    Q    Is it impossible to determine from the photograph  \n \n          15    whether there might have been an insertion into an artery  \n \n          16    in Mr. Johnston's case? \n \n          17    A    That's correct, it is impossible to tell exactly where  \n \n          18    that insertion was made. \n \n          19    Q    You noted a paper with regard to femoral vein access  \n \n          20    that set out a 17 percent complication rate with regard to  \n \n          21    central venous access.  Was it just femoral vein access? \n \n          22    A    It looked at all of them and it categorized the risk  \n \n          23    according to where. \n \n          24    Q    Was the 17 percent complication rate for femoral  \n \n          25    access? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             248 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I believe it was. \n \n           2    Q    Does that complication rate include complications that  \n \n           3    would have resulted from persons new to the procedure and  \n \n           4    inexperienced in the placement of the lines? \n \n           5    A    I would have to go back and check the methods very  \n \n           6    carefully to be sure, but it may have been at a teaching  \n \n           7    hospital and it may have happened that way, yes. \n \n           8    Q    As far as you know, are there any papers reporting  \n \n           9    complication rates with regard to experienced physicians  \n \n          10    who have made femoral IV access a regular part of their  \n \n          11    practice? \n \n          12    A    No, that's not my area of expertise. \n \n          13    Q    You indicated early in your testimony that a problem  \n \n          14    with delivery of thiopental into the body so we get the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 104of 116\n \n          15    full effect of it, one thing could be an impact of  \n \n          16    restraints on the body which is possible with an  \n \n          17    execution.  Would the restraints have an effect if it's  \n \n          18    peripheral access through the arm, assuming straps across  \n \n          19    the torso? \n \n          20    A    It could, yes. \n \n          21    Q    Wouldn't that restraint effect be less with femoral  \n \n          22    access? \n \n          23    A    It might.  Would depend on where the other restraints  \n \n          24    were and how tight they were.  If they were across the  \n \n          25    abdomen it could compress the vena cava. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             249 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Would the effect of a bit of compression on the vena  \n \n           2    cava be less as a percentage of outflow than compression of  \n \n           3    say a peripheral vein? \n \n           4    A    Certainly peripheral veins are easier to compress. \n \n           5    Q    With regard to potential complications and any IV  \n \n           6    access, isn't migration of the catheter a problem; its  \n \n           7    leaving the vein that it's meant to be inserted into? \n \n           8    A    It's a very rare complication. \n \n           9    Q    Isn't it more likely to happen in a peripheral access  \n \n          10    than it is in a femoral central line access? \n \n          11    A    Again, this is not an area of great interest to me and  \n \n          12    I haven't read the literature on that so I can't give you a  \n \n          13    heads-up answer. \n \n          14    Q    You noted a complication in your report being  \n \n          15    potential delivery of the drugs into subcutaneous tissue  \n \n          16    rather than into the vein. \n \n          17    A    Uh-huh. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 105of 116\n \n          18    Q    Isn't that kind of complication less likely to happen  \n \n          19    with femoral access? \n \n          20    A    Well, yes and no.  I have seen many instances where  \n \n          21    because of where the femoral vein is and where the central  \n \n          22    circulation is, you can't always observe extravasation, so \n \n          23    it could be happening but you don't see it.  Certainly with  \n \n          24    a peripheral if it happens, you know it's happening.  You  \n \n          25    can see it.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             250 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    But you're not aware of the differences and the  \n \n           2    likelihood of it happening peripheral vein vs. central  \n \n           3    vein? \n \n           4    A    I can't even imagine someone setting out to study  \n \n           5    that.  That would be a tough question to try to collect  \n \n           6    data on and be fair. \n \n           7    Q    The output of a femoral IV is closer to the heart than  \n \n           8    the peripheral access, isn't it? \n \n           9    A    Would you restate that?  \n \n          10    Q    I'll try.  It wasn't a very good question.  The  \n \n          11    catheter in a femoral IV, where it has the output where the  \n \n          12    drugs come in, isn't that area closer to the heart than  \n \n          13    where the drugs first enter the bloodstream in a peripheral  \n \n          14    IV? \n \n          15    A    The answer to that would be not necessarily, because  \n \n          16    what we're looking at is time.  The flow is less in the  \n \n          17    arm, but the volume is much greater in the vena cava.  So  \n \n          18    the time it takes is the -- is the volume divided by the  \n \n          19    flow.  So both factor in. \n \n          20    Q    And those factors work different ways? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 106of 116\n \n          21    A    We have done many studies where we've given drugs  \n \n          22    peripherally and if it has a good flush behind it, it  \n \n          23    actually can centralize, if you will, the drug. \n \n          24    Q    Doesn't that kind of occur automatically with central  \n \n          25    venous access through the femoral vein? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             251 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes and no.  Not necessarily, because there was no  \n \n           2    baseline infusion going here, so it was totally reliant on  \n \n           3    the syringe.  Whereas if it was given into a free-flowing  \n \n           4    IV, that's not only going to bring it into the circulation  \n \n           5    quick, it's going to push it up the circulation.  So my  \n \n           6    answer is a little equivocal because I'm not a hundred  \n \n           7    percent sure that you can say one way or the other, not  \n \n           8    knowing all the facts. \n \n           9    Q    Do you insert femoral IVs on occasion? \n \n          10    A    Very rarely. \n \n          11    Q    What's your understanding as to the method by which a  \n \n          12    physician would determine where the vein is?  Isn't there  \n \n          13    an anatomical landmark, the femoral artery? \n \n          14    A    There would be the same as we do for internal jugular  \n \n          15    catheterization of the neck.  The old way of doing things  \n \n          16    was to feel the artery and then go adjacent.  In the case  \n \n          17    of the femoral vein, it's just medial.   \n \n          18    Q    It's just medial? \n \n          19    A    Uh-huh. \n \n          20    Q    In other words, it's next to --   \n \n          21    A    Next to. \n \n          22    Q    -- the femoral artery? \n \n          23    A    Right.  So if you had your finger on the femoral  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 107of 116\n \n          24    artery you would reduce your chances of hitting the femoral  \n \n          25    artery and increase your chances of hitting the femoral  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             252 \n \n \n \n           1    vein, although I will say that many places now are moving  \n \n           2    towards ultrasound imaging, so there's a greater degree of  \n \n           3    certainty. \n \n           4    Q    Is that true of -- you said many places.  Is that true  \n \n           5    of every medical facility? \n \n           6    A    No. \n \n           7    Q    And the femoral vein is on the opposite side of the \n \n           8    femoral artery -- excuse me.  The femoral nerve is on the  \n \n           9    opposite side of the femoral artery than the femoral vein  \n \n          10    is? \n \n          11    A    Yes. \n \n          12    Q    Isn't it true that femoral IVs are commonly inserted  \n \n          13    into awake and unsedated patients? \n \n          14    A    In my experience, they are usually sedated. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  Nephrologists, isn't it true they commonly use  \n \n          16    femoral vein IV access for kidney patients who haven't yet  \n \n          17    gotten the shunt or the fistula, whatever it's called, for  \n \n          18    common -- for periodic dialysis?  \n \n          19              MR.

I think it  \n \n          22    goes to the testimony we have had with regard to -- \n \n          23              THE COURT:  Objection is overruled. \n \n          24              MR.

That's all I have at least for the moment.   \n \n          10              And thank you for allowing me to use your high  \n \n          11    tech equipment. \n \n          12              MR. HELLMAN:  Sure thing.   \n \n          13    REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BERGER:  \n \n          14    Q    I have a few questions for you, Dr. Henthorn. \n \n          15              Are all of your graphs based on the assumptions  \n \n          16    that the full dose of the amount considered will make it  \n \n          17    into the venous system? \n \n          18    A    Yes, they are. \n \n          19    Q    So if some of the prepared dose did not make it into  \n \n          20    the veins, would the graph conclusions hold true? \n \n          21    A    No. \n \n          22              MR. PRITCHETT:  Objection.  I think this is  \n \n          23    beyond the scope of the direct and cross. \n \n          24              THE COURT:  Well, I don't think it's outside the  \n \n          25    spirit of either.  Objection is overruled. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             254 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  And if in fact less than the prepared  \n \n           2    dose made it into the veins, what effect would that have on  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 109of 116\n \n           3    when the thiopental takes effect? \n \n           4    A    Well, it would depend on the percentage.  If you  \n \n           5    consider a reasonably close percentage, or -- of the dose,  \n \n           6    then it would only slow it down.  If it was much smaller,  \n \n           7    you might not get the effect you're looking for. \n \n           8    Q    And are all the opinions you are giving here given to  \n \n           9    a reasonable degree of medical certainty? \n \n          10    A    Yes. \n \n          11    Q    Why is burst suppression appropriate for executions  \n \n          12    even when it's not always used for surgery? \n \n          13    A    The reason is that since there is no one monitoring  \n \n          14    the onset of anesthesia, there is the possibility that when  \n \n          15    something painful happens, such as injecting potassium  \n \n          16    chloride, that there will be movement, there could be a  \n \n          17    reaction.  And I think it's very important to be able to  \n \n          18    say that this reaction did not involve consciousness.  It  \n \n          19    could be simply a reflex lower in the system. \n \n          20    Q    In surgery are you also concerned with the patient  \n \n          21    waking up? \n \n          22    A    Yes. \n \n          23    Q    If you were not -- if you were concerned only about  \n \n          24    pain and not about waking a patient up during surgery,  \n \n          25    would burst suppression be the level of anesthesia one  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             255 \n \n \n \n           1    would want to use?  In other words, in the execution  \n \n           2    setting, do those factors render burst suppression more  \n \n           3    appropriate? \n \n           4    A    Well, I think the process is very similar.  I think  \n \n           5    the difference is there is no one monitoring to say whether  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 110of 116\n \n           6    or not this is conscious or not conscious.  If there is  \n \n           7    burst suppression, there's no consciousness.   \n \n           8    Q    And without monitoring the depth of anesthesia, can  \n \n           9    you be certain that the inmate will be properly  \n \n          10    anesthetized? \n \n          11    A    I don't believe so, no. \n \n          12    Q    Is there such a thing as certainty that drugs are  \n \n          13    delivered successfully? \n \n          14    A    I don't -- I don't believe so, no. \n \n          15    Q    And is this lack of certainty one of the reasons why  \n \n          16    one needs to monitor the delivery of the drugs and the  \n \n          17    depth of anesthesia? \n \n          18    A    Oh, absolutely.  If you look at the ASA -- that's our  \n \n          19    society's recent guidelines on awareness, the first thing  \n \n          20    to consider is are the drugs being delivered the way you  \n \n          21    think they are, are your infusions working.  Is the gas on,  \n \n          22    if you want -- if you're using that.  So I think that is  \n \n          23    always on our mind, because it does happen. \n \n          24    Q    Can you properly judge anesthetic depth based on the  \n \n          25    view that you saw through the window in those figures? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             256 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    When Mr. Pritchett was examining you, you said that  \n \n           3    the aspect is a step in monitoring anesthetic depth.  Is  \n \n           4    that step enough to monitor anesthetic depth? \n \n           5    A    No, it's not. \n \n           6    Q    In discussing his graphs, Dr. Dershwitz stated, quote,  \n \n           7    \"So in a typical experiment where one is giving medication  \n \n           8    to try to determine if a person is conscious, the person  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 111of 116\n \n           9    would be asked to perform a simple task.  If they cannot  \n \n          10    perform the task, they are deemed as unconscious.\"  What  \n \n          11    does that tell you about the measure of consciousness used  \n \n          12    by Dr. Dershwitz in his graphs? \n \n          13    A    Well, it indicates that is the end point that he was  \n \n          14    modeling was loss of the voice command. \n \n          15    Q    Can one feel pain at that level? \n \n          16    A    Yes. \n \n          17    Q    Then in the transcript Dr. Dershwitz says, \"When one  \n \n          18    considers the very, very large dose and the long duration  \n \n          19    of the effects that occurs when one is given five grams of  \n \n          20    thiopental, the effect is complete, total inability to  \n \n          21    interact with the environment or perceive one's environment  \n \n          22    for a very long time.\"   \n \n          23              Assuming successful delivery into the  \n \n          24    circulation, Dr. Henthorn, do you agree? \n \n          25    A    Well, to a certain point he's absolutely right.  I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             257 \n \n \n \n           1    think the point that we -- what's really disturbing here  \n \n           2    is the onset time.  That seems to be just overlooked  \n \n           3    completely in these Missouri executions.  The timing is so  \n \n           4    rapid that there's no time for that to happen.  But if you  \n \n           5    give it enough time, then I would say Dr. Dershwitz'  \n \n           6    conclusions are correct. \n \n           7    Q    But at the level of consciousness used by  \n \n           8    Dr. Dershwitz, that is inability to correctly respond to  \n \n           9    verbal commands, can people feel pain? \n \n          10    A    Yes, but you have to -- he was -- he selected -- he's  \n \n          11    doing simply the very thing -- something very similar to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 112of 116\n \n          12    what I'm doing, which is simulating the pharmacokinetics,  \n \n          13    and he's selecting a blood level that is less than the one  \n \n          14    I'm selecting.  But in either case with a five-gram dose  \n \n          15    both brain levels are achieved. \n \n          16    Q    But they would not be -- would they be achieved  \n \n          17    immediately? \n \n          18    A    No. \n \n          19    Q    And would the level that he is selecting take effect  \n \n          20    quicker than the level you are selecting? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    And if the level he has selected has taken effect but  \n \n          23    the level that you have selected has not yet taken effect,  \n \n          24    can a person experience pain? \n \n          25    A    Absolutely. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             258 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Why do you -- \n \n           2              THE COURT:  Mr. Berger, it sounds like we are  \n \n           3    getting back into redirect again.  Let's stick with the  \n \n           4    cross and wrap this up. \n \n           5              MR. BERGER:  Okay, Your Honor. \n \n           6    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Why do you select 50 to 75 percent as  \n \n           7    the most likely reduction in cardiac output? \n \n           8    A    Because this fits with anything in the literature.   \n \n           9    It also fits with what I have observed when I have had  \n \n          10    continuous monitors of cardiac output.  And in fact,  \n \n          11    Dr. Dershwitz basically believes the exact same thing. \n \n          12    Q    And in your clinical practice, do smaller doses of  \n \n          13    thiopental also have an effect on cardiac output? \n \n          14    A    Yes, they do. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 113of 116\n \n          15    Q    Have you tested the extrapolations you make on the  \n \n          16    scientific community, the extrapolations you make in your  \n \n          17    model that Mr. Pritchett questioned you about? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    And have you revised your conclusions over the years  \n \n          20    as you understand it better? \n \n          21    A    Oh, absolutely, yes. \n \n          22    Q    Dr. Henthorn, Mr. Pritchett asked you about the BIS  \n \n          23    monitor.  Is the BIS monitor a reliable indicator of deep  \n \n          24    unconsciousness? \n \n          25    A    It is not -- the literature does not support that it  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             259 \n \n \n \n           1    is reliable. \n \n           2    Q    What are some of the problems of the BIS monitor? \n \n           3    A    It does not predict what it is meant to predict, which  \n \n           4    is awareness.  It's -- it's useful.  Some people believe  \n \n           5    it's useful, but it's not an absolute measure, and for that  \n \n           6    reason it was not included in the recent ASA guidelines  \n \n           7    awareness. \n \n           8    Q    Dr. Henthorn, is it possible for an anesthesiologist  \n \n           9    or a pharmacokineticist who has not done the calculations  \n \n          10    or the modeling that you have done to know when thiopental  \n \n          11    will take effect? \n \n          12    A    Well, they can rely on their empirical knowledge, but  \n \n          13    I think when you're dealing with dose -- that's one of the  \n \n          14    reasons you do pharmacokinetics is so that when you are  \n \n          15    presented with a dose or a drug administration scheme that  \n \n          16    you haven't performed, you can reasonably come up with what  \n \n          17    will happen.  It's predictive. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 114of 116\n \n          18    Q    Dr. Henthorn, Mr. Pritchett asked you some questions  \n \n          19    about the photo of Mr. Johnston.  Was your view that this  \n \n          20    is a hematoma based just on the color of the blood? \n \n          21    A    No. \n \n          22    Q    Was it based on a number of factors? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    What were those factors? \n \n          25    A    It was the proximity -- it was the blue discoloration  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             260 \n \n \n \n           1    under the skin.

BERGER:  One moment, Your Honor.   \n \n          14              No further questions, Your Honor. \n \n          15              MR. PRITCHETT:  I think one, Judge.   \n \n          16    RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PRITCHETT: \n \n          17    Q    We have talked about voice command level of  \n \n          18    unconsciousness and burst suppression level of  \n \n          19    unconsciousness.  Is there some level of unconsciousness in  \n \n          20    between those two poles, let's call them, where the person  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 115of 116\n \n          21    who is receiving the thiopental will not feel pain? \n \n          22    A    Probably there would be, but it's a gray area.  You  \n \n          23    don't know unless there's someone there monitoring.  That's  \n \n          24    my point. \n \n          25              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             261 \n \n \n \n           1              MR.

BERGER: \n \n           5    Q    Dr. Henthorn, if a patient or an inmate is not at  \n \n           6    burst suppression, is it possible for them to feel pain? \n \n           7    A    Yes. \n \n           8              MR. BERGER:  Thank you. \n \n           9              MR. PRITCHETT:  Nothing further, Judge. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  We have heard that one a couple  \n \n          11    times.   \n \n          12              Thank you, Doctor.  You can step down. \n \n          13              THE WITNESS:  Thank you. \n \n          14              THE COURT:  It's my understanding that other than  \n \n          15    the Doe witnesses, this is plaintiff's case.  Is that  \n \n          16    correct? \n \n          17              MR. HELLMAN:  Those are our witnesses who are  \n \n          18    present, Your Honor. \n \n          19              THE COURT:  All right.  Then we'll resume  \n \n          20    tomorrow at 9 o'clock and the defense will have an  \n \n          21    opportunity to have its witnesses present and ready to go.   \n \n          22    Okay? \n \n          23              MR.

Have you had the opportunity to  \n \n          10    review that additional discovery that's been provided by  \n \n          11    both sides in this case? \n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    And did this review include the post-remand discovery  \n \n          14    responses of both Director Crawford as well as the John  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 5of 124\n \n          15    Does? \n \n          16    A    Yes. \n \n          17    Q    And did it also include a review of the deposition of  \n \n          18    Dr. John Doe One? \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    So are you aware that the dose of thiopental used at  \n \n          21    the last several executions in Missouri was not five grams  \n \n          22    as we understood in January? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    How, if at all -- excuse me.  What is your  \n \n          25    understanding of the amount of thiopental that was actually  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             264 \n \n \n \n           1    given at the last several executions? \n \n           2    A    I believe it was 2.5 grams. \n \n           3    Q    How, if at all, does the administration of 2.5 grams  \n \n           4    of thiopental the last few executions impact your opinions  \n \n           5    regarding executions in Missouri? \n \n           6    A    By decreasing the dose from five grams to 2.5 grams,  \n \n           7    the probability of consciousness increases by a tiny and  \n \n           8    minuscule amount.  Other states use as little as two grams  \n \n           9    of thiopental, and even in that situation the likelihood of  \n \n          10    consciousness during the period of time that an execution  \n \n          11    requires is a tiny fraction of one percent. \n \n          12    Q    What's the key factor, in your opinion, regarding the  \n \n          13    humaneness of executions in Missouri in particular and then  \n \n          14    throughout the country in general? \n \n          15    A    Well, in my opinion for an execution to be humane an  \n \n          16    adequate dose of hypnotic agent like thiopental has to be  \n \n          17    administered prior to the paralytic or the potassium  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 6of 124\n \n          18    chloride.  And in the other states in which I have  \n \n          19    performed calculations I would say that probably the  \n \n          20    minimum acceptable dose would be 1.5 grams, and anything  \n \n          21    above that is associated with diminishing likelihood of  \n \n          22    consciousness. \n \n          23    Q    Did your review of the new discovery in this case  \n \n          24    alter your opinions that you gave back in January with  \n \n          25    regard to the drugs used in Missouri and the dosages as  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             265 \n \n \n \n           1    we now understand them? \n \n           2    A    Well, I redid the calculations, and changing the  \n \n           3    dose from five grams to 2.5 grams has a minuscule and not  \n \n           4    clinically relevant effect on the probability of  \n \n           5    consciousness throughout the duration of time that an  \n \n           6    execution requires. \n \n           7    Q    Did your review of the new discovery in the case alter  \n \n           8    your opinions as given back in January with regard to the  \n \n           9    use of the femoral catheter as a means of administration of  \n \n          10    the drugs? \n \n          11    A    No. \n \n          12    Q    Can you explain why? \n \n          13    A    Well, since the thiopental is given after the femoral  \n \n          14    catheter is placed, the dose of thiopental itself has no  \n \n          15    meaningful effect on the placement of the femoral catheter. \n \n          16    Q    In reaching your conclusions as expressed in your  \n \n          17    earlier testimony, what definition of unconsciousness were  \n \n          18    you using? \n \n          19    A    The definition of consciousness that I typically use  \n \n          20    is that which is used as a standard in the field of  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 7of 124\n \n          21    anesthesiology when looking at the time course of the  \n \n          22    production of unconsciousness during a clinical anesthesia,  \n \n          23    and the end point is whether or not the person is capable  \n \n          24    of consciously processing a verbal command.  And so,  \n \n          25    therefore, if the person is told raise your right arm or  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             266 \n \n \n \n           1    raise your left leg, if they follow that command  \n \n           2    appropriately they are deemed conscious.  If they are  \n \n           3    unable to follow that command, and the assumption is that  \n \n           4    they are motivated to -- would be motivated to follow the  \n \n           5    command if they could, if they could not follow that  \n \n           6    command they would be deemed unconscious. \n \n           7    Q    Why do you use this definition of consciousness vs.  \n \n           8    unconsciousness, ability to respond accurately to verbal  \n \n           9    commands? \n \n          10    A    It is the most common end point used in research on  \n \n          11    consciousness and unconsciousness in anesthesia.  And, for  \n \n          12    example, it is the end point that was used in the  \n \n          13    development of the depth of anesthesia monitors that are  \n \n          14    becoming more commonly used in anesthesia practice. \n \n          15    Q    We'll get to that in a bit, but what's the name of the  \n \n          16    monitor you're referring to? \n \n          17    A    One of them is called the bispectral index monitor or  \n \n          18    BIS monitor, but there are a number of other monitors made  \n \n          19    by other companies also. \n \n          20    Q    Because you use a definition of consciousness vs.  \n \n          21    unconsciousness that concluded a person who can -- let me  \n \n          22    back up and rephrase that.   \n \n          23              When you used the BIS definition of consciousness  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 8of 124\n \n          24    vs. unconsciousness, does that mean that you concluded that  \n \n          25    the person who has received thiopental remains at that  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             267 \n \n \n \n           1    level of consciousness? \n \n           2    A    No.  That is the point at which they would lose  \n \n           3    consciousness.  And of course, consciousness can become  \n \n           4    much deeper and have other end points, but that is a  \n \n           5    readily measured end point.  And for the purposes of  \n \n           6    providing clinical anesthesia, it's a very clinically  \n \n           7    meaningful end point, because in our practice we want to  \n \n           8    make sure that the person is asleep, unable to process  \n \n           9    information, which would mean in a clinical way they would  \n \n          10    be unable to form a memory, which of course we would  \n \n          11    consider to be very desirable.  The inability to form a  \n \n          12    memory would be very desirable in anesthesia. \n \n          13    Q    So given a dose of thiopental at the level of 2.5, or  \n \n          14    five grams if it makes a difference both ways, how quickly  \n \n          15    is a person moving from the level of unconsciousness,  \n \n          16    unable to respond accurately to voice commands, how quickly  \n \n          17    does a person move from that stage to a deeper level of  \n \n          18    unconsciousness? \n \n          19    A    It actually happens very rapidly.  The amount of  \n \n          20    thiopental that it takes the average person to lose  \n \n          21    consciousness is approximately 200 to 300 milligrams.  And  \n \n          22    once 200 to 300 milligrams are placed intravenously in the  \n \n          23    body, loss of consciousness occurs typically in a matter of  \n \n          24    20 to 30 seconds.  As the dose is increased, the depth of  \n \n          25    consciousness as well as the duration of unconsciousness  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             268 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 9of 124\n \n \n \n           1    continues to progress. \n \n           2    Q    You said that at a level of two to 300 milligrams  \n \n           3    of thiopental, it takes about I believe you said around  \n \n           4    30 seconds? \n \n           5    A    20 to 30 seconds from the time 200 to 300 milligrams  \n \n           6    reach the peripheral circulation through an intravenous  \n \n           7    catheter. \n \n           8    Q    How is it you are aware of that conclusion? \n \n           9    A    Well, first of all, that is based on more than twenty  \n \n          10    years of clinical experience of myself, as well as the  \n \n          11    experience of many, many anesthesiologists, as well as  \n \n          12    clinical studies that have been done using many different  \n \n          13    measures of the depth of consciousness.  Before we had  \n \n          14    readily available EEG monitors, one of the ways that  \n \n          15    patients were deemed to be unconscious is they would be  \n \n          16    given, for instance, a syringe or a pencil to hold and told  \n \n          17    hold on to this as long as you can, and when they dropped  \n \n          18    it they were deemed to be unconscious.  That was a  \n \n          19    technique that was used, for instance, in the 1960s and  \n \n          20    1970s. \n \n          21              And using that end point, and also using a  \n \n          22    typical dose of the hypnotic agent, consciousness is lost  \n \n          23    typically in 20 to 30 seconds from the time the drug  \n \n          24    reaches the IV catheter. \n \n          25    Q    Is there a fairly common medical practice that also  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             269 \n \n \n \n           1    confirms your view, from a practical point of view, that  \n \n           2    loss of consciousness occurs in 20 to 30 seconds? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 10of 124\n \n           3    A    Typically if we are inducing general anesthesia,  \n \n           4    typically we wish to confirm that the patient is asleep  \n \n           5    before giving, for instance, a paralytic drug or performing  \n \n           6    a noxious stimulation, and clinically we may apply  \n \n           7    observational techniques like speaking the person's name  \n \n           8    and asking them to open their eyes for instance, or giving  \n \n           9    them a command like take a deep breath.  We are often  \n \n          10    telling them to breathe deeply before they fall asleep, and \n \n          11    when they stop doing that volitionally, that's another way.   \n \n          12    And then we can look for reflexes, like we take our finger  \n \n          13    and gently stroke their eyelash and see if they still have  \n \n          14    what we call a lid reflex and that's a normal response that  \n \n          15    a person has to blink when their eyelash is stroked. \n \n          16    Q    Is there a practice, though, in which general  \n \n          17    anesthesia is induced and it's induced very quickly and  \n \n          18    there is essentially no monitoring of the anesthetic depth? \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    What is that?   \n \n          21    A    That's called a rapid sequence induction, and in a  \n \n          22    situation where we are concerned about the risk of  \n \n          23    aspiration, which would mean passage of the abdominal  \n \n          24    contents back into the throat and then going down the  \n \n          25    trachea into the lung, certain patients are at higher risk  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             270 \n \n \n \n           1    for this passive regurgitation and aspiration.  Those  \n \n           2    patients include patients who are having anesthesia who  \n \n           3    have not been properly fasted; patients who have certain  \n \n           4    anatomic abnormalities like a hiatal hernia; patients who  \n \n           5    have a history of esophageal reflux; patients who have  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 11of 124\n \n           6    increased intra-abdominal pressure perhaps due to a tumor,  \n \n           7    all of these people are at high risk for aspiration. \n \n           8              And during the period of time after they lose  \n \n           9    consciousness and before we secure their airway with an  \n \n          10    endotracheal tube, that is a period of time of great  \n \n          11    vulnerability for aspiration to occur.  So in order to  \n \n          12    decrease this window of opportunity for aspiration to  \n \n          13    occur, we perform what's called a rapid sequence induction. \n \n          14              And in that scenario we give the hypnotic agent,  \n \n          15    like thiopental, followed by a paralytic agent immediately,  \n \n          16    without assessing depth of anesthesia, followed by the --   \n \n          17    a passage of about 30 seconds which is how long it takes  \n \n          18    the paralytic agent in this case to work, and then the  \n \n          19    insertion of the laryngoscope to visualize the airway and  \n \n          20    then placement of the endotracheal tube. \n \n          21              So in the situation of a rapid sequence  \n \n          22    induction, from the time we first begin administering the  \n \n          23    hypnotic agent -- \n \n          24    Q    And what dose is typically used in the rapid sequence  \n \n          25    induction of the hypnotic agent? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             271 \n \n \n \n           1    A    If we were using thiopental as a hypnotic agent, a  \n \n           2    typical dose would be 300 to 400 milligrams, and it would  \n \n           3    take an average ten seconds to administer the thiopental,  \n \n           4    five seconds to administer the paralytic agent, or less.   \n \n           5    Waiting 20 to 30 seconds for the paralytic agent to begin,   \n \n           6    and since this particular paralytic agent causes widespread  \n \n           7    muscle twitching, we know when the paralytic agent is \n \n           8    working because it's very easily seen visually.  At that  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 12of 124\n \n           9    point, we immediately put in the laryngoscope to visualize  \n \n          10    the airway and put the endotracheal tube in. \n \n          11              So in this scenario we are instrumenting the  \n \n          12    airway, which is very, very uncomfortable, well under a  \n \n          13    minute after the thiopental administration was first  \n \n          14    given.  And based upon, you know, my extensive clinical  \n \n          15    experience as well as the clinical experience of  \n \n          16    essentially everybody who gives anesthesia, the likelihood  \n \n          17    of awareness during this procedure is very, very small. \n \n          18    Q    And we're talking about a time period between the  \n \n          19    administration of the thiopental to the introduction of the  \n \n          20    laryngoscope, how long between those two end points? \n \n          21    A    Under a minute.  Probably closer to 45 seconds. \n \n          22    Q    And is there essentially any kind of monitoring of the  \n \n          23    patient during the course of that time? \n \n          24    A    Well, we would of course continue to monitor their  \n \n          25    electrocardiogram and their heart rate and their oxygen  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             272 \n \n \n \n           1    level because those are standard things that we monitor in  \n \n           2    everybody.  But as far as any attempt to monitor the depth  \n \n           3    of anesthesia in a rapid sequence induction, that is not  \n \n           4    done.  And the assumption is made that the initial dose of  \n \n           5    the hypnotic agent, like thiopental, is adequate to achieve  \n \n           6    unconsciousness for the duration of the placement of the  \n \n           7    endotracheal tube. \n \n           8    Q    And I think this should be obvious, but that  \n \n           9    assumption is one that has been confirmed at least in  \n \n          10    your experience and the experience of your colleagues? \n \n          11    A    Yes.  It is certainly the standard description of how  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 13of 124\n \n          12    to perform a rapid sequence induction in our standard  \n \n          13    textbooks. \n \n          14    Q    Is the rapid sequence induction an uncommon procedure? \n \n          15    A    No, not at all.  It would be the standard way of  \n \n          16    providing anesthesia for essentially everybody who is  \n \n          17    having emergency or unscheduled surgery because most of  \n \n          18    those patients are not properly fasted, and people who  \n \n          19    complain of things like a hiatal hernia or gastro-  \n \n          20    esophageal reflux, that represents a significant fraction  \n \n          21    of the population.  So people who undergo rapid sequence  \n \n          22    induction, it's not the majority of anesthetics but it's a  \n \n          23    significant minority.        \n \n          24    Q    Would you say it's a process that happens every day in  \n \n          25    hospitals? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             273 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, every day in essentially every hospital in which  \n \n           2    endotracheal anesthesia is provided. \n \n           3    Q    What's your understanding, from your review of the  \n \n           4    documents in this case, as to the level of consciousness,  \n \n           5    unconsciousness that was used by Dr. Henthorn in reaching  \n \n           6    his conclusions about when the second and the third drug  \n \n           7    should be administered in an execution circumstance? \n \n           8    A    My understanding is that he used an EEG end point that  \n \n           9    he called burst suppression.  And in further reviewing his  \n \n          10    written materials, I believe he was using a definition of  \n \n          11    burst suppression that was equivalent to a suppression  \n \n          12    ratio of 50 percent, meaning that 50 percent of the time  \n \n          13    the EEG had flat line and 50 percent of the time the EEG  \n \n          14    had typical waves. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 14of 124\n \n          15    Q    In your medical judgment, is that the proper level to  \n \n          16    be thinking we need to get to, that is needed to get to in  \n \n          17    an execution circumstance when we get to the second and the  \n \n          18    third drug? \n \n          19    A    Well, this level of anesthesia in which we have what's  \n \n          20    called a suppression ratio of 50 percent is far in excess  \n \n          21    of what is needed in clinical anesthesia.  Now, certainly  \n \n          22    with the doses of thiopental that are employed in a lethal  \n \n          23    injection, ultimately not only are you going to reach burst  \n \n          24    suppression, you're going to reach a complete flat line, a  \n \n          25    completely isoelectric EEG. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             274 \n \n \n \n           1              But at the point in time in which you can  \n \n           2    reliably perform something uncomfortable and be convinced  \n \n           3    that the person is not going to experience any pain or  \n \n           4    suffering will occur much earlier, because one does not  \n \n           5    need to go to an end point of burst suppression to prevent  \n \n           6    the perception of noxious stimuli.  And, in fact, when we  \n \n           7    do clinical anesthesia for surgery, if we were monitoring  \n \n           8    the patient with an EEG, which is something that, for  \n \n           9    instance, I regularly do, the end point of burst  \n \n          10    suppression is an unnecessarily deep level of anesthesia.   \n \n          11    It's not harmful to the patient, but it is associated with  \n \n          12    a prolonged wake-up at the end of the case.  In other  \n \n          13    words, it means that I'm not providing an efficient  \n \n          14    anesthetic. \n \n          15               So a level of unconsciousness that is higher  \n \n          16    than the point at which one reaches burst suppression is  \n \n          17    still consistent with adequate surgical anesthesia and  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 15of 124\n \n          18    would be certainly associated with the inability to  \n \n          19    perceive any noxious stimulus, as for example during a  \n \n          20    judicial execution. \n \n          21    Q    Is the level of unconsciousness, burst suppression  \n \n          22    as used by Dr. Henthorn, a much deeper level of  \n \n          23    unconsciousness than that that's targeted in surgery? \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    You mentioned the bispectral index and the S is for  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             275 \n \n \n \n           1    the -- the BIS monitor, what does BIS stand for? \n \n           2    A    Well, BIS is a shortened term for bispectral. \n \n           3    Q    Okay.  The bispectral index monitor.  What is this  \n \n           4    monitor built to measure?  \n \n           5    A    This is a monitor that is designed to facilitate using  \n \n           6    EEG monitoring by anesthesiologists who are typically not  \n \n           7    well-trained in the interpretation of complex EEG waves.   \n \n           8    So the monitor consists of applying electrodes to the  \n \n           9    forehead that acquire EEG waves from the brain.  The EEG  \n \n          10    signal is then processed by a computer, and although the  \n \n          11    EEG waves are displayed on the screen, a person who is not  \n \n          12    well-versed in their interpretation does not need to rely  \n \n          13    on their appearance or pattern to use the monitor. \n \n          14              The monitor then displays a number between zero  \n \n          15    and a hundred which is used to correlate with the  \n \n          16    probability of unconsciousness.  And the relationship  \n \n          17    between the actual BIS value and the probability of  \n \n          18    unconsciousness is a complex curve.  It's called a sigmoid  \n \n          19    curve.  But clinically, anesthesiologists know that if they  \n \n          20    target the anesthetic depth to a BIS value of between 40  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 16of 124\n \n          21    and 60 they know, based upon a huge body of clinical data,  \n \n          22    that the probability of consciousness during the surgery is  \n \n          23    minuscule. \n \n          24    Q    So for surgery the BIS monitor is targeted at 40 to  \n \n          25    60? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             276 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Correct. \n \n           2    Q    Burst suppression as used by Dr. Henthorn, what level  \n \n           3    is that?  What number on the scale, approximately, would  \n \n           4    that be? \n \n           5    A    Well, first of all, the appearance of any burst  \n \n           6    suppression occurs as a BIS value of 40.  And a 50 percent  \n \n           7    suppression ratio, which as I described is what I believe  \n \n           8    the end point he was using where we have a 50 percent flat  \n \n           9    line, 50 percent EEG waves, that corresponds to a BIS value  \n \n          10    of approximately 15 to 20, approximately. \n \n          11    Q    I'd like to show you what's been labeled Defendant's  \n \n          12    Exhibit 2 and I have already provided -- let me hand this  \n \n          13    to you.   \n \n          14              MR. PRITCHETT:  And, Judge, I could give you a  \n \n          15    copy if you would like to follow along. \n \n          16              THE COURT:  Yes, if you would.   \n \n          17              Thank you. \n \n          18    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  What is Exhibit 2, Defendant's  \n \n          19    Exhibit 2? \n \n          20    A    This is actually an exhibit from one of the papers  \n \n          21    that I have published.  I was a participant in one of the  \n \n          22    early studies in which the algorithm underlying the BIS  \n \n          23    monitor was developed, and this is some data from that  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 17of 124\n \n          24    paper.  And so on the X axis, we have the BIS value and on  \n \n          25    the Y axis we have probability of response. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             277 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Before you go any further, you prepared this document? \n \n           2    A    Yes.  This is from a paper in which I am the coauthor. \n \n           3    Q    And you have described what it is. \n \n           4              MR. PRITCHETT:  I'd offer Defendant's Exhibit 2  \n \n           5    in evidence for illustrative purposes. \n \n           6              MS. ANDERS:  No objection. \n \n           7              THE COURT:  Be received. \n \n           8              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you. \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  Now, if you could explain for us  \n \n          10    the meaning of the chart, and particularly I think it would  \n \n          11    be helpful to talk about the relationship between the  \n \n          12    probability of response vs. the BIS number read-out. \n \n          13    A    So on the X axis we have the BIS value and on the  \n \n          14    Y axis we have the probability of response, which in this  \n \n          15    case again was properly and accurately following the  \n \n          16    command like raise your right arm, raise your left leg.   \n \n          17    And as you can see, the curve is shaped in a sigmoid in  \n \n          18    which as the BIS value proceeds from 40 through the mid  \n \n          19    50s, essentially the probability of response or the  \n \n          20    probability of consciousness is very tiny.   \n \n          21              And then after a point in the mid to high 50s,  \n \n          22    the curve takes a rapid upturn, and by the time the BIS  \n \n          23    value is in the high 70s, almost everybody is conscious.   \n \n          24              Now, in the same experiment we also determined  \n \n          25    whether or not the patient would have recall.  And the way  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             278 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 18of 124\n \n \n \n           1    that was determined, immediately following giving the  \n \n           2    patient the command to raise your right arm, raise your  \n \n           3    left leg, they were also told something like John, I want  \n \n           4    you to remember the word table.  John, the word table is  \n \n           5    very important.  Please remember it.  And then after the  \n \n           6    experiment was over, they were asked to recall the words  \n \n           7    that they were told. \n \n           8              And as you can see, there's a separate curve  \n \n           9    which plots the probability of recall vs. the BIS value.   \n \n          10    And these two curves are separated by approximately 15 to  \n \n          11    20 BIS points on the X axis.  The reason that clinicians  \n \n          12    have chosen to target a BIS of 40 to 60 for clinical  \n \n          13    anesthesia is that even though 15 -- approximately 15  \n \n          14    percent of the population may have some degree of  \n \n          15    consciousness at a BIS of 60, the probability of recall is  \n \n          16    still extremely low.  And it is thought that awareness  \n \n          17    under anesthesia and the absence of recall is probably not  \n \n          18    harmful.   \n \n          19              The reason that a BIS value of 40 is chosen as  \n \n          20    the lower limit in clinical anesthesia is because anything  \n \n          21    below that is thought to be unnecessarily deep and is  \n \n          22    thought to be associated with a prolonged awakening at the  \n \n          23    end of the case.   \n \n          24    Q    Thank you for the description, Doctor.   \n \n          25              In your medical judgment, does a BIS monitor  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             279 \n \n \n \n           1    reliably measure the depth of consciousness? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 19of 124\n \n           3    Q    And why do you say that? \n \n           4    A    Well, it's borne out by a number of clinical trials  \n \n           5    that have been published so far on thousands of patients.   \n \n           6    Like any clinical test, it is not perfect.  There are  \n \n           7    certain people in whom it may not work well, especially  \n \n           8    those with underlying abnormalities in their EEGs, but in  \n \n           9    the vast majority of people it is a reliable clinical  \n \n          10    monitor and has made our ability to deliver anesthesia  \n \n          11    better and safer. \n \n          12    Q    Are you aware of the use of a BIS monitor in a recent  \n \n          13    execution in North Carolina? \n \n          14    A    Yes, I am. \n \n          15    Q    And what is your understanding of the read-out, the  \n \n          16    impact of the use of thiopental as measured by the BIS  \n \n          17    monitor at that execution? \n \n          18    A    In the protocol that North Carolina applied, the  \n \n          19    execution team placed a BIS monitor on the patient or on  \n \n          20    the inmate before the beginning of the injection sequence.   \n \n          21    And the protocol has built into it a pause at the  \n \n          22    conclusion of the administration of the flush solution \n \n          23    following thiopental.  And at this point in the protocol  \n \n          24    the physician and nurse who were monitoring the BIS monitor  \n \n          25    would then give the go-ahead to the execution team to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             280 \n \n \n \n           1    proceed with the administration of pancuronium and then  \n \n           2    potassium chloride.  And the protocol mandated that the BIS  \n \n           3    value was to be below 60 prior to the administration of the  \n \n           4    second and third drugs.  And the physician and nurse who  \n \n           5    were monitoring the BIS monitor had the authority to order  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 20of 124\n \n           6    additional thiopental had the person not reached a BIS  \n \n           7    value of 60 in a reasonable amount of time.   \n \n           8              In fact, in that execution there was no pause  \n \n           9    that was required because by the time the flush solution  \n \n          10    had completed being injected, the BIS value was zero and  \n \n          11    the EEG was flat line.  So this is the lowest measurable  \n \n          12    level of consciousness that one can achieve medically  \n \n          13    because one cannot measure any depth of consciousness below  \n \n          14    the complete cessation of electrical activity in the brain. \n \n          15    Q    What's the dose of thiopental that was used in  \n \n          16    North Carolina on this occasion? \n \n          17    A    Three grams. \n \n          18    Q    How long did it take the BIS monitor to drop to zero  \n \n          19    after the beginning of the administration of the  \n \n          20    thiopental? \n \n          21    A    Well, the BIS value dropped continuously after the  \n \n          22    thiopental started going in.  It took approximately between  \n \n          23    a minute and a minute and a half to complete the entire  \n \n          24    injection sequence of the thiopental and the flush  \n \n          25    solution.  And prior to the completion of the flush  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             281 \n \n \n \n           1    solution, the BIS value had already reached zero and the  \n \n           2    electrical activity of the brain was already flat line. \n \n           3    Q    Is that actual experience in North Carolina  \n \n           4    consistent with Dr. Henthorn's conclusions regarding the  \n \n           5    time needed for thiopental to result in burst suppression? \n \n           6    A    I think that his predictions are resulting in an  \n \n           7    unnecessarily long time to the point at which burst  \n \n           8    suppression will occur. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 21of 124\n \n           9    Q    And that's supported in part by the North Carolina  \n \n          10    example? \n \n          11    A    It's supported by the North Carolina example, and as I  \n \n          12    said, it's also supported by many, many years of clinical  \n \n          13    experience among many anesthesiologists who do rapid  \n \n          14    sequence induction without having their patients awake or  \n \n          15    have recall during the placement of the endotracheal tube. \n \n          16    Q    You have had a chance to examine Dr. Henthorn's  \n \n          17    modeling, I think? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    And have you determined that there is a mistake or an  \n \n          20    incorrect assumption in the analysis? \n \n          21    A    I'm not sure I would phrase it as a mistake, but there  \n \n          22    is an assumption with which I do not agree.   \n \n          23    Q    What is that assumption? \n \n          24    A    Can we look at that figure so I could have it in front  \n \n          25    of me? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             282 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Yes.   \n \n           2              MR. PRITCHETT:  What the doctor is asking for is  \n \n           3    what I think was Plaintiff's Exhibit 43.  43, Figure 4. \n \n           4              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, we object on the grounds  \n \n           5    that this wasn't covered in Dr. Dershwitz' expert report. \n \n           6              MR. PRITCHETT:  I think the doctor did indicate  \n \n           7    that he had looked at Dr. Henthorn's report and considered  \n \n           8    that it did not accurately reflect what would occur. \n \n           9              MR. BERGER:  Your Honor, Dr. Dershwitz' report  \n \n          10    didn't give any bases for what that -- you know, what that  \n \n          11    would be.  It said with no detail at all what his attack  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 22of 124\n \n          12    would be on these models.   \n \n          13              MR. PRITCHETT:  It says the doctor's assumptions  \n \n          14    are based -- the predictions are unscientifically sound and  \n \n          15    are based upon assumptions that result in an over-lengthy  \n \n          16    predicted time between the beginning of the thiopental  \n \n          17    administration and the loss of consciousness. \n \n          18              MR. BERGER:  I think it said they may, isn't that  \n \n          19    right? \n \n          20              MR. PRITCHETT:  They may be based. \n \n          21              MR. BERGER:  That wouldn't have given us adequate  \n \n          22    notice to think about and deal with Dr. Dershwitz'  \n \n          23    conclusions. \n \n          24              THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.   \n \n          25    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  Did you consider in your report,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             283 \n \n \n \n           1    in your review of this case, the onset time of the  \n \n           2    effectiveness of thiopental to put a person at a sufficient  \n \n           3    level of unconsciousness so that it would be appropriate to  \n \n           4    administer the second two drugs in an execution? \n \n           5    A    Yes, I did. \n \n           6    Q    And how did you take account of that in your analysis? \n \n           7    A    Well, I had to work under various scenarios.  First of  \n \n           8    all, in the graphs that I submitted prior to my testimony  \n \n           9    in January I basically assumed that the five grams of  \n \n          10    thiopental would be in 200 milliliters of volume because  \n \n          11    that is the volume that we typically use clinically and I  \n \n          12    used a one milliliter per second injection time.  And in  \n \n          13    that scenario the probability of consciousness at the time  \n \n          14    that the second drug would be administered is a minuscule  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 23of 124\n \n          15    fraction of one percent.  And that number is specified in  \n \n          16    my report.  I don't remember how many 9s after 99 percent  \n \n          17    it is, but it's a tiny number.   \n \n          18              I now understand that that assumption was  \n \n          19    probably not accurate in terms of how the thiopental was  \n \n          20    mixed and administered. \n \n          21    Q    How do you understand the thiopental has been mixed  \n \n          22    and administered in Missouri now? \n \n          23    A    In the recent executions my understanding is that when  \n \n          24    2.5 grams were used, the smallest volume of diluent that  \n \n          25    could be achieved as far as getting the drug into solution  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             284 \n \n \n \n           1    was used.  And that the injection was probably completed in  \n \n           2    a minute or less.  Even in that scenario, the probability  \n \n           3    of consciousness at the time the second drug would begin to  \n \n           4    be given is still a tiny fraction of one percent. \n \n           5    Q    If five grams of thiopental was administered at an  \n \n           6    execution, and let's assume that it's actually brought into  \n \n           7    the body, is there any need for a monitoring of the  \n \n           8    anesthetic depth of the condemned prisoner, in your view? \n \n           9    A    I don't think it's necessary. \n \n          10    Q    And can you tell us why not? \n \n          11    A    Because it is inconceivable that there's any human who  \n \n          12    could possibly remain awake after such a large dose of  \n \n          13    thiopental being properly administered into a working  \n \n          14    intravenous catheter. \n \n          15    Q    Would the same be true at a somewhat lower dose of  \n \n          16    thiopental, say 2.5 grams? \n \n          17    A    Yes.  And in fact, I have testified elsewhere that  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 24of 124\n \n          18    even doses as low as 1.5 grams will provide a high enough  \n \n          19    probability of unconsciousness so that, in my opinion, an  \n \n          20    execution would be humane. \n \n          21    Q    Based on your clinical experience, based on the North  \n \n          22    Carolina experience and the recent execution, what do you  \n \n          23    conclude with regard to the effective onset time of the  \n \n          24    administration of, say, five grams of thiopental? \n \n          25    A    Well, as I have said before, loss of consciousness in  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             285 \n \n \n \n           1    the typical human occurs after the successful delivery of  \n \n           2    approximately 200 to 300 milligrams of thiopental.  And so  \n \n           3    the delivery of increasing doses acts to decrease the level  \n \n           4    of consciousness as well as to increase the duration of  \n \n           5    unconsciousness. \n \n           6              However, I also have to mention that at these  \n \n           7    large multi-gram doses, duration is not a meaningful term  \n \n           8    because although I could predict that the duration of  \n \n           9    unconsciousness would last for hours, and I believe  \n \n          10    Dr. Henthorn confirmed that in his calculations, in reality  \n \n          11    if we do not support the circulation and ventilation of the  \n \n          12    person, the person will die from decreased oxygen delivery  \n \n          13    to, you know, peripheral tissues, so duration is not in my  \n \n          14    opinion a very meaningful term to discuss in this context. \n \n          15              I think everyone agrees on both sides of this  \n \n          16    issue that if several grams are successfully administered,  \n \n          17    the person will remain unconscious for a period of time far  \n \n          18    in excess of that which is required to complete a typical  \n \n          19    execution. \n \n          20    Q    Stepping back from the durational component to the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 25of 124\n \n          21    initial effective onset, how long it takes the thiopental  \n \n          22    to reach a level at which an individual will be  \n \n          23    unconscious, a five-gram dose will reach, in your view,  \n \n          24    that level of unconsciousness after approximately what  \n \n          25    time? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             286 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, first of all, unconsciousness will be achieved  \n \n           2    once the first two to 300 milligrams circulate, and that  \n \n           3    will take, you know, typically 30 seconds to 45 seconds in  \n \n           4    the average person.  And so as increasing amounts of  \n \n           5    thiopental are given, from the person's perspective who is  \n \n           6    receiving the drug nothing is different because once  \n \n           7    unconsciousness is achieved, the depth of unconsciousness,  \n \n           8    although perceptible to a clinician who is looking at an  \n \n           9    EEG, is not perceptible to a person receiving the drug.   \n \n          10    And so once the first few hundred milligrams circulate,  \n \n          11    which typically takes 30 to 45 seconds, the person is  \n \n          12    unconscious and they will remain unconscious for quite a  \n \n          13    period of time after the rest of the dose is given. \n \n          14    Q    Are you aware of scenarios in the induction of general  \n \n          15    anesthesia when an anesthesiologist in an ordinary medical  \n \n          16    practice is not at the edge of the bed of the patient  \n \n          17    receiving the anesthesia? \n \n          18    A    It does happen occasionally.  One scenario that I  \n \n          19    could envision, because this has happened to me, when we  \n \n          20    provide care for a patient undergoing certain procedures  \n \n          21    like an MRI scan, typically the anesthesia providers are  \n \n          22    located in an adjacent room and all of our equipment is  \n \n          23    located in the adjacent room because our equipment is not  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 26of 124\n \n          24    typically compatible with a strong magnetic field in an MRI  \n \n          25    scanner.  And so a scenario in which I can envision this  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             287 \n \n \n \n           1    happening is -- and I should tell you, first of all, the  \n \n           2    vast majority of patients who need MRI scans do not need  \n \n           3    anesthesia.  The vast majority of people could properly go  \n \n           4    into the scanner and lie there still and undergo their scan  \n \n           5    without any problem.   \n \n           6              When they ask an anesthesiologist to become  \n \n           7    involved it's typically in a critically ill patient or in a  \n \n           8    patient who for whatever reason is unable to hold still or  \n \n           9    be cooperative.  And sometimes we will provide intravenous  \n \n          10    sedation so that the person is sleepy but not unconscious.   \n \n          11    Sometimes we deliberately induce general anesthesia to  \n \n          12    render the person completely unconscious.  And sometimes,  \n \n          13    and this has happened at my experience, where we attempted  \n \n          14    to provide intravenous sedation, partway through the  \n \n          15    procedure the radiologist said the patient is either moving  \n \n          16    too much and then we make the decision to go from sedation  \n \n          17    to general anesthesia, and we may do that remotely, meaning  \n \n          18    I give additional medication from my point of observation  \n \n          19    in the control room approximately 15 feet away from the  \n \n          20    patient and have them make the transition from sedation to  \n \n          21    general anesthesia. \n \n          22    Q    And how are you able to, in this situation, administer  \n \n          23    additional anesthesia to the patient who is in the MRI  \n \n          24    machine? \n \n          25    A    Typically we're giving the anesthetic medications  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             288 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 27of 124\n \n \n \n           1    intravenously so I would tell the infusion pump to give an  \n \n           2    additional and higher dose. \n \n           3    Q    I'm at a much more basic level.  How does it get from  \n \n           4    where you are to the patient? \n \n           5    A    Through 15 feet or so of intravenous tubing.   \n \n           6    Q    I'd like to change topics here and talk about  \n \n           7    potassium chloride for a second.  Without use of  \n \n           8    anesthesia, would the administration of potassium chloride  \n \n           9    cause pain in an individual when it reaches the heart?  \n \n          10              MS. ANDERS:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's not  \n \n          11    covered in the expert report. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  We can't have both of you objecting.   \n \n          13    Only one of you is covering this witness and you need to  \n \n          14    make up your mind which one it is.   \n \n          15              Objection will be overruled.  \n \n          16    A    First of all, whether or not potassium chloride harms  \n \n          17    the person or causes pain on injection is dependent upon  \n \n          18    the concentration and the cumulative dose.  So, for  \n \n          19    example, we routinely give dilute potassium chloride to  \n \n          20    patients as part of our routine intravenous fluids.  When  \n \n          21    the concentration of potassium chloride is high, it could  \n \n          22    cause irritation to veins and cause pain.  When the  \n \n          23    cumulative dose of potassium chloride is very high, it  \n \n          24    will cause the heart to stop and for a few seconds before  \n \n          25    consciousness is lost the person will experience pain in  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             289 \n \n \n \n           1    the chest that is similar to what a person experiences when  \n \n           2    they're having a heart attack. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 28of 124\n \n           3    Q    So without anesthesia, when potassium hits the heart,  \n \n           4    and I'm not talking about the administration and getting to  \n \n           5    the heart yet.  When it gets to the heart, how long will  \n \n           6    consciousness last, approximately? \n \n           7    A    Well, if we assume that when the potassium chloride  \n \n           8    reaches the heart, the heart stops -- \n \n           9    Q    And I'm talking about a dose like we use in  \n \n          10    executions. \n \n          11    A    So when hundreds of milliequivalents are given, when  \n \n          12    that potassium chloride reaches the heart and the heart is  \n \n          13    monitored with an electrocardiogram, electrical activity in  \n \n          14    the heart stops almost immediately.  And so the heart will  \n \n          15    stop beating and circulation will cease. \n \n          16              Typically when circulation ceases consciousness  \n \n          17    lasts, and again in an unmedicated person, approximately  \n \n          18    ten seconds, because the brain has essentially no \n \n          19    significant oxygen or energy reserves.  And during that  \n \n          20    ten-second period with the heart not receiving any blood,  \n \n          21    the person would experience angina pain similar to the pain  \n \n          22    that a person is having when they're having a heart attack. \n \n          23    Q    So if I understand correctly, without anesthesia when  \n \n          24    a huge dose of potassium chloride gets to the heart it  \n \n          25    would render -- it would cause some pain comparable to a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             290 \n \n \n \n           1    heart attack?  \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    And last for ten seconds at most? \n \n           4    A    Yeah.  The typical person loses consciousness about  \n \n           5    ten seconds after cessation of circulation. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 29of 124\n \n           6    Q    So in that scenario, Doctor, is it accurate to say the  \n \n           7    pain would last the five to ten seconds of the cessation of  \n \n           8    circulation? \n \n           9    A    Approximately.   \n \n          10    Q    I'd like to turn now to femoral IV access.  Can you  \n \n          11    describe for us advantages to the use of femoral IV access  \n \n          12    over peripheral IV access? \n \n          13    A    I think in general one could say that a femoral IV  \n \n          14    would be more reliable in terms of it being less likely to  \n \n          15    migrate to a place where it's not supposed to be, like  \n \n          16    outside of the vessel.  And it is located closer to the  \n \n          17    central circulation so that the medication or anything  \n \n          18    given through the femoral catheter is going to reach the \n \n          19    heart a little more quickly.  And since the goal of giving  \n \n          20    intravenous medication is to make sure that it is induced  \n \n          21    in the vein and not somewhere else.  Although peripheral  \n \n          22    IVs tend to be very reliable when properly placed, I would  \n \n          23    say femoral IV is very, very reliable.  So it just  \n \n          24    increases the reliability, and the likelihood of failure is  \n \n          25    decreased. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             291 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    What about with regard to an incorrect insertion of  \n \n           2    the catheter that would lead to the delivery of drugs  \n \n           3    instead of into the vein into subcutaneous tissue; which,  \n \n           4    the peripheral or femoral, is more likely to avoid that  \n \n           5    complication? \n \n           6    A    Certainly hitting the femoral vein is easy because  \n \n           7    it's huge in the typical person, so once the catheter is in  \n \n           8    place it's very easy to check that it is intravascular  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 30of 124\n \n           9    because one can readily withdraw blood from it, or through  \n \n          10    it.  So confirmation of it being in the right place is  \n \n          11    easy.  And once it's there, it tends to stay put. \n \n          12    Q    How would you compare peripheral access vs. femoral  \n \n          13    access with regard to the chance of perforation or rupture  \n \n          14    or leakage of the vein? \n \n          15    A    Well, in both cases it's small, but with a femoral  \n \n          16    catheter it's even smaller because the vessel itself is  \n \n          17    larger, has a thicker wall, is stronger, it's harder to  \n \n          18    perforate, et cetera. \n \n          19    Q    So in general, would it be fair to say that drugs  \n \n          20    administered through a femoral IV access are more likely  \n \n          21    to be delivered into the vein as we expect to do than with  \n \n          22    regard to a peripheral IV? \n \n          23    A    Well, again very slightly increased reliability  \n \n          24    because even a peripheral IV properly placed has a very  \n \n          25    high degree of reliability, but that degree is increased  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             292 \n \n \n \n           1    ever so slightly more by having it in the femoral vein. \n \n           2    Q    We have had testimony in the case about an article in  \n \n           3    the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding a  \n \n           4    17 percent complication rate for femoral IV access.  Are  \n \n           5    you aware of that article? \n \n           6    A    I actually read it.   \n \n           7    Q    What type of patients were being studied in regard to  \n \n           8    that article that reached the 17 percent complication rate? \n \n           9    A    Well, all of these people were critically ill and in  \n \n          10    the intensive care unit. \n \n          11    Q    And what significance does that have with regard to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 31of 124\n \n          12    whether they would be more likely to have complications or  \n \n          13    less likely to have complications? \n \n          14    A    Well, first of all, although the authors did not  \n \n          15    specify specific risk factors, one of the characteristics  \n \n          16    of many, many patients in intensive care units is their  \n \n          17    decreased ability to coagulate blood.  So many patients in  \n \n          18    ICUs are deliberately anticoagulated.  And in addition,  \n \n          19    many patients have a decreased ability to clot blood simply  \n \n          20    because of their underlying disease, like if they have  \n \n          21    sepsis.  Sepsis is associated with a decreased ability to  \n \n          22    clot.  So it's not the least bit surprising that they would  \n \n          23    have a high incidence of hematoma because they're sticking  \n \n          24    these catheters in people who have a decreased ability --  \n \n          25    many of whom have a decreased ability, you know, to clot,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             293 \n \n \n \n           1    just based on the fact that they're intensive care  \n \n           2    patients. \n \n           3              Similarly, patients who are in the intensive care  \n \n           4    unit, many of them have low blood pressure.  That's why  \n \n           5    they're there.  And a patient with low blood pressure is  \n \n           6    going to have weaker peripheral pulses.  And in my  \n \n           7    experience, it is a little harder to locate the landmark,  \n \n           8    which is the femoral artery, which should have a very  \n \n           9    strong pulse.  And in some critically ill patients, the  \n \n          10    patients do not have a strong pulse because they're  \n \n          11    critically ill. \n \n          12    Q    Did the report, at least as far as can be told, look  \n \n          13    at complication rates of physicians with all levels of  \n \n          14    experience? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 32of 124\n \n          15    A    Well, one of the noteworthy things that the paper  \n \n          16    commented on, it was done at eight hospitals in France, and  \n \n          17    although they didn't specify which was which, two of the  \n \n          18    hospitals were noted to have a significantly increased or  \n \n          19    higher complication rate than the other six.  And although  \n \n          20    I certainly can't say this with any certainty, one possible  \n \n          21    explanation is that at the two hospitals that had higher  \n \n          22    complication rates, the people doing the procedures may  \n \n          23    have been less experienced.  For instance, they may have  \n \n          24    been residents or fellows in training. \n \n          25    Q    The complications that were reviewed in this article,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             294 \n \n \n \n           1    did that include complications that would not even manifest  \n \n           2    themselves for a length of time, say covering days? \n \n           3    A    One of the major things that the paper discussed was  \n \n           4    the infection rate, and of course an infection that is  \n \n           5    visible to a physician would take hours to days to manifest  \n \n           6    itself after the placement of the catheter. \n \n           7    Q    How long is a femoral catheter typically left in in a  \n \n           8    medical situation, a medical practice? \n \n           9    A    It could be weeks and weeks and weeks.  For instance,  \n \n          10    lots of patients who have femoral catheters for dialysis,  \n \n          11    the femoral catheter is kept in while waiting for their  \n \n          12    surgical dialysis access to mature. \n \n          13    Q    And how long, in your understanding, is the femoral IV  \n \n          14    catheter useful in an inmate being executed? \n \n          15    A    It's typically a matter of minutes.   \n \n          16    Q    In your clinical experience, what's the likelihood of  \n \n          17    damage to a femoral nerve that's caused as a result of an  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 33of 124\n \n          18    attempt to achieve femoral IV access, femoral venous  \n \n          19    access? \n \n          20    A    Well, thankfully it's never happened to me, and I view  \n \n          21    the likelihood of hitting the femoral nerve to be  \n \n          22    particularly remote. \n \n          23    Q    And why is that? \n \n          24    A    Because the landmark for placing a femoral venous  \n \n          25    catheter is the femoral artery which is the strongest pulse  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             295 \n \n \n \n           1    in the body, and although the femoral nerve is indeed  \n \n           2    located just adjacent to the femoral artery, so is the  \n \n           3    vein, but they're on opposite sides.  So as long as one is  \n \n           4    making the injection on the proper side of the artery, the  \n \n           5    likelihood of hitting the nerve is, in my mind,  \n \n           6    unbelievably remote. \n \n           7    Q    With regard to possible puncture of the femoral artery  \n \n           8    as opposed to the femoral vein, what's your experience as  \n \n           9    to the likelihood of that complication occurring? \n \n          10    A    Well, first of all, the femoral artery sometimes is  \n \n          11    contacted, but when the femoral venous catheter is placed,  \n \n          12    the typical procedure involves using what's called a finder  \n \n          13    needle first.  And a finder needle, depending on the  \n \n          14    manufacturer and the kit, is typically a .22 or .25 gauge  \n \n          15    needle, which is a small, a small needle.  And one probes  \n \n          16    with this needle to make sure that one is in the right  \n \n          17    place.  And it's typically pretty easy to tell the  \n \n          18    difference between being in the vein and being in the  \n \n          19    artery because the arterial blood is bright red and the  \n \n          20    venous blood is not.  And the arterial blood pulses at high  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 34of 124\n \n          21    pressure and the venous blood does not. \n \n          22              If one accidentally goes into the femoral artery  \n \n          23    with a .22 or .25 gauge needle, then one could apply  \n \n          24    pressure for a few seconds and there will be essentially no  \n \n          25    bleeding.  And then one also knows that if they have gone  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             296 \n \n \n \n           1    into the artery, they need to move over a little bit more  \n \n           2    to get into the femoral vein. \n \n           3              Once the femoral vein is properly entered with  \n \n           4    the small needle, typically .22 or .25 gauge, then that  \n \n           5    needle is removed and a second needle is inserted in the  \n \n           6    same site and in the same direction.  That's typically an  \n \n           7    .18 gauge needle, and it is that needle through which the  \n \n           8    wire is then placed and then the catheter itself is  \n \n           9    threaded over the wire. \n \n          10    Q    So in your clinical experience, what's the  \n \n          11    significance of, when it does happen, going into the  \n \n          12    femoral artery rather than the femoral vein as it's being  \n \n          13    inserted? \n \n          14    A    It's generally not a big deal at all.  We have all hit  \n \n          15    the femoral artery on occasion and I have never had a  \n \n          16    complication that required intervention, personally. \n \n          17    Q    And I think you said the solution, the action to take  \n \n          18    is to put pressure -- \n \n          19    A    Correct. \n \n          20    Q    -- on the puncture site, I guess? \n \n          21    A    Correct. \n \n          22    Q    And how long? \n \n          23    A    Depending on the size of the hole, but with a .22 or  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 35of 124\n \n          24    .25 gauge finder needle, if one applies pressure for a  \n \n          25    minute or two in a person, a normal person, the hole will  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             297 \n \n \n \n           1    clot and bleeding will not occur. \n \n           2    Q    What's the likelihood, in your clinical experience,  \n \n           3    that a hematoma that results from an attempted femoral  \n \n           4    access will be clinically significant? \n \n           5    A    Well, sometimes there will be some blood leaking out  \n \n           6    around the catheter, and when the catheter is in the  \n \n           7    femoral vein, normal venous pressure is just a few  \n \n           8    millimeters of mercury, so even if some blood leaks out,  \n \n           9    because it's leaking out into a closed space, a process  \n \n          10    called tamponade will occur whereby the pressure in the  \n \n          11    enclosed space will then exceed the pressure in the vein  \n \n          12    and the bleeding will stop.  So if somebody is going to get  \n \n          13    a hematoma from a femoral venous catheter, it's more likely \n \n          14    to occur in somebody who is anticoagulated or has some  \n \n          15    other abnormality like that.  But in a normal person,  \n \n          16    significant hematoma formation from a femoral venous line  \n \n          17    is not typical, and I can't remember ever needing to take  \n \n          18    care of a patient who came to the O.R. whose hematoma was  \n \n          19    due to femoral venous catheterization. \n \n          20    Q    There's been some testimony in this case from  \n \n          21    Dr. Johnson that a typical step, a standard step in the  \n \n          22    insertion of a femoral IV by means of the Seldinger method  \n \n          23    is to poke the needle through the vein and into the bone  \n \n          24    that lies beneath the vein. \n \n          25              In your experience, is going through the vein  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             298 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 36of 124\n \n \n \n           1    and hitting the bone a usual and intended event in the  \n \n           2    insertion of a femoral catheter? \n \n           3    A    Well, it's not the way I do it and it's not the way I  \n \n           4    teach my residents to do it.  The way I do it is I insert  \n \n           5    first a finder needle to locate the site and the  \n \n           6    approximate depth of the vein and then remove that needle  \n \n           7    and insert the .18 gauge needle.  And as soon as I achieve  \n \n           8    venous blood flow, with the tip of the needle in the middle  \n \n           9    of the lumen of the vein, I then thread the wire and remove  \n \n          10    the needle. \n \n          11              So I'm not saying it's impossible to perforate  \n \n          12    the back wall of the vessel or hit the bone, but it is  \n \n          13    certainly not deliberate on my part and it's certainly not  \n \n          14    something, the way I would teach other people to do it. \n \n          15    Q    Is the injection of potassium chloride into the  \n \n          16    femoral vein less likely to be a painful process than  \n \n          17    injection of potassium chloride through a peripheral vein? \n \n          18    A    Yes, I believe so, although in clinical medicine we  \n \n          19    don't use potassium chloride quite as concentrated as is  \n \n          20    used during a lethal injection.  It is commonplace to  \n \n          21    administer potassium chloride at a concentration that would  \n \n          22    not be recommended peripherally.  So the particular  \n \n          23    concentration of potassium employed when it's used in  \n \n          24    my hospital therapeutically is 0.4 milliequivalents per  \n \n          25    milliliter.  That would be 20 milliequivalents in a volume  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             299 \n \n \n \n           1    of 50 milliliters.  That solution is not permitted in my  \n \n           2    hospital, and in other hospitals with which I have been  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 37of 124\n \n           3    associated, that's not permitted to be given through a  \n \n           4    peripheral IV.  It has to be given through a central vein,  \n \n           5    and through a central vein at that concentration patients  \n \n           6    do not experience pain.   \n \n           7    Q    And why is it less likely to have pain and in this  \n \n           8    case not pain at all from the administration of potassium  \n \n           9    chloride in a femoral vein vs. a peripheral vein.  \n \n          10    Physiologically, what's going on that makes it less  \n \n          11    painful? \n \n          12    A    When it's going into a femoral vein or the subclavian  \n \n          13    vein or other large vein that's near the central  \n \n          14    circulation, the blood flow is much higher than in the arm  \n \n          15    in terms of the milliliters per second that are flowing  \n \n          16    past that point in the vessel.  And the volume in which the  \n \n          17    medication is being diluted is much greater.  So it's the  \n \n          18    actual concentration of the potassium chloride that hurts.   \n \n          19    And so once the potassium chloride is diluted, it's going  \n \n          20    to hurt less.  And it's going to be more readily and more  \n \n          21    rapidly diluted when it is placed into a central vein as  \n \n          22    compared to a peripheral vein. \n \n          23    Q    Are you aware of any jurisdictions in the United  \n \n          24    States that have chosen femoral IV access as the standard  \n \n          25    for executions besides Missouri? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             300 \n \n \n \n           1    A    My understanding is the federal government also uses  \n \n           2    the femoral venous route as its preferred route. \n \n           3    Q    Are you aware of any class of physicians that would  \n \n           4    commonly obtain femoral IV access with the use of local  \n \n           5    anesthesia only? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 38of 124\n \n           6    A    Yes.  In my experience and the hospital in which I  \n \n           7    work now, as well as in other hospitals with which I have  \n \n           8    been affiliated, although surgeons sometimes bring patients  \n \n           9    to the operating room for placement of some types of  \n \n          10    catheters, nephrologists, who are the specialists who deal  \n \n          11    with patients with chronic renal failure, they're the ones  \n \n          12    who are often consulted when a patient is needing dialysis,  \n \n          13    and surgeons may be asked to perform surgery to create a  \n \n          14    permanent and long-lasting dialysis access.  But typically  \n \n          15    from the time the surgeon does the operation to the time  \n \n          16    that it's ready to be used is measured as weeks or months.   \n \n          17    And in the meantime temporary dialysis catheters are often  \n \n          18    inserted by nephrologists.  It's typically a bedside   \n \n          19    procedure, and it's typically done with local anesthesia to  \n \n          20    provide comfort and no sedation whatsoever. \n \n          21    Q    I believe you said that's at least a fairly common  \n \n          22    practice at the medical facilities that you're familiar  \n \n          23    with? \n \n          24    A    Yes.  Temporary dialysis catheters are placed by  \n \n          25    nephrologists in my institution all the time.  These  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             301 \n \n \n \n           1    patients don't come to the operating room.  They don't go  \n \n           2    to the recovery room afterward.  They don't get sedation.   \n \n           3    And, you know, this is not considered by the nephrologist  \n \n           4    or by the patients to be a particularly noxious procedure. \n \n           5    Q    So in your view, is the use of femoral IV access for  \n \n           6    the administration of lethal chemicals in the case we're  \n \n           7    here for today a reasonable choice to be made? \n \n           8    A    I think it is a reasonable option, balancing the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 39of 124\n \n           9    advantages and disadvantages of all the different options. \n \n          10              MR. PRITCHETT:  I think I am at an end, or near  \n \n          11    an end, Judge.  If I could have a moment to consult with  \n \n          12    cocounsel.   \n \n          13              Just briefly, Judge. \n \n          14    Q    The low doses that are typically used in a surgical  \n \n          15    procedure, do those have an effect on cardiac output? \n \n          16    A    You're speaking of low doses of thiopental? \n \n          17    Q    Yes.  Thank you.  Sorry.  I did not specify that.  \n \n          18    A    The typical dose of thiopental, a few hundred  \n \n          19    milligrams, may drop the blood pressure by a small amount,  \n \n          20    but it typically does not affect the cardiac output to a  \n \n          21    meaningful degree as far as the circulation time. \n \n          22              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you very much, Doctor.   \n \n          23    That's all I have for you at this time.   \n \n          24    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. ANDERS:  \n \n          25    Q    Good morning.  Have you published anything on  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             302 \n \n \n \n           1    thiopental? \n \n           2    A    I have published a fair number of chapters about  \n \n           3    general anesthetic, intravenous anesthetic, in review books  \n \n           4    and, for example, in one of the major standard textbooks of  \n \n           5    anesthesiology that is in the process of being revised I  \n \n           6    have a chapter on intravenous anesthetic which certainly  \n \n           7    includes an extensive discussion of the pharmacology of  \n \n           8    thiopental.  I have also written about it and its use in  \n \n           9    other chapters I have written elsewhere. \n \n          10    Q    So textbook chapters, you rely on other sources for  \n \n          11    that; is that correct? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 40of 124\n \n          12    A    Typically, yes. \n \n          13    Q    You cite other sources.  Have you published any human  \n \n          14    studies on thiopental in peer review journals? \n \n          15    A    No. \n \n          16    Q    And I believe that Dr. Henthorn has done extensive  \n \n          17    research and studies in thiopental, particularly the onset  \n \n          18    of thiopental, the onset time; is that correct? \n \n          19    A    Yes.  He and I have done very similar work.  His work  \n \n          20    on thiopental is very similar to my work on propofol, which  \n \n          21    is another hypnotic. \n \n          22    Q    Have you ever received a grant to study thiopental? \n \n          23    A    No. \n \n          24    Q    And would you seek out Dr. Henthorn's judgment if you  \n \n          25    had a question about the onset of thiopental particularly? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             303 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, his work on the rapid and early circulation of  \n \n           2    thiopental is one of the sources that I have considered, as  \n \n           3    well as the work of others. \n \n           4    Q    And I believe you stated in your expert report that  \n \n           5    the graphs you've done in this case are based on the work  \n \n           6    by Dr. Henthorn; is that correct? \n \n           7    A    A portion of the consideration is based upon his work  \n \n           8    as well as the work of others.  I did not rely on the  \n \n           9    kinetic set based solely on one person's work because I  \n \n          10    wanted to make sure it was more extrapolatable to the  \n \n          11    general population.  But I certainly did include  \n \n          12    consideration of his published work. \n \n          13    Q    What other published works did you rely on? \n \n          14    A    Another lab that has done a fair bit of work on  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 41of 124\n \n          15    thiopental is the lab at Stanford and Doctors Stanski and  \n \n          16    Shafer and Mada are amongst the authors who published  \n \n          17    extensively on the kinetics of thiopental. \n \n          18    Q    And where was the data that was relied on published?   \n \n          19    Is there an article you can cite? \n \n          20    A    Off the top of my head I would say it was probably in  \n \n          21    the Journal of Anesthesiology or at least some of the  \n \n          22    papers were in the Journal of Anesthesiology, but I'd have  \n \n          23    to go back and look again. \n \n          24    Q    Do you remember about when those papers were  \n \n          25    published? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             304 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Late '80s, early '90s approximately, I believe. \n \n           2    Q    And I believe you testified previously that in this  \n \n           3    case, that -- and this is on page 32 of the transcript, the  \n \n           4    detailed -- I quote, \"The detailed kinetic and dynamic  \n \n           5    predictions that I made for thiopental rely on  \n \n           6    state-of-the-art studies that were performed on human  \n \n           7    volunteers.\"  So I take it you were referring to Dr.  \n \n           8    Henthorn's article and the Stanski article as well; is that  \n \n           9    correct? \n \n          10    A    Yes, both of them published lots of things in human  \n \n          11    volunteers. \n \n          12    Q    And I believe that Dr. Henthorn's article that you  \n \n          13    cited specifically was published in 1989; is that correct? \n \n          14    A    In clinical pharmacology and therapeutics, yes. \n \n          15    Q    And I think you just testified that the Stanski and  \n \n          16    Shafer articles were also about the late '80s or early  \n \n          17    '90s? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 42of 124\n \n          18    A    They were contemporaneously published within a year or  \n \n          19    two of each year. \n \n          20    Q    So do you consider data from 1989 to be  \n \n          21    state-of-the-art in this field? \n \n          22    A    Yes, simply because since thiopental was essentially  \n \n          23    abandoned in anesthesia use in the early '90s, people  \n \n          24    stopped doing high-level research on thiopental and chose  \n \n          25    to explore other drugs like propofol. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             305 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Are you aware of whether Dr. Henthorn has continued  \n \n           2    publishing on thiopental? \n \n           3    A    He may have.  I can't cite any papers off the top of  \n \n           4    my head beyond the early '90s. \n \n           5    Q    Would you be surprised if I told you that Dr. Henthorn  \n \n           6    has received eleven years of grants to study thiopental and  \n \n           7    that has continued into the past few years? \n \n           8    A    No, that wouldn't surprise me at all, but the area in  \n \n           9    which he is studying is not exactly the same as which he  \n \n          10    did in the late '80s and early '90s. \n \n          11    Q    I see.  So I believe you testified that it's not  \n \n          12    necessary to monitor anesthetic depth assuming a five-gram  \n \n          13    dose or 2.5 gram dose of thiopental is successfully given;  \n \n          14    is that correct? \n \n          15    A    Yes.  And my understanding is that people --  \n \n          16    anesthesiologists on both sides of this issue have agreed  \n \n          17    that the successful delivery of this large dose of  \n \n          18    thiopental will result in a humane execution. \n \n          19    Q    And I believe -- well, let me ask you.  When you did  \n \n          20    your graphs back in January for this case and you  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 43of 124\n \n          21    testified, did you assume that a five-gram dose of  \n \n          22    thiopental would be successfully given into the  \n \n          23    circulation? \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    And that turned out to be false, didn't it? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             306 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    Why not? \n \n           3    A    I have no evidence that the catheter malfunctioned or  \n \n           4    that the medication was not delivered into the central  \n \n           5    circulation. \n \n           6    Q    What is your understanding of the intended dose of  \n \n           7    thiopental in the past five executions in Missouri? \n \n           8    A    Well, now I understand.  The intended dose was five  \n \n           9    grams and the delivered dose was 2.5, grams and as far as  \n \n          10    I know, there's no reason to think that the delivered dose  \n \n          11    was not delivered successfully into the central  \n \n          12    circulation. \n \n          13    Q    And are you able to tell definitively from the  \n \n          14    documents in this case and the testimony, deposition  \n \n          15    testimony of John Doe One, precisely how much thiopental  \n \n          16    was given on a particular occasion? \n \n          17    A    Well, I believe he said it was 2.5 grams resulting  \n \n          18    from the preparation of five 500-milligram injection kits. \n \n          19    Q    And are you certain about that? \n \n          20    A    I'm as certain as he was when he testified to that  \n \n          21    point. \n \n          22    Q    Are you aware of discrepancies in the chemical log  \n \n          23    with respect to how many vials of thiopental were checked  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 44of 124\n \n          24    out and precisely how much thiopental was given? \n \n          25    A    I have read references to that and I have to admit I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             307 \n \n \n \n           1    don't understand what is going on there. \n \n           2    Q    Have you reviewed the chemical log yourself? \n \n           3    A    No. \n \n           4    Q    And I believe you stated that you made an assumption  \n \n           5    with respect to the amount of diluent, is that correct,  \n \n           6    back in January? \n \n           7    A    Correct.  I assumed that the solution to be injected  \n \n           8    would be 2.5 percent, which is that concentration that is  \n \n           9    clinically used. \n \n          10    Q    And that assumption turned out not to be correct in  \n \n          11    terms of the facts in this case? \n \n          12    A    That appears to be the case. \n \n          13    Q    And did you also make an assumption with regard to the  \n \n          14    injection times in Missouri? \n \n          15    A    Well, originally I assumed that the five grams would  \n \n          16    be injected at the rate of one milliliter per second. \n \n          17    Q    And that turned out not to be correct? \n \n          18    A    Correct. \n \n          19    Q    And if there's a leakage to the connection between the  \n \n          20    tubing and the catheter -- a partial disconnect, could that  \n \n          21    be undetected in an execution? \n \n          22    A    Anything is possible.  However, once the IV tubing is  \n \n          23    put together, in my experience, I have a very difficult  \n \n          24    time imagining a disconnect just happening, because the  \n \n          25    pieces screw together.  But I will concede that anything  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             308 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 45of 124\n \n \n \n           1    is possible. \n \n           2    Q    Are you aware of whether the execution team in  \n \n           3    Missouri can observe the catheter site? \n \n           4    A    I don't know if they can actually see the catheter  \n \n           5    site itself.   \n \n           6    Q    So you don't know whether there's a sheet covering it  \n \n           7    or not? \n \n           8    A    I believe that there is a sheet covering the inmate  \n \n           9    and they can see parts of the IV tubing and can't see all  \n \n          10    of it. \n \n          11    Q    If I told you that the sheet went up to the inmate's  \n \n          12    neck and came fully down both sides of the bed, would you  \n \n          13    have an opinion as to whether they can see the catheter  \n \n          14    site? \n \n          15    A    They probably can't see the catheter site itself. \n \n          16    Q    If 80 percent of the drugs leaked at some point  \n \n          17    through the tubing or the catheter site, how much  \n \n          18    thiopental went into the body? \n \n          19    A    Well, if the intended dose was five grams and  \n \n          20    80 percent of it leaked, then only one gram would reach  \n \n          21    the patient. \n \n          22    Q    And do you agree that one gram of thiopental is an  \n \n          23    insufficient dose for chronic drug addicts? \n \n          24    A    Well, first of all, it's inconceivable to me that an  \n \n          25    inmate on death row is currently using illicit drugs.  So  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             309 \n \n \n \n           1    if a person has a remote history of drug abuse but has been  \n \n           2    clean for years, then they are expected to respond normally  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 46of 124\n \n           3    to a dose of thiopental.  I would say, though, that in my  \n \n           4    opinion, one gram of thiopental is probably not an adequate  \n \n           5    dose for a judicial execution in anybody.  But I don't  \n \n           6    think that a former drug addict is any different from  \n \n           7    anybody else, assuming they have not been able to use  \n \n           8    illicit drugs while confined in the penitentiary. \n \n           9    Q    So you don't think the fact that somebody who is a  \n \n          10    chronic drug addict particularly would render one gram of  \n \n          11    thiopental an insufficient dose? \n \n          12    A    As I said, in my opinion, one gram is not an adequate  \n \n          13    dose for a judicial execution.  If a person has a prior  \n \n          14    history of drug use but has been clean for years, they  \n \n          15    don't respond differently than somebody who has never  \n \n          16    had a history of drug abuse.  And so for a person to be  \n \n          17    considered different, I would want to see evidence that  \n \n          18    they continued to use in the recent past, which I would  \n \n          19    think would be very difficult to imagine in an incarcerated  \n \n          20    inmate.  But if you showed me evidence to the contrary,  \n \n          21    then I would consider it. \n \n          22    Q    So you say that one gram would be, in your view,  \n \n          23    insufficient for a judicial execution.  Would it be  \n \n          24    insufficient to ensure that a drug addict were sedated,  \n \n          25    just taking out the execution situation? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             310 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, certainly a gram of thiopental is going to  \n \n           2    sedate everybody to some degree or another because the drug  \n \n           3    is a sedative.  It's going to cause loss of consciousness  \n \n           4    in a substantial fraction of people.  In my opinion, the  \n \n           5    percentage of the population that would be reliably  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 47of 124\n \n           6    rendered unconscious by one gram is not high enough for a  \n \n           7    judicial execution.  But I'm saying this not with regard to  \n \n           8    drug addicts.  I'm saying this with regard to everybody in  \n \n           9    the population. \n \n          10    Q    So if I told you that John Doe One, the physician, in  \n \n          11    his deposition, page 12, stated that, \"I was quite aware  \n \n          12    that one gram in chronic addicts was an insufficient dose  \n \n          13    to ensure that they would be sedated,\" would you disagree  \n \n          14    with that statement? \n \n          15    A    I think it depends on your definition of a drug  \n \n          16    addict.  If the person was using up until the recent past,  \n \n          17    that's one type of patient.  But a person who has been  \n \n          18    forced to be abstaining from drugs because they're  \n \n          19    incarcerated is a completely different type of patient. \n \n          20              THE COURT:  Why don't we take a brief recess  \n \n          21    here, about ten minutes or so.   \n \n          22              And I will remind you, Ms. Anders, that you do  \n \n          23    have a limited amount of time.  You may, at your peril, not  \n \n          24    get to critical issues to cover in this examination.   \n \n          25              We'll stand in recess.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             311 \n \n \n \n           1                      (Recess)  \n \n           2    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Just to go back to a previous \n \n           3    question briefly, Dr. Dershwitz.  If the intended dose of  \n \n           4    thiopental is 2.5 grams and 80 percent of it leaks, how  \n \n           5    much thiopental would enter the circulation? \n \n           6    A    I think 500. \n \n           7    Q    500 -- \n \n           8    A    Milligrams. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 48of 124\n \n           9    Q    Milligrams.  So I think -- I believe you testified  \n \n          10    that in a rapid sequence induction you skipped the testing  \n \n          11    of anesthetic depth because of a medical indication?  \n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    So is it fair to say that you don't skip the testing  \n \n          14    of anesthetic depth all the time with every patient? \n \n          15    A    No.  We assess the depth of anesthesia if it's  \n \n          16    medically indicated and we don't if it's medically  \n \n          17    contraindicated. \n \n          18    Q    And I believe you testified about the medical  \n \n          19    indications of a rapid sequence induction.  Those involved  \n \n          20    the person not having properly fasted, things like that; is  \n \n          21    that correct? \n \n          22    A    Yes. \n \n          23    Q    Is it fair to say that most of those situations are  \n \n          24    emergency situations? \n \n          25    A    No, because a huge proportion of the population has  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             312 \n \n \n \n           1    symptoms of acid reflux and so people with that symptom are  \n \n           2    also at higher risk for aspiration so those are people who  \n \n           3    we would do rapid sequence induction also.  \n \n           4    Q    So it's specific medical issue that requires you to do  \n \n           5    rapid sequence induction? \n \n           6    A    Yes. \n \n           7    Q    And what is the medical indication of lethal  \n \n           8    injection? \n \n           9    A    Lethal injection is not a medical procedure. \n \n          10    Q    So why is it -- are there medical factors involved in  \n \n          11    an execution that require as a medical matter the use of  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 49of 124\n \n          12    something like a rapid sequence induction? \n \n          13    A    Well, I'm not sure I can answer the question because  \n \n          14    from start to finish it's not a medical procedure so I  \n \n          15    can't say that only a fraction of it is or is not. \n \n          16    Q    Is it necessary to induce general anesthesia in an  \n \n          17    execution? \n \n          18    A    It's necessary to provide unconsciousness. \n \n          19    Q    And providing unconsciousness using an anesthetic, is  \n \n          20    that a medical procedure? \n \n          21    A    Again, when it's ordered by the State I do not  \n \n          22    consider it a medical procedure. \n \n          23    Q    But the same actions are taken, the same drug, medical  \n \n          24    drug is used or a drug that is used in medicine; is that  \n \n          25    correct? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             313 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, the drug is the same.  I won't say that the same  \n \n           2    actions are taken, but I would say of course the  \n \n           3    medications are used -- that are used are also typically  \n \n           4    used in clinical medicine. \n \n           5    Q    So unconsciousness is induced in an inmate through the  \n \n           6    use of medication? \n \n           7    A    Yes. \n \n           8    Q    And so in that process, what justifies taking the  \n \n           9    increased risk of not monitoring anesthetic depth? \n \n          10    A    That's not for me to decide. \n \n          11    Q    I believe you discussed the BIS monitor briefly.  If  \n \n          12    you give a conscious person a large dose of a paralytic  \n \n          13    drug like pancuronium, what will happen to the BIS value? \n \n          14    A    As far as I know, no one knows because it's never been  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 50of 124\n \n          15    studied.  Certainly one of the parameters that goes into  \n \n          16    the BIS value is the degree of muscle tone in the frontalis  \n \n          17    muscle, which is the muscle in the forehead, so the BIS  \n \n          18    value will drop to some indeterminate -- by some  \n \n          19    indeterminate degree if you paralyze someone awake, but  \n \n          20    as far as I know, that experiment has never been done. \n \n          21    Q    So you're not aware of a study in which that actually  \n \n          22    -- the use of a paralytic drug with a BIS monitor actually  \n \n          23    was studied? \n \n          24    A    I am unaware of a study in which a human was given a  \n \n          25    large dose of a paralytic drug with no sedation and had  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             314 \n \n \n \n           1    their BIS measured concurrently. \n \n           2    Q    So if the BIS monitor -- if the BIS value goes down  \n \n           3    upon the administration or after administration of  \n \n           4    pancuronium, can it provide an accurate measure of  \n \n           5    consciousness after the pancuronium is administered? \n \n           6    A    Absolutely, because it will drop like a rock after the  \n \n           7    thiopental is given. \n \n           8    Q    After the thiopental is given, yes, but after the  \n \n           9    thiopental is given and after the pancuronium is given can  \n \n          10    you trust its accuracy at that point? \n \n          11    A    Absolutely, because that's how we use it in clinical  \n \n          12    medicine.  Almost all of our patients -- a significant  \n \n          13    fraction of our patients under clinical anesthesia are also  \n \n          14    paralyzed and the BIS monitor works very reliably. \n \n          15    Q    Is the BIS monitor the only monitor that you use to  \n \n          16    measure anesthetic depth? \n \n          17    A    Of course not. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 51of 124\n \n          18    Q    What other monitors do you use? \n \n          19    A    We may use clinical factors like observation by the  \n \n          20    anesthesia team as well as observation by the surgeon. \n \n          21    Q    And is using a BIS monitor alone to monitor anesthetic  \n \n          22    depth, is that something that anesthesiologists generally  \n \n          23    do? \n \n          24    A    Not during surgery. \n \n          25    Q    During any procedure requiring general anesthesia? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             315 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Well, I can't think of any procedure that requires  \n \n           2    general anesthesia where nothing else is done later.  But  \n \n           3    another corollary might be in patients who are mechanically  \n \n           4    ventilated in intensive care units and are not undergoing  \n \n           5    surgery, the BIS monitor is commonly applied there to  \n \n           6    titrate the sedation to an adequate depth of sedation or  \n \n           7    loss of consciousness.  So in that scenario, the only  \n \n           8    procedure that's being performed is mechanical ventilation,  \n \n           9    and the primary end point to which the sedating medication  \n \n          10    is being titrated is the BIS value.  So in that scenario it  \n \n          11    is the primary monitor when it's chosen to be used in an  \n \n          12    intensive care unit. \n \n          13    Q    And that's not a situation in which the patient is  \n \n          14    subjected to painful stimulus; is that correct? \n \n          15    A    Well, having an endotracheal tube is painful. \n \n          16    Q    Do all anesthesiologists use a BIS monitor during  \n \n          17    general anesthesia? \n \n          18    A    Of course not. \n \n          19    Q    And should they? \n \n          20    A    In my opinion, yes, and I have written that.  With the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 52of 124\n \n          21    caveat that there are some subset of patients in whom the  \n \n          22    monitor is not appropriate, but I have written several  \n \n          23    review articles in which I advocated the use of the BIS  \n \n          24    monitor routinely in general anesthesia except when it was  \n \n          25    medically impossible. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             316 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And are you aware that the American Society of  \n \n           2    Anesthesiologists has issued a document stating that the  \n \n           3    BIS monitor is not the general standard of care? \n \n           4    A    Well, that's actually not what they said.  They  \n \n           5    recommended that the BIS monitor be considered on a  \n \n           6    case-by-case basis and that clinicians are free to choose  \n \n           7    to use it when they wish.  And they also recognized that  \n \n           8    there are certain subsets of the population for whom a  \n \n           9    higher risk of awareness is possible. \n \n          10    Q    They also stated that the BIS monitor is not indicated  \n \n          11    for sole use because there are other important measures of  \n \n          12    anesthetic depth; is that correct? \n \n          13    A    During surgery, that's true.  That's actually not the  \n \n          14    case when it's used in the intensive care unit, but the ASA  \n \n          15    policy statement did not address the use in the ICU. \n \n          16    Q    And I believe you testified that the injection time  \n \n          17    for thiopental in North Carolina is between 1 and 1.5  \n \n          18    minutes is that correct? \n \n          19    A    That's an approximation. \n \n          20    Q    Do you know how many seconds precisely the injection  \n \n          21    takes in North Carolina? \n \n          22    A    No, I do not. \n \n          23    Q    Do you know how many seconds it takes to inject the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 53of 124\n \n          24    thiopental in Missouri? \n \n          25    A    No, I do not. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             317 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Isn't it true that if thiopental is injected  \n \n           2    relatively slowly, it may have taken effect in the brain by  \n \n           3    the time the injection is complete? \n \n           4    A    The speed of the injection is less relevant than how  \n \n           5    long it takes to get the first few hundred milligrams in,  \n \n           6    and when one is using a concentrated solution it does not  \n \n           7    take very long to get two or 300 milligrams into the  \n \n           8    circulation.  How fast the overall syringe plunger is  \n \n           9    pushed is not terribly meaningful to this discussion. \n \n          10    Q    And the solution which the thiopental is mixed in  \n \n          11    Missouri, it's very concentrated; is that correct? \n \n          12    A    I believe the intent is to make it as concentrated as  \n \n          13    is achievable. \n \n          14    Q    So if the solution is extremely concentrated and the  \n \n          15    drug pushed quite quickly, do you have -- can you be  \n \n          16    certain whether the North Carolina execution is comparable  \n \n          17    to Missouri in terms of injection speed and the  \n \n          18    concentration of thiopental? \n \n          19    A    I actually think that it's probably not a meaningful  \n \n          20    difference because what's truly critical is the point at  \n \n          21    which we go from having no thiopental to let's say  \n \n          22    approximately 300 milligrams of thiopental.  And in the two  \n \n          23    scenarios that you described we're still talking about a  \n \n          24    difference of only a few seconds.  So, therefore, it is not  \n \n          25    a clinically meaningful difference. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             318 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 54of 124\n \n \n \n           1    Q    But you're not sure how great that difference is; is  \n \n           2    that correct? \n \n           3    A    I don't know exactly.  I don't know a lot of things  \n \n           4    exactly.  But we're talking about a matter of just a few  \n \n           5    seconds; a few being a small number. \n \n           6    Q    Did you see the BIS monitor read-outs from the Brown  \n \n           7    execution? \n \n           8    A    I was not there. \n \n           9    Q    So on what source are you basing your assertions about  \n \n          10    the BIS monitor in North Carolina? \n \n          11    A    The information was provided to me by the Attorney  \n \n          12    General's Office. \n \n          13    Q    Did you at that point see the BIS monitor read-outs? \n \n          14    A    I told you I was not there.  The material -- the  \n \n          15    information was provided to me by the Attorney General's  \n \n          16    Office. \n \n          17    Q    And did you bring with you today any of the  \n \n          18    information that was provided to you by the AG's Office? \n \n          19    A    No.  Well, I actually do have a copy of the e-mail on  \n \n          20    my computer. \n \n          21    Q    So you have an e-mail from the AG's Office? \n \n          22    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          23    Q    And would you rely on that in a medical situation? \n \n          24    A    I would rely on it in a judicial execution situation,  \n \n          25    which is obviously, in my opinion, not a medical situation. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             319 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Do you know Dr. Henthorn? \n \n           2    A    Very well.

He's also capable of making a mistake  \n \n           5    sometimes, as we all are. \n \n           6    Q    He knows more about the onset time of thiopental than  \n \n           7    you do; is that correct? \n \n           8    A    Not anymore. \n \n           9    Q    Have you received any funding to study the onset of -- \n \n          10              THE COURT:  Let's not get into argument with the  \n \n          11    Doctor.  Let's move on.  Your time is limited.   \n \n          12    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So is there a debate about the onset  \n \n          13    time of thiopental in the medical community? \n \n          14    A    There is now. \n \n          15    Q    So this is a situation which reasonable doctors can  \n \n          16    disagree; is that correct? \n \n          17    A    And I will be interested to see how much he disagrees  \n \n          18    once he realizes the mistake that he made. \n \n          19    Q    Are you certain that he's wrong? \n \n          20    A    Yes. \n \n          21    Q    Have you performed his models yourself? \n \n          22    A    Not in as great detail, but I discovered a flaw in an  \n \n          23    assumption on which the rest of his calculation is based. \n \n          24    Q    I believe you testified about an MRI situation where  \n \n          25    you maintain general anesthesia from a remote location; is  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             320 \n \n \n \n           1    that correct? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    In that situation, do you ever induce general  \n \n           4    anesthesia in an awake patient from a remote location? \n \n           5    A    Yes. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 56of 124\n \n           6    Q    And when do you do that? \n \n           7    A    As I said, it happens occasionally in the MRI  \n \n           8    environment. \n \n           9    Q    And the patient starts out awake? \n \n          10    A    Correct, awake but sedated.  And then the decision was  \n \n          11    made to switch from sedation to general anesthesia in the  \n \n          12    middle of the procedure and then I alter my anesthetic  \n \n          13    dosing so that the patient proceeds from a sedated state to  \n \n          14    an unconscious state. \n \n          15    Q    How many times have you done this? \n \n          16    A    A few.  I can't remember exactly.  It's not common,  \n \n          17    but it's certainly happened to me. \n \n          18    Q    Do you have any idea how many times in the past six  \n \n          19    months? \n \n          20    A    I can't put a number on it.  It's a small number.   \n \n          21    It's in single digits, but I can't tell you exactly. \n \n          22    Q    In those situations was the patient already intubated? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    And that means the patient was already heavily  \n \n          25    sedated; is that correct? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             321 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I guess it depends on your definition of heavily  \n \n           2    sedated.  They were not heavily sedated.  They were sedated  \n \n           3    to the point that they were comfortable but awake so they  \n \n           4    could follow commands. \n \n           5    Q    I believe you stated that being intubated is a fairly  \n \n           6    painful procedure, correct?  \n \n           7    A    Correct, but sedation per se does not mitigate the  \n \n           8    pain.  We would provide analgesics for pain relief and  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 57of 124\n \n           9    sedation for comfort. \n \n          10    Q    And did you monitor anesthetic depth when you used  \n \n          11    general anesthesia in those patients? \n \n          12    A    Actually the BIS monitor is not compatible in an MRI  \n \n          13    environment so I can't use it in that environment. \n \n          14    Q    Did you use any other monitor to measure anesthetic  \n \n          15    depth? \n \n          16    A    No, I didn't.  But may I add something.  The patient  \n \n          17    stopped moving and the radiologist told me it was -- the  \n \n          18    conditions were adequate for -- to proceed.  So I used that  \n \n          19    as a reasonable end point.   \n \n          20    Q    I believe you testified before that a typical clinical  \n \n          21    concentration of potassium is about .4 milliequivalents per  \n \n          22    milliliter, correct? \n \n          23    A    That is the concentration that we use when we're  \n \n          24    delivering a large amount to a central vein.  The  \n \n          25    concentration that would be delivered to a peripheral vein  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             322 \n \n \n \n           1    is much lower. \n \n           2    Q    Thank you.  And do you know what the concentration of  \n \n           3    potassium used in Missouri is? \n \n           4    A    I believe it's two milliequivalents per milliliter. \n \n           5    Q    How much higher is that than .4 milliequivalents per  \n \n           6    milliliter? \n \n           7    A    Well, it's two versus point four. \n \n           8    Q    So it's quite a bit higher? \n \n           9    A    Slightly higher. \n \n          10    Q    So a two to one ratio versus a four to one ratio; is  \n \n          11    that correct? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 58of 124\n \n          12    A    No, it's -- the concentration that Missouri uses is  \n \n          13    2 milliequivalents per milliliter.  The highest  \n \n          14    concentration that I'm aware of any hospital using is 0.4  \n \n          15    milliequivalents per milliliter.  So it's a difference 1.6  \n \n          16    milliequivalents per milliliter. \n \n          17    Q    Right.  But in terms of the concentration, how many  \n \n          18    times -- let me ask it this way.  How many times greater  \n \n          19    concentration is 2 milliequivalents per milliliter than .4  \n \n          20    milliequivalents per milliliter? \n \n          21    A    That question doesn't make sense to me.  The highest  \n \n          22    concentration used clinically, as far as I'm aware, is .4  \n \n          23    milliequivalents per milliliter.  The concentration used in  \n \n          24    Missouri is two milliequivalents per milliliter, so that is  \n \n          25    a difference of 1.6 milliequivalents per milliliter.  It's  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             323 \n \n \n \n           1    1.6 milliequivalents per milliliter higher in the judicial  \n \n           2    execution in Missouri than the highest concentration used  \n \n           3    in a hospital, of which I'm aware.  \n \n           4    Q    And is the concentration of two milliequivalents per  \n \n           5    milliliter ever used in a clinical setting? \n \n           6    A    Not that I'm aware of. \n \n           7    Q    Has any research been done on it? \n \n           8    A    I wouldn't know. \n \n           9    Q    So you don't know whether two milliequivalents per  \n \n          10    milliliter concentration would hurt in the femoral vein; is  \n \n          11    that correct? \n \n          12    A    If it did hurt it would hurt a lot less in the femoral  \n \n          13    vein than it would hurt peripherally, and my suspicion is,  \n \n          14    knowing the other highly-irritating drugs that are given  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 59of 124\n \n          15    centrally, that as far as I'm aware, no medication that  \n \n          16    hurts peripherally hurts when it's given centrally. \n \n          17    Q    Do you know what the concentration of the potassium  \n \n          18    would end up being in the femoral vein assuming that 240  \n \n          19    milliequivalents were injected within a minute?  \n \n          20    A    It would depend on blood flow.  It's a complicated  \n \n          21    calculation.  I can't do it in my head, but it depends on  \n \n          22    blood flow. \n \n          23    Q    Can you estimate the blood flow? \n \n          24    A    Not in my head. \n \n          25    Q    Okay.  So then you're not sure what the concentration  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             324 \n \n \n \n           1    of potassium would be in the femoral vein if it were  \n \n           2    injected -- \n \n           3    A    It would be very high, but I can't tell you exactly  \n \n           4    what it is. \n \n           5    Q    So in your opinion should lethal injection for  \n \n           6    execution be performed using a femoral vein catheter rather  \n \n           7    than a peripheral IV? \n \n           8    A    I believe that that is a public policy decision that  \n \n           9    should be made by those responsible, balancing the benefits  \n \n          10    and the risks.  It's not my job to decide what is, quote  \n \n          11    unquote, better.  I would make every effort to describe the  \n \n          12    advantages and disadvantages, the risks and benefits, and  \n \n          13    let those responsible for making the decision make the  \n \n          14    decision. \n \n          15    Q    And I believe you testified that a femoral vein has a  \n \n          16    very -- quote, I believe this is a quote, has a very slight  \n \n          17    increased degree of reliability as opposed to peripheral IV  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 60of 124\n \n          18    access.  \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    So -- and you believe that peripheral IV access is  \n \n          21    also reliable? \n \n          22    A    Yes, but it is also deemed unreliable by some of your  \n \n          23    experts, so when one balances the benefits vs. the risks,  \n \n          24    the increased reliability of a femoral venous catheter is  \n \n          25    worth considering based upon some of the statements that  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             325 \n \n \n \n           1    your own experts have made. \n \n           2    Q    If a peripheral IV were placed by a board-certified  \n \n           3    surgeon, do you believe it would be reliable? \n \n           4    A    I think an IV placed by anybody with any significant  \n \n           5    amount of experience is probably reliable. \n \n           6    Q    So if both types of IV access are medically reliable  \n \n           7    in your view, what are the medical indications for using  \n \n           8    femoral access? \n \n           9    A    Well, in my experience when I use a femoral IV it's  \n \n          10    typically because either we do not have access to the upper  \n \n          11    extremities or the neck because of the nature of the  \n \n          12    patient's condition, or, for example, in certain trauma  \n \n          13    patients we want to have a reliable IV below the diaphragm  \n \n          14    as well as having reliable IV access above the diaphragm. \n \n          15    Q    So is it fair to say you don't routinely use femoral  \n \n          16    catheterization as your first choice method in inducing  \n \n          17    anesthesia?  \n \n          18    A    Well, it depends on the nature of the patient.  With  \n \n          19    certain trauma patients it's definitely our first choice  \n \n          20    for IV catheterization.  But I will tell you that's a small  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 61of 124\n \n          21    fraction of the over-all population.  But depending on the  \n \n          22    person's presentation, the femoral IV catheter might very  \n \n          23    well be the preferred and initial site for IV placement. \n \n          24    Q    So whether the femoral IV is the preferred initial  \n \n          25    site for placement depends on the patient; is that correct? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             326 \n \n \n \n           1    A    In a clinical scenario, that's my experience. \n \n           2    Q    How many femoral venous catheters have you placed in  \n \n           3    the last year? \n \n           4    A    I have no idea.  I don't keep track of these things. \n \n           5    Q    Do you know how many you placed in the last month? \n \n           6    A    No. \n \n           7    Q    Can you estimate? \n \n           8    A    No.  It's -- it's not something that I keep track of,  \n \n           9    nor could I tell you how many Big Macs I ate in the last  \n \n          10    month.  They have about the same level of importance to me. \n \n          11    Q    Would you say that you put in femoral lines  \n \n          12    frequently? \n \n          13    A    I guess it depends on your definition of frequently.   \n \n          14    I work in a major trauma center so it happens.  Sometimes  \n \n          15    the surgeons or emergency department surgeons or emergency  \n \n          16    department doctors get to the patient before the anesthesia  \n \n          17    team and they may have secured the femoral line before I  \n \n          18    do, or my team does.  But it's certainly something that we  \n \n          19    use with some regularity. \n \n          20    Q    I see.  With some regularity.  So would you be  \n \n          21    surprised if I told you that somebody who performs femoral  \n \n          22    catheterization all the time, thousands of times in their  \n \n          23    career, sees a 10 to 20 percent over-all complication rate  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 62of 124\n \n          24    in their clinical practice? \n \n          25    A    I think it's very important that, first of all, one  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             327 \n \n \n \n           1    define complication and one also define the purpose for  \n \n           2    which the catheter is inserted.  I can certainly tell you  \n \n           3    that when femoral catheters are put in long-term for  \n \n           4    dialysis patients, nobody would agree that there's a 20  \n \n           5    percent incidence of complications, because it just doesn't  \n \n           6    happen.   \n \n           7    Q    And if an artery were punctured in the course of  \n \n           8    femoral catheterization, would the hematoma be bigger than  \n \n           9    just a venous puncture? \n \n          10    A    Assuming that the hole was the same size in the  \n \n          11    arterial venous puncture, more blood would leak out through  \n \n          12    the artery until tamponade is achieved than from a vein \n \n          13    because the pressure is higher. \n \n          14    Q    I see.  And I believe you testified that the  \n \n          15    appropriate treatment is to use pressure to stop the  \n \n          16    bleeding? \n \n          17    A    Yes. \n \n          18    Q    So you would disagree that the appropriate treatment  \n \n          19    from an arterial puncture is to allow the -- allow the  \n \n          20    puncture to bleed until the blood is naturally stopped by  \n \n          21    the pressure? \n \n          22    A    First of all, I would apply pressure and between  \n \n          23    pressure and the blood's normal clotting ability, the hole  \n \n          24    generally seals in a matter of seconds, or a minute or  \n \n          25    two.  Also, again, dependent upon the size of the hole,   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             328 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 63of 124\n \n \n \n           1    there may be continued leakage.  Sometimes it's  \n \n           2    imperceptible to the person standing there whether or not  \n \n           3    there's continued leakage, and it typically does end up  \n \n           4    sealing itself after a period of time due to the tamponade  \n \n           5    effect. \n \n           6    Q    About how much blood would be -- do you have any idea  \n \n           7    about how much blood would come out before it sealed  \n \n           8    itself? \n \n           9    A    It depends on so many variables - the site, the exact  \n \n          10    site at which it's punctured and the physical make-up of  \n \n          11    the patient - that I cannot even begin to estimate how much  \n \n          12    blood could be present in a hematoma there. \n \n          13    Q    So you have no way of knowing in the abstract how  \n \n          14    serious that kind of hematoma would be? \n \n          15    A    Certainly it depends on your definition of serious.   \n \n          16    If you define serious as life-threatening, that's very  \n \n          17    difficult to imagine. \n \n          18    Q    So you have no way -- then let me rephrase.  You have  \n \n          19    no way of knowing how painful a hematoma might be from an  \n \n          20    arterial puncture, in the abstract? \n \n          21    A    Well, if I was concerned that the person were in pain  \n \n          22    I would ask. \n \n          23    Q    Are some people relatively resistant to the effects of  \n \n          24    thiopental? \n \n          25    A    There are some people who require slightly greater  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             329 \n \n \n \n           1    doses than others and the most common reason would be the  \n \n           2    co-administration of concurrent medications or the frequent  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 64of 124\n \n           3    ingestion of alcohol. \n \n           4    Q    So does that relative resistance have anything to do  \n \n           5    with metabolizing thiopental? \n \n           6    A    No, because in the context of a judicial execution,  \n \n           7    which takes a few minutes, metabolism is a completely  \n \n           8    unimportant and irrelevant paramater.  \n \n           9    Q    So if I told you that John Doe One stated in his  \n \n          10    deposition, Page 27, quote:  \"The extra gram\" -- or \"One  \n \n          11    gram of thiopental will cause 90 percent of the population  \n \n          12    to be unconscious.  The extra gram is for that small  \n \n          13    percentage of drug addicts that had excessive drug use.   \n \n          14    They produce enzymes in the liver that allows them to \n \n          15    metabolize pentothal at a much more rapid rate,\" would you  \n \n          16    agree or disagree with that statement?  \n \n          17    A    Well, it depends upon two things.  First of all, it  \n \n          18    assumes that the person has been recently and regularly  \n \n          19    using drugs, and second of all, it assumes that their abuse  \n \n          20    drug is something that does produce liver enzymes.  But if  \n \n          21    both of those things were true, then that's a true  \n \n          22    statement.   \n \n          23    Q    But I believe you just said before that metabolism of  \n \n          24    pentothal is not a relevant factor in determining  \n \n          25    consciousness.  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             330 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Metabolism per se does not affect the probability of  \n \n           2    consciousness or the time to awakening when large doses of  \n \n           3    thiopental are used in a judicial execution.  \n \n           4    Q    Is thiopental best described as a sedative or an  \n \n           5    anesthetic? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 65of 124\n \n           6    A    Pharmacologically we describe it as a sedative  \n \n           7    hypnotic drug meaning that at low doses it produces  \n \n           8    sedation and at high doses it produces hypnosis.  Now, to a  \n \n           9    pharmacologist, hypnosis means loss of consciousness.  It  \n \n          10    has nothing to do with what they do in nightclubs.  It's a  \n \n          11    pharmacological term meaning loss of consciousness.  \n \n          12    Q    So at high doses thiopental has hypnotic properties?  \n \n          13    A    No.  In the context of producing unconsciousness it  \n \n          14    can produce an anesthetic state.   \n \n          15    Q    So you disagree with the statement that thiopental has \n \n          16    no anesthetic properties whatsoever? \n \n          17    A    I think that that is misstated as far as being  \n \n          18    linguistically correct. \n \n          19    Q    So if I told you that John Doe One stated that, you  \n \n          20    would feel that was incorrect? \n \n          21    A    Well, I read his deposition and I disagree with that  \n \n          22    statement. \n \n          23              MS. ANDERS:  If I could have a moment, Your  \n \n          24    Honor. \n \n          25    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Is mixing the thiopental difficult? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             331 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    And I think you actually testified that it was not  \n \n           3    difficult; is that correct? \n \n           4    A    That's correct. \n \n           5    Q    So if I told you that John Doe One stated, \"I am the  \n \n           6    one that always mixes the pentothal because it's very  \n \n           7    difficult for someone who is not used to this to accomplish  \n \n           8    it.\"  You disagree with that statement? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 66of 124\n \n           9    A    I think it depends upon a person's background and  \n \n          10    training, but certainly most people who are intelligent can  \n \n          11    be taught to mix up a drug like thiopental properly.  It's  \n \n          12    not intuitively obvious how to do it when you're handed the  \n \n          13    materials, but I don't think training somebody to do it is  \n \n          14    difficult. \n \n          15    Q    And you think a board-certified surgeon would have the  \n \n          16    expertise to mix thiopental properly? \n \n          17    A    I would hope so. \n \n          18    Q    Does propofol have to be administered through a  \n \n          19    continuous infusion? \n \n          20    A    Propofol?  We are switching to propofol now? \n \n          21    Q    Just a question. \n \n          22    A    I just want to make sure.  Propofol can be given by  \n \n          23    bolus or by infusion, either way. \n \n          24    Q    So you disagree with the statement that it requires a  \n \n          25    continuous IV infusion? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             332 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I think in that context, propofol is much shorter  \n \n           2    acting than thiopental, so if one wants a prolonged effect  \n \n           3    one would give repeated boluses or a continuous infusion  \n \n           4    for a prolonged effect. \n \n           5    Q    Thank you. \n \n           6              MS.

PRITCHETT:  \n \n           8    Q    Early in the cross-examination you were asked whether  \n \n           9    or not the amount of the thiopental that was given in the  \n \n          10    last few executions was what you presumed it to be in your  \n \n          11    modeling, your charts, when you testified in January. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 67of 124\n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    And I believe you indicated that the dose of  \n \n          14    thiopental that was actually given was less, 2.5 instead of  \n \n          15    five grams.  \n \n          16    A    Yes. \n \n          17    Q    And I believe you also testified that the amount of  \n \n          18    the diluent was different than what you had assumed in  \n \n          19    making your initial analysis in this case that you provided  \n \n          20    testimony on in January. \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    And the amount of diluent was reduced to less than  \n \n          23    what you had assumed back in January. \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    And the rate of administration was also different than  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             333 \n \n \n \n           1    what you had assumed in your initial analysis; is that  \n \n           2    correct? \n \n           3    A    Yes. \n \n           4    Q    And the rate of administration was greater than what  \n \n           5    you had thought. \n \n           6    A    Yes, the time to complete the administration was less. \n \n           7    Q    Despite all those differences, the decrease in the  \n \n           8    thiopental, the decrease in the diluent, the increase in  \n \n           9    the administration rate of the drug, does that have any  \n \n          10    meaningful -- does that make any meaningful difference in  \n \n          11    your conclusions that you testified to in January? \n \n          12    A    No, because these changes result in changes in  \n \n          13    probabilities of consciousness that are extremely tiny to  \n \n          14    begin with, and if we change one very tiny number to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 68of 124\n \n          15    another very tiny number, in my opinion it makes no  \n \n          16    meaningful scientific difference in whether or not the  \n \n          17    execution meets what most people would consider the  \n \n          18    definition of humaneness, meaning a very high probability  \n \n          19    of unconsciousness. \n \n          20    Q    Did I hear you testify as part of the  \n \n          21    cross-examination that you saw no clinical difference  \n \n          22    between the use of the execution process in Missouri and  \n \n          23    that that was used in North Carolina in the recent  \n \n          24    execution with the BIS machine? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  Missouri has recently used 2.5 grams, which is  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             334 \n \n \n \n           1    slightly different from the three grams that they use in  \n \n           2    North Carolina, and the time to administer may be a little  \n \n           3    different.  In Missouri the 2.5 grams is dissolved in a  \n \n           4    much lower volume of diluent than they use in North  \n \n           5    Carolina.  However, in North Carolina the three grams,  \n \n           6    although it is dissolved in the usual clinical  \n \n           7    concentration, result in a much larger volume.  And the  \n \n           8    way that it's administered in North Carolina is to have  \n \n           9    two executioners each with a syringe each injecting  \n \n          10    simultaneously into an IV so that the overall speed of  \n \n          11    completing the injection does not seem to be different by  \n \n          12    more than a few seconds at most between North Carolina and  \n \n          13    Missouri, as far as I can tell. \n \n          14    Q    You were also asked in cross-examination whether you  \n \n          15    were -- and I think this is close to a quote -- certain  \n \n          16    that Dr. Henthorn's analysis was wrong. \n \n          17    A    I think that his analysis -- \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 69of 124\n \n          18    Q    Before you -- does that pretty adequately, accurately,  \n \n          19    summarize your testimony? \n \n          20    A    I am certain that there is an assumption on which his  \n \n          21    analysis is based that is flawed. \n \n          22              MR. PRITCHETT:  Judge, I know you sustained the  \n \n          23    objection to the discussion of what that assumption was in  \n \n          24    the direct portion of the testimony.  I think the door has  \n \n          25    been open now and I would ask the opportunity to explore  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             335 \n \n \n \n           1    that with the witness. \n \n           2              MS.

We haven't had  \n \n           4    a chance to ask our expert about it, and we haven't been  \n \n           5    able to depose Dr. Dershwitz on his views. \n \n           6              THE COURT:  I don't see that the  \n \n           7    cross-examination put that in any better posture, so  \n \n           8    objection is overruled -- or sustained rather.   \n \n           9    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  You were also asked towards the  \n \n          10    end of your cross-examination about Dr. Doe's testimony  \n \n          11    that thiopental is not an anesthetic, and you disagreed as  \n \n          12    a general matter with that conclusion. \n \n          13    A    Yes. \n \n          14    Q    Does that clinical either difference of opinion or  \n \n          15    mistake, however it should be described, does that have a  \n \n          16    clinical -- does that make a clinical difference in this  \n \n          17    case? \n \n          18    A    Well, in my opinion as long as Dr. Doe succeeds in  \n \n          19    properly providing an adequate dose, which is, in my  \n \n          20    opinion, at least 1.5 to two grams of the thiopental,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 70of 124\n \n          21    properly delivered to the IV, it will have no meaningful  \n \n          22    effect on the conduct of a judicial execution.  And so the  \n \n          23    fact that he made some pharmacological mistakes in his  \n \n          24    deposition does not contradict his statements about how  \n \n          25    much thiopental he says he gave, and the amount that he  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             336 \n \n \n \n           1    said he gave was adequate to conduct a humane execution. \n \n           2    Q    And then I think very nearly at the close of your  \n \n           3    cross-examination you were asked about how difficult it is  \n \n           4    to mix thiopental, and we understand that it is a fairly  \n \n           5    simple process.  What's your understanding, if you have  \n \n           6    one, of why Dr. Doe was having difficulty with mixing the  \n \n           7    thiopental in the execution context? \n \n           8    A    My understanding from his deposition is that when  \n \n           9    Missouri formerly used a five-gram single dose container of  \n \n          10    thiopental, he was able to dissolve that five grams of  \n \n          11    thiopental in an amount of diluent that would fit in a  \n \n          12    60 millimeter syringe.   \n \n          13              Subsequently, the State has procured the  \n \n          14    thiopental as 500 milligram injection kits, which is  \n \n          15    actually the standard preparation that we use at my  \n \n          16    hospital, and he then said that he was unable to put five  \n \n          17    grams in 60 milliliters of diluent.  I think there's two  \n \n          18    possible explanations that make pharmacological sense about  \n \n          19    why this difference may have occurred.  First of all, we  \n \n          20    know that thiopental is more soluable in water than it is  \n \n          21    in saline so one possibility is the preparation that was  \n \n          22    formerly used came with water as the diluent and the  \n \n          23    current preparation could have saline as the diluent  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 71of 124\n \n          24    because depending on the manufacturer from which the  \n \n          25    thiopental is procured some use water and some use saline.   \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             337 \n \n \n \n           1    So that is a systematic change that may have occurred,  \n \n           2    although I can't say that for certain, but it is a  \n \n           3    possibility.   \n \n           4              The other possibility is because the manufacturer  \n \n           5    intends that the medication be prepared as a 2.5 percent  \n \n           6    solution, there's no reason for them to make any  \n \n           7    manufacturing efforts to make it soluable at a higher  \n \n           8    concentration.  And so it is possible that from one  \n \n           9    manufacturer to the other the crystalline structure of the  \n \n          10    medication itself is such that it was not soluable at the  \n \n          11    higher concentration as compared to the lower  \n \n          12    concentration. \n \n          13              For example, thiopental is not soluable at  \n \n          14    neutral pH.  In order to get it into solution, the pH  \n \n          15    has to be elevated to approximately 11.  Now, if one  \n \n          16    manufacturer had it at 10 and a half and the other  \n \n          17    manufacturer had it at 11 and a half as buffered in the  \n \n          18    solid state, there would be an enormous difference in  \n \n          19    maximum solubility.  Yet, in both cases they meet FDA  \n \n          20    requirements for clinical use of 2.5 percent.  So it's  \n \n          21    not the least bit surprising to me that there were  \n \n          22    differences in the behavior of batches from different  \n \n          23    manufacturers. \n \n          24              MR.

ANDERS: \n \n           2    Q    How much training did you undergo to become an  \n \n           3    anesthesiologist? \n \n           4    A    Well, if one starts with college, I have a degree in  \n \n           5    chemistry which most medical students have a bachelor's  \n \n           6    degree before entering medical school.  Then I did four  \n \n           7    years of medical school.  And then an internship, two years  \n \n           8    of residency, and a two-year research fellowship.  In  \n \n           9    addition, I also have a Ph.D in pharmacology which has been  \n \n          10    very useful to me as an anesthesiologist, which took an  \n \n          11    additional four and a half to five years. \n \n          12    Q    So would you say that inducing anesthesia, general  \n \n          13    anesthesia, is a complex process? \n \n          14    A    Inducing general anesthesia is actually pretty easy. \n \n          15    Q    So it's really not necessary to have all that  \n \n          16    training? \n \n          17    A    Well, it depends on the scenario.  What's hard is to  \n \n          18    wake the patient up.  But putting people to sleep, I'm not  \n \n          19    trying to be facetious, putting people to sleep is actually  \n \n          20    relatively easy.  Keeping them stable and alive and waking  \n \n          21    them up again is the hard part. \n \n          22    Q    Is monitoring the anesthetic depth of a paralyzed  \n \n          23    patient, is that complex? \n \n          24    A    Clinically that could be very complex.  That's one of  \n \n          25    the reasons why some of the new monitors have become very  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             339 \n \n \n \n           1    helpful to some of us. \n \n           2    Q    Are you aware of whether John Doe One uses the diluent  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 73of 124\n \n           3    in the package that comes from the manufacturer? \n \n           4    A    I'm assuming he does, because there's no description  \n \n           5    that he acquires a diluent from another source. \n \n           6    Q    But you don't know for sure; is that correct? \n \n           7    A    Well, again, he describes using what's in the kit and  \n \n           8    the kit in which the 500 milligram dose comes, he describes  \n \n           9    having two separate containers, one container with powder  \n \n          10    and one container with diluent and he's mixing them  \n \n          11    together, so I have to conclude that he's using the diluent  \n \n          12    that comes in the kit.  And as I said, depending on which  \n \n          13    manufacturer supplies the medication, some manufacturers  \n \n          14    use water and some manufacturers use saline. \n \n          15    Q    And you can't say for sure why the thiopental didn't  \n \n          16    dissolve; is that correct?  I understand that you gave a  \n \n          17    couple of possibilities, but -- \n \n          18    A    I can't say for sure which of the two examples was  \n \n          19    more important.  It's possible that both were operative,  \n \n          20    but I don't know for sure. \n \n          21              MS. ANDERS:  Nothing further, Your Honor. \n \n          22              MR.

The physician.  What's your  \n \n          21    understanding as to the amount of the drug that was  \n \n          22    administered in the last several executions? \n \n          23    A    2.5 grams. \n \n          24    Q    As far as you know, did the doctor act on his own, at  \n \n          25    his own discretion, in reducing the dosage? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             342 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, sir, that is correct. \n \n           2    Q    What's your understanding as to why the doctor thought  \n \n           3    he had the authority to alter the dose on his own? \n \n           4    A    Well, he's been involved in the execution process with  \n \n           5    the state of Missouri for many years and it's my  \n \n           6    understanding that he thought that based upon his medical  \n \n           7    knowledge that he had the duty and responsibility to make a  \n \n           8    decision based upon the goals of the Department of  \n \n           9    Corrections to do an execution that is quick and as humane  \n \n          10    as possible. \n \n          11    Q    Had the doctor been involved in the execution process  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 76of 124\n \n          12    in the state of Missouri for some time? \n \n          13    A    Yes, sir, he has been. \n \n          14    Q    And had his recommendations, his thoughts as to how  \n \n          15    the process should work, have they been relied upon by the  \n \n          16    Department over the course of time, as you understand it? \n \n          17    A    Yes, they have been.   \n \n          18    Q    Now that we have learned that, in the last several  \n \n          19    executions, there was a 2.5 gram dose as opposed to a five  \n \n          20    gram dose of sodium pentothal used, what's your view as to  \n \n          21    that situation? \n \n          22    A    Well, it should never have occurred and I hate that it  \n \n          23    did, but I can understand why the doctor made the decisions  \n \n          24    that he made, once again, based upon his medical knowledge,  \n \n          25    his involvement in the process, and also him wanting to  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             343 \n \n \n \n           1    make sure that the Department of Corrections completed  \n \n           2    their goal.  And I think that the 2.5 was adequate in being  \n \n           3    administered and to keep the offender sedated and  \n \n           4    unconscious during the process and that the ones that I  \n \n           5    have been involved with, they have gone very smooth. \n \n           6    Q    Are you aware of any changes that are planned by the  \n \n           7    Department of Corrections to firm up the procedure and to  \n \n           8    ensure that proposed modifications in the procedure are  \n \n           9    referred to the director, for the director's decision? \n \n          10    A    Yes, sir, I am. \n \n          11    Q    As general matter, what is planned by the Department  \n \n          12    of Corrections in this regard to firm up the process? \n \n          13    A    To come out with a more detailed, more direct policy  \n \n          14    and procedures dealing with the execution process that will  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 77of 124\n \n          15    delineate the amount of dosage that are supposed to be  \n \n          16    used, the sequence in which they are to be given, and that  \n \n          17    any changes that are to be made are to be in the sequenced  \n \n          18    amount and so forth and will be approved by the Department  \n \n          19    of Corrections before they're done. \n \n          20    Q    Does that document, directive, policy, whatever you  \n \n          21    want to call it, has that been drafted as of this time? \n \n          22    A    No, sir, it has not. \n \n          23    Q    Have certain determinations been made as to what the  \n \n          24    contents of that directive will contain? \n \n          25    A    Some of them have, yes, sir. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             344 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And -- \n \n           2              THE COURT:  Why is all of this relevant to this  \n \n           3    procedure, Mr. Pritchett?  \n \n           4              MR. PRITCHETT:  Judge, I think it's relevant to  \n \n           5    show the court that we understand that there was a  \n \n           6    deviation, an aberration from the process as described  \n \n           7    before, and actions are being taken so that it doesn't  \n \n           8    happen again, so that the Department of Corrections can be  \n \n           9    confident that the process will be as described. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  Okay.  I still don't think it's  \n \n          11    relevant, because it's in court now, that issue is going to  \n \n          12    be ultimately decided by this court and this court is  \n \n          13    probably going to fashion something, if it deems it  \n \n          14    appropriate, that may or may not be consistent with the  \n \n          15    Department of Corrections, and at some point in time if  \n \n          16    that occurs the court will have to look at what the  \n \n          17    Department does.  But in terms of what it's doing now,  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 78of 124\n \n          18    other than what you have just stated, is not relevant to  \n \n          19    me.  But proceed. \n \n          20              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you, Judge. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  You have your time. \n \n          22              MR. PRITCHETT:  And I really do not intend to  \n \n          23    belabor the point.  I just wanted to get the expectations  \n \n          24    out into the record and in front of you, and in the spirit  \n \n          25    of not belaboring it I think we'll talk about the details  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             345 \n \n \n \n           1    of the process with the director in his testimony.   \n \n           2    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  Are there also plans under way,  \n \n           3    though, to attempt to ensure that the requirements of any  \n \n           4    policy that is developed will actually be carried out? \n \n           5    A    Yes, sir, there is. \n \n           6    Q    And what are those? \n \n           7    A    Each one of the individuals that's involved in the  \n \n           8    process will have consultation, go through the policy, and  \n \n           9    once the policy is over with, we'll have a -- kind of like  \n \n          10    a debriefing, auditing team, and then we'll go back through  \n \n          11    to make sure everything was done the way it was supposed to  \n \n          12    be done, that procedures were followed. \n \n          13    Q    And will emphasis be placed on what decisions are  \n \n          14    matters that have to be referred to the director and what  \n \n          15    decisions are matters of discretion to certain individuals? \n \n          16    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          17    Q    Do you have knowledge as to the lighting as it exists  \n \n          18    in the execution support room, the room where the persons,  \n \n          19    the doctor, the nurse and John Doe stand? \n \n          20    A    Yes, sir. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 79of 124\n \n          21    Q    Before the execution is actually under way, what is  \n \n          22    your understanding as to the lighting in that room? \n \n          23    A    All of the lights are on and it's very bright. \n \n          24    Q    Are the drugs prepared while the lights are on and  \n \n          25    sufficiently bright to be able to see? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             346 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, sir, they are.  About one hour before the  \n \n           2    execution is scheduled. \n \n           3    Q    Okay.  Are the drugs then -- the syringes laid out in  \n \n           4    any particular manner? \n \n           5    A    Yes, sir, they are. \n \n           6    Q    And what manner is that? \n \n           7    A    They are laid out in the sequence in which they will  \n \n           8    be administered. \n \n           9    Q    When it's time to begin administration of the drugs,  \n \n          10    is there a change in the lighting in the execution support  \n \n          11    room? \n \n          12    A    Yes, sir, there is.  It is decreased. \n \n          13    Q    Do you know why that is? \n \n          14    A    It is to ensure that the reflective window operates  \n \n          15    properly. \n \n          16    Q    Is there -- is it dark?  Is it too dark to be able to  \n \n          17    see the medications, the drugs that have been laid out at  \n \n          18    that time? \n \n          19    A    It is dark, but they can still read the names on the  \n \n          20    syringes, the names that have been printed on the syringes. \n \n          21    Q    Is it sufficient to do the work of the persons that  \n \n          22    are administering the drugs? \n \n          23    A    Yes, sir, it is. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 80of 124\n \n          24              THE COURT:  Are you back there when this is  \n \n          25    happening, Mr. Moore? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             347 \n \n \n \n           1              THE WITNESS:  No, sir, I'm not. \n \n           2    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  There's also been some reference  \n \n           3    to the experience level of particularly John Doe Three and  \n \n           4    John Doe Five.  Are John Doe Three and John Doe Five  \n \n           5    particular individuals, or is this a designation for some  \n \n           6    class of duty within the prison? \n \n           7    A    They are particular individuals. \n \n           8    Q    Does John Doe Three have experience in the  \n \n           9    administration of the lethal drugs? \n \n          10    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          11    Q    Can you tell us what that experience is? \n \n          12    A    I don't know the exact number but many, many, many  \n \n          13    executions, for several years. \n \n          14    Q    So he's been involved in the process as a participant  \n \n          15    for some time? \n \n          16    A    That is correct. \n \n          17    Q    And are you aware of John Doe Five's level of  \n \n          18    experience? \n \n          19    A    John Doe Five has been involved in at least the last  \n \n          20    five. \n \n          21    Q    And has he taken part in the process with John Doe  \n \n          22    Three? \n \n          23    A    That is correct, yes, sir. \n \n          24    Q    And is John Doe One, the doctor, also present at the  \n \n          25    time? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             348 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 81of 124\n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes, sir. \n \n           2    Q    And is it your understanding that before John Doe Five  \n \n           3    actually took part in an execution there was some practice  \n \n           4    in the process? \n \n           5    A    Yes, sir.   \n \n           6              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you.  That's all I have,  \n \n           7    Mr. Moore.   \n \n           8    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BERGER:  \n \n           9    Q    Good afternoon, Mr. Moore.  \n \n          10    A    Good morning. \n \n          11    Q    You said in prior testimony in this case that Missouri  \n \n          12    injected five grams of thiopental, right? \n \n          13    A    That is correct, yes, sir. \n \n          14    Q    And you believed this to be true at the time you said  \n \n          15    it, didn't you? \n \n          16    A    Yes, sir, I did. \n \n          17    Q    But that's not what happened, is it? \n \n          18    A    From the records and from what I have been told, no,  \n \n          19    that did not occur.  Not in the last four I think it is. \n \n          20    Q    But you don't mix the thiopental, do you? \n \n          21    A    No, sir, I do not. \n \n          22    Q    So at the time you testified in January you couldn't  \n \n          23    have known that five grams weren't going to be used, could  \n \n          24    you have? \n \n          25    A    No, but I think if you look at my testimony I think I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             349 \n \n \n \n           1    said to the best of my knowledge, because I think Mr. Simon  \n \n           2    even asked me the question about what do you mean by the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 82of 124\n \n           3    best of your knowledge, and I had to explain where my  \n \n           4    knowledge came from. \n \n           5    Q    But so based on your level of knowledge, it wasn't  \n \n           6    your fault that the wrong amount was stated.  \n \n           7    A    No, sir, it was not. \n \n           8    Q    You mentioned a moment ago the goals of the execution  \n \n           9    procedure.  What are those goals? \n \n          10    A    It's basically to ensure that a humane and quick  \n \n          11    execution occurs once the order has been issued by the  \n \n          12    Missouri Supreme Court. \n \n          13    Q    And how do you prioritize those goals? \n \n          14    A    I don't know that it's necessarily prioritized as  \n \n          15    quick or humane either way. \n \n          16    Q    If there were to be a difference between carrying out  \n \n          17    a quick execution and an humane execution, would you assign  \n \n          18    different levels of priority to those competing goals in  \n \n          19    the event that they were to diverge? \n \n          20    A    Humane. \n \n          21    Q    Are these goals recorded anywhere? \n \n          22    A    Not that I'm aware of. \n \n          23    Q    Have you discussed these goals with John Doe One? \n \n          24    A    I personally have not, no, sir. \n \n          25    Q    Your position is the director of Adult Institutions;  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             350 \n \n \n \n           1    is that correct? \n \n           2    A    Yes, sir. \n \n           3    Q    And part of your responsibility is to oversee the  \n \n           4    execution procedures, right? \n \n           5    A    It is in one of the institutions in which I'm the  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 83of 124\n \n           6    director of the superintendent of that particular  \n \n           7    institution.

Thank you, Your Honor. \n \n           5    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Isn't it true, Mr. Moore, that you  \n \n           6    need to rely on John Doe One to mix the chemicals properly? \n \n           7    A    John Doe One and then also the nurse. \n \n           8    Q    Can the nurse tell John Doe One what to do? \n \n           9    A    The nurse can offer an opinion, make suggestions. \n \n          10    Q    Is your understanding -- based on your understanding,  \n \n          11    who is in charge of the mixing process? \n \n          12    A    The doctor. \n \n          13    Q    And based on your understanding, who has made the  \n \n          14    decisions about dosage, particularly on the evenings when  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 86of 124\n \n          15    there has been some difficulty mixing the thiopental? \n \n          16    A    The doctor. \n \n          17    Q    And you rely on John Doe One for all the other medical  \n \n          18    decisions that need to be made with the timing of the  \n \n          19    executions and the placement of the femoral line and so on;  \n \n          20    is that correct? \n \n          21    A    Once again, John Doe One and the nurse. \n \n          22    Q    And you have testified that you rely on John Doe One's  \n \n          23    representation as to whether the EKG machine is set, right? \n \n          24    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          25    Q    Do you accept the proposition that the safety of a  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             354 \n \n \n \n           1    given medical procedure depends on the manner in which it  \n \n           2    is undertaken? \n \n           3    A    Yes, sir. \n \n           4    Q    Do you accept the proposition that the safety of a  \n \n           5    given medical procedure depends on the qualifications and  \n \n           6    judgments of the person or persons administering it? \n \n           7    A    Education and training, yes, sir. \n \n           8    Q    Did John Doe One ever tell you, prior to your  \n \n           9    testimony, that he was giving less than five grams? \n \n          10    A    No, sir, he did not. \n \n          11    Q    Did he ever tell you he was having trouble mixing the  \n \n          12    thiopental? \n \n          13    A    No, sir, he did not. \n \n          14    Q    Did he ever tell you that he was dyslexic and had  \n \n          15    difficulty with numbers? \n \n          16    A    No, sir, he did not. \n \n          17    Q    Did he ever give you an opinion on the relative  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 87of 124\n \n          18    advantages of femoral access as compared with peripheral  \n \n          19    access? \n \n          20    A    We did have an overall broad discussion about that  \n \n          21    topic. \n \n          22    Q    What did he say? \n \n          23    A    The emphasis was that the flow of the drugs would go  \n \n          24    better through the femoral vein catheter than if it was a  \n \n          25    peripheral. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             355 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Did you talk about how much pain each of the two  \n \n           2    procedures would have relative to each other? \n \n           3    A    No, sir, we did not. \n \n           4    Q    Did you talk about the possible medical complications  \n \n           5    that could arise with each procedure? \n \n           6    A    No, sir. \n \n           7    Q    Did you talk about anything else other than the flow  \n \n           8    of drugs? \n \n           9    A    Not that I recall, no, sir. \n \n          10    Q    On -- \n \n          11              THE COURT:  Mr. Berger -- when did you have this  \n \n          12    discussion, Mr. Moore, with John Doe One? \n \n          13              THE WITNESS:  It was at one of the executions.   \n \n          14    Probably October 2005. \n \n          15              THE COURT:  Excuse me. \n \n          16              MR. BERGER:  Thank you, Your Honor. \n \n          17    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  On page 89 of his deposition  \n \n          18    transcript John Doe One says medical errors are committed  \n \n          19    by someone performing a procedure for the first time.  Does  \n \n          20    this sound right to you?  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 88of 124\n \n          21    A    I would say there is a possibility of that, yes, sir. \n \n          22    Q    So to the extent -- John Doe One also says that any  \n \n          23    doctor who has performed any procedure more than ten times  \n \n          24    will never make in a error.  Does this seem right to you? \n \n          25    A    Will never make an error? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             356 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Yes, Mr. Moore. \n \n           2    A    No, sir, that does not seem correct. \n \n           3    Q    In your judgment, do you feel comfortable employing or  \n \n           4    contracting with someone to take part in medicalized  \n \n           5    procedures who believes this to be the case? \n \n           6    A    I have confidence in his capabilities. \n \n           7    Q    Would it change your mind to find out that his view on  \n \n           8    that and many other significant issues connected with this  \n \n           9    procedure were widely rejected by many or most doctors? \n \n          10    A    I would say that it's something that we definitely  \n \n          11    need to have a detailed, thorough discussion about. \n \n          12    Q    Would a statement like the one I just quoted to you  \n \n          13    raise questions in your mind about John Doe One's judgment? \n \n          14    A    No, sir. \n \n          15    Q    Have you spoken with John Doe One over the past few  \n \n          16    weeks during this litigation about his continued  \n \n          17    participation in executions in Missouri? \n \n          18    A    No, sir, I have not. \n \n          19    Q    At page 62 of his deposition transcript, John Doe One  \n \n          20    discussed his authority vis-a-vis the director of prisons.   \n \n          21    He said, \"He's relying on me to keep him looking good.\"  Do  \n \n          22    you think the inconsistencies in dosage reflect well on \n \n          23    Missouri's Department of Corrections? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 89of 124\n \n          24    A    I don't know what he's referring to when he says to  \n \n          25    keep him looking good.  If I knew what the context of his  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             357 \n \n \n \n           1    statement was, then -- \n \n           2    Q    If he were to mean that part of the doctor's role in  \n \n           3    this process is to help things go smoothly so that the  \n \n           4    Department looks good and it looks like they're carrying  \n \n           5    these things out in a systematic manner and in a way to  \n \n           6    ensure a painless, humane death, do you think that the  \n \n           7    inconsistencies reflect well on the Department of  \n \n           8    Corrections? \n \n           9    A    It does not reflect well, and once again, you know,  \n \n          10    I'm sorry that it happened, but we need to ensure that it  \n \n          11    doesn't happen again, and that's the reason we're in the  \n \n          12    process of formulating additional new policies. \n \n          13    Q    As you formulate those additional policies, will you  \n \n          14    be in touch with John Doe One? \n \n          15    A    Yes, we will. \n \n          16    Q    Based on what's happened already and what has been  \n \n          17    said in this litigation, do you have confidence in John Doe  \n \n          18    One's competence to carry out executions in Missouri? \n \n          19    A    Yes, I do. \n \n          20    Q    So you intend to continue to allow John Doe One to  \n \n          21    keep his position in the execution procedure; is that  \n \n          22    correct? \n \n          23    A    I won't be the final authority to make that decision. \n \n          24    Q    What factors -- will you play a role in that decision? \n \n          25    A    Yes, sir, I will. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             358 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 90of 124\n \n \n \n           1    Q    What are the factors that you would weigh in that  \n \n           2    decision? \n \n           3    A    Advice from other medical experts, what direction we  \n \n           4    get from the courts. \n \n           5    Q    Have you been in touch with other medical experts? \n \n           6    A    Other than reading some of the information that has  \n \n           7    come across to me as a result of this particular case, no,  \n \n           8    I have not. \n \n           9    Q    Do you intend to get in touch with other medical  \n \n          10    experts about John Doe One's competence and professional  \n \n          11    judgment? \n \n          12    A    We will have an over-all staff team meeting of those  \n \n          13    people who are currently involved in the process, the top  \n \n          14    managers of the Department of Corrections, and we will lay  \n \n          15    out a strategy as to what we are going to do from this  \n \n          16    point forward. \n \n          17    Q    Would John Doe One be at that meeting? \n \n          18    A    John Doe One could be at some of the meetings. \n \n          19    Q    But you don't imagine he would be at all of them? \n \n          20    A    Depends on what the discussion is about. \n \n          21    Q    Would you have any other doctors at that meeting? \n \n          22    A    There could be. \n \n          23    Q    But there would not definitely be other doctors at  \n \n          24    that meeting? \n \n          25    A    We haven't laid out what our strategy is going to be. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             359 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    How could you assess John Doe One's competence in that  \n \n           2    meeting -- what would you rely -- strike that.  What would  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 91of 124\n \n           3    you rely on during that meeting to assess John Doe One's  \n \n           4    competence were there not other doctors in the room at the  \n \n           5    time? \n \n           6    A    I guess a lot of it just depends on the context of the  \n \n           7    meeting itself, what that particular meeting is about and  \n \n           8    what concerns that are raised about his competency, and at  \n \n           9    that point we would decide then whether to continue to have  \n \n          10    this particular physician or a particular discussion  \n \n          11    related to what needs to change. \n \n          12    Q    So that would be based -- \n \n          13              THE COURT:  Mr. Berger, how much more time are  \n \n          14    you going to take with this examination? \n \n          15              MR. BERGER:  Not much, Your Honor.  Perhaps five  \n \n          16    more minutes. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  You have three. \n \n          18              MR. BERGER:  Thank you, Your Honor. \n \n          19    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  So am I correct that would then be  \n \n          20    based certainly on the information that's come to light  \n \n          21    during the course of this litigation and possibly input  \n \n          22    from other doctors? \n \n          23    A    Yes, sir, that would be part of it. \n \n          24    Q    Was it frustrating to find out after the fact that you  \n \n          25    had misrepresented the dose to this court? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             360 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It was frustrating.  It was disappointing.  But here  \n \n           2    again, based upon the information that I had at the time I  \n \n           3    did not misrepresent myself to the court. \n \n           4    Q    And didn't you just testify that this should never  \n \n           5    have occurred? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 92of 124\n \n           6    A    This should never have occurred, being the doctor  \n \n           7    should not have reduced the amount of dosage without  \n \n           8    getting the authority to do that by the director of the  \n \n           9    Department of Corrections. \n \n          10    Q    But it's correct that -- isn't it true that John Doe  \n \n          11    One assisted with the writing of the interrogatories on  \n \n          12    which you base your view somewhat?  Let me rephrase that.   \n \n          13    It's correct that if you did continue to use John Doe One  \n \n          14    in executions, you would still be putting your trust in  \n \n          15    him; is that right? \n \n          16    A    That's correct. \n \n          17    Q    Would you feel comfortable that you could 100 percent  \n \n          18    guarantee that the procedure would be followed as you  \n \n          19    instruct? \n \n          20    A    Once we lay out the additional policies, have  \n \n          21    discussions with him, yes, sir. \n \n          22    Q    Wouldn't you have some lingering reservations about  \n \n          23    using him based on his misrepresentations? \n \n          24    A    No.  Once we lay out the policy and have a discussion  \n \n          25    with him. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             361 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Mr. Crawford is the director of the Department of  \n \n           2    Corrections; is that correct? \n \n           3    A    That's correct. \n \n           4    Q    And you say he's working on a directive ordering that  \n \n           5    five grams be administered and other things; is that  \n \n           6    correct? \n \n           7    A    That's correct. \n \n           8    Q    And you fully intend to comply with that directive to  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 93of 124\n \n           9    inject five grams; is that correct? \n \n          10    A    Yes, sir. \n \n          11    Q    So you wouldn't have any objection to this court  \n \n          12    entering an order requiring the state to, for instance,  \n \n          13    inject five grams, would you? \n \n          14              MR. PRITCHETT:  Objection, Your Honor.  I think  \n \n          15    it's in a way seeking a legal conclusion, and also  \n \n          16    infringing upon what the court chooses to do. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  Objection sustained.   \n \n          18              You have one minute to wrap it up.   \n \n          19              Thirty seconds. \n \n          20    Q    (By Mr. Berger)  Are still relying on the same people  \n \n          21    you did in January when you said that the amount of  \n \n          22    thiopental is now five grams?  \n \n          23    A    That is correct, with the addition of Dr. Dershwitz. \n \n          24              MR. BERGER:  No further questions. \n \n          25              Thank you, Your Honor. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             362 \n \n \n \n           1              Thank you, Mr. Moore.  \n \n           2              MR.

PRITCHETT:  Yes. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  Why don't we take a short lunch break  \n \n          11    and then finish up with Mr. Crawford. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 94of 124\n \n          12              MR. PRITCHETT:  I don't think he'll take much  \n \n          13    longer than Mr. Moore.  You have told me it's pretty much  \n \n          14    irrelevant to you what the plan is, but I'd like to get it  \n \n          15    in the record. \n \n          16              THE COURT:  I understand that, but I'm saying  \n \n          17    this is kind of after the fact now.  It's interesting to  \n \n          18    know that they're going to do something, but all the  \n \n          19    details of it doesn't do anything for me at this point. \n \n          20              MR. PRITCHETT:  Okay. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  Do you think he's going to be about  \n \n          22    15 minutes or so; is that what you're saying? \n \n          23              MR.

And I met with my executive-level staff as well as  \n \n          10    experienced folks that had been working in that execution  \n \n          11    process, and even went to the -- after we had met and  \n \n          12    talked about and I looked over some of the protocols, that  \n \n          13    we even traveled to Potosi at that time, is where we have a  \n \n          14    correctional institution and I took a walk-through, a tour  \n \n          15    of the process at Potosi. \n \n          16    Q    Did you take into consideration advice that you  \n \n          17    received from your executive staff in reaching decisions  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 96of 124\n \n          18    with regard to the lethal injection process? \n \n          19    A    I do -- I do with that as well as most other  \n \n          20    decision-making.  It's a large Department.  We have over  \n \n          21    10,000 employees, and there's a lot of expertise within the  \n \n          22    Department and there's a lot of specialized mission that we  \n \n          23    must carry out, so I depend on my legal counsel and my  \n \n          24    executive staff and others for advice, and then in my  \n \n          25    decision-making. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             365 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    With regard to executions, do you rely on medical  \n \n           2    advice from anyone? \n \n           3    A    Oh, yes. \n \n           4    Q    Who is that, how we have been describing this  \n \n           5    individual in this proceeding? \n \n           6    A    I have spoken with the experienced members of our team  \n \n           7    that have been involved, directly involved in the  \n \n           8    executions, and I have asked questions, been given  \n \n           9    information about the process, about how it works, about  \n \n          10    the human factor.  And I want to make clear that there's a  \n \n          11    lot more to this execution process than what we have been  \n \n          12    talking about in court for two days, the actual injection  \n \n          13    process.  There's a lot of security, a lot of other  \n \n          14    employees and planning involved, movements that night and  \n \n          15    preparation before, so I mean as a whole, I have had a lot  \n \n          16    of discussion about that. \n \n          17    Q    Do you also consult with the individual identified in  \n \n          18    this proceeding as Dr. John Doe One? \n \n          19    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          20    Q    Once you get advice from the folks that you need  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 97of 124\n \n          21    advice from, that you want advice from, who makes the final  \n \n          22    decision with regard to executions? \n \n          23    A    I do, within what's legal in the law. \n \n          24    Q    Absolutely.  Did you find out recently that less  \n \n          25    sodium pentothal had been given in recent executions than  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             366 \n \n \n \n           1    you originally expected? \n \n           2    A    Yes. \n \n           3    Q    What had been your expectation as to the amount of  \n \n           4    sodium pentothal that had been given? \n \n           5    A    Five grams.  It's my understanding that five grams of  \n \n           6    sodium pentothal had been given in all the executions  \n \n           7    during my tenure, and at least some time before that. \n \n           8    Q    And recently, what different amount of sodium  \n \n           9    pentothal have you found out has been given in recent  \n \n          10    executions? \n \n          11    A    I found out it had been reduced, and I believe two and  \n \n          12    a half grams had been given in some of the prior  \n \n          13    executions. \n \n          14    Q    Who do you understand made the decision to reduce the  \n \n          15    dose? \n \n          16    A    The doctor, John Doe One. \n \n          17    Q    Is that a matter that you should have been informed  \n \n          18    about before Dr. Doe made the decision to reduce the dose? \n \n          19    A    Yes.  When I first became aware of that, I was  \n \n          20    extremely concerned and disappointed, particularly that we  \n \n          21    had provided wrong information in a court proceeding, was  \n \n          22    particularly disappointed that I wasn't made aware of a  \n \n          23    change being made by the doctor. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 98of 124\n \n          24              As more information came to light and I have  \n \n          25    learned more about this process, and I'm still concerned,  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             367 \n \n \n \n           1    but I have discovered some reasons why now that the doctor  \n \n           2    may have made the decisions he made, but I should have been  \n \n           3    notified. \n \n           4    Q    What's your understanding as to the reasons the doctor  \n \n           5    acted on? \n \n           6    A    The difference in the packaging of the drugs didn't  \n \n           7    allow him to use the amount that had been used, and  \n \n           8    possibly -- possibly his understanding that a lesser amount  \n \n           9    had been ordered in some other states, that it may have  \n \n          10    been more appropriate, and putting those two factors  \n \n          11    together allowed him to make the decision of what he  \n \n          12    thought was best at that execution. \n \n          13    Q    What's your understanding as to how Dr. Doe came to  \n \n          14    the conclusion that he would be able to alter the dose on  \n \n          15    his own? \n \n          16    A    He has had a lot of history with the state of Missouri  \n \n          17    and maybe -- and in the execution process.  He was  \n \n          18    consulted when -- back when there was little knowledge --  \n \n          19    less knowledge, I think, about lethal injection, and there  \n \n          20    isn't a lot of experts in this field, it's not a medical  \n \n          21    field, a medical procedure, and so he had put a lot of  \n \n          22    effort in working this.  And other directors have depended  \n \n          23    on him heavily I think to provide a constitutional, humane  \n \n          24    execution, and I think he's taken that very seriously and  \n \n          25    feels that he has successfully been able to deliver, as  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             368 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 99of 124\n \n \n \n           1    does the Department and the people that I have talked to in  \n \n           2    the Department, on the executions before I became director,  \n \n           3    feel like he has done a very good job and successfully  \n \n           4    completed that mission. \n \n           5    Q    Other than the aspect of the question you should have  \n \n           6    been informed of the decision to reduce the level, what's  \n \n           7    your view as to the reduction -- what's your understanding  \n \n           8    as to the reduction of the dosage from five grams to 2.5  \n \n           9    grams? \n \n          10    A    Well, in my first understanding of any drugs or the  \n \n          11    combination of drugs that we gave going back to my first  \n \n          12    month or two, my first months with the Department of  \n \n          13    Corrections, the way it was described to me is that the  \n \n          14    sodium pentothal was given in a dosage that was twelve  \n \n          15    times the amount normally given in an operating room, a  \n \n          16    surgical-type setting when sodium pentothal was used daily  \n \n          17    as a drug.  And that, in my mind, because I had to get a  \n \n          18    feel for this whole process, the first, the beginning was  \n \n          19    the drug that rendered you unconscious and that number  \n \n          20    twelve stuck in my mind, five grams, and so that came --  \n \n          21    when I learned of the two and a half grams I immediately --  \n \n          22    half of five is two and a half, I went to six times the  \n \n          23    amount.  And it was my understanding, and I think in my  \n \n          24    prior deposition, you know, I believed that both rendered  \n \n          25    you in such a full state of unconsciousness to still  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             369 \n \n \n \n           1    complete the mission.  But that didn't excuse the fact that  \n \n           2    it changed and without the records and without my  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 100of 124\n \n           3    knowledge. \n \n           4    Q    Are you planning to make any changes now with regard  \n \n           5    to the execution process to firm up the way that it's done? \n \n           6    A    Yes, I do. \n \n           7    Q    Is there a directive or an order already issued? \n \n           8    A    No.  We normally have, I think always have 30 days'  \n \n           9    notice by the court when to set an execution.  There are --  \n \n          10    time has been taken up some with the court proceedings and  \n \n          11    a myriad of other things that are going on in the  \n \n          12    Department.  I have begun discussions with legal counsel,  \n \n          13    other folks within the Department on how we should issue  \n \n          14    this directive, and I have said very firmly and quickly  \n \n          15    that we were going to put together a team and come forward  \n \n          16    with a defined -- a fairly defined protocol so that this  \n \n          17    didn't happen again and to set out the procedure definitely  \n \n          18    what discretion there would be, the areas of discretion.   \n \n          19    And also on the recordkeeping end.  So we're just going to  \n \n          20    make this process better and there will be a directive  \n \n          21    forthcoming on that. \n \n          22    Q    Have you already made some determinations as to what  \n \n          23    you expect this forthcoming directive to look like? \n \n          24    A    Only in general terms, that we will pull together  \n \n          25    the people that are involved as well as John Doe One and  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             370 \n \n \n \n           1    come -- and there will be a clear understanding of the  \n \n           2    process, notifications, and we will reach an agreement that  \n \n           3    that's what we will follow, absent any order of the court  \n \n           4    before then. \n \n           5    Q    What's your expectation as to the amount of sodium  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 101of 124\n \n           6    pentothal that is going to be provided under the proposed  \n \n           7    directive? \n \n           8    A    Five grams, I guess mixed in a 60 cc solution would be  \n \n           9    my full intentions of what will happen in the directive. \n \n          10    Q    Given the packaging issues that the doctor needs to  \n \n          11    know, is there going to be some leeway with regard to  \n \n          12    whether or not the five grams of pentothal are going to be  \n \n          13    administered in one 60 cc syringe? \n \n          14    A    Yes.  If it's not able to be delivered in a single  \n \n          15    syringe, which may be preferable, but if it's not it could  \n \n          16    be administered in more than one syringe but it will be,  \n \n          17    absent any further -- a different order, five grams in a  \n \n          18    60 cc solution in one or more syringes followed with a  \n \n          19    flush. \n \n          20    Q    Okay.  Is there going to be any amount of flush  \n \n          21    mandated? \n \n          22    A    No.  I have thought that through and talked to some  \n \n          23    folks because I believe there is some discretion that  \n \n          24    should be allowed for the best practices that would be the  \n \n          25    amount of flush necessary to clear the lines and clear the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             371 \n \n \n \n           1    drug.  I expect that will probably be about 30 cc's,  \n \n           2    approximately.  But there would be discretion on the staff  \n \n           3    on that, 30 cc's or half of a 60 cc syringe that's  \n \n           4    currently being used. \n \n           5    Q    After the flush that follows the sodium pentothal,  \n \n           6    what's the expectation as to the next drug? \n \n           7    A    The next drug would be pancuronium bromide.  It would  \n \n           8    be 60 milligrams mixed in a 60 cc solution, also followed  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 102of 124\n \n           9    by a flush with discretion, but very similar to the first  \n \n          10    drug, about the other half, approximately, of that 60 cc  \n \n          11    syringe. \n \n          12    Q    And then with regard -- after the second flush, the  \n \n          13    flush following the pancuronium what's expected to follow  \n \n          14    that? \n \n          15    A    The third drug would be the potassium chloride,  \n \n          16    240 milliequivalents in 120 cc solution followed by a flush  \n \n          17    that will be more than enough to clear the lines and more  \n \n          18    likely to be the 60 cc syringe, the full amount. \n \n          19    Q    Under the directive as you're conceiving it, will the  \n \n          20    dose -- will the drugs themselves, the order of the drugs  \n \n          21    and the doses be items that can be changed at any one  \n \n          22    else's discretion besides yours? \n \n          23    A    No. \n \n          24    Q    What's the expectation as to the means of  \n \n          25    administering the drugs into the inmate's body as you're  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             372 \n \n \n \n           1    expecting the directive to be? \n \n           2    A    I expect that while the first choice would be the  \n \n           3    femoral vein, would not limit it to that because there  \n \n           4    could be circumstances where that might not be available or  \n \n           5    appropriate, but that would be a preference.  But there  \n \n           6    would be discretion on the doctor. \n \n           7    Q    Is that something that would require preapproval to  \n \n           8    change the access from femoral access to some other access  \n \n           9    if the doctor believed it appropriate? \n \n          10    A    No, he could make that judgment on that execution.  I  \n \n          11    would have discussions and expect if this was going to be  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 103of 124\n \n          12    an ongoing change, that we should have that discussion, or  \n \n          13    it became a priority rather than an option. \n \n          14    Q    Is it your intent that this proposed directive will be  \n \n          15    unalterable in the future? \n \n          16    A    No.  I couldn't, in any good judgment, set something  \n \n          17    this important and cast something in stone.  My mind would  \n \n          18    always have to think there could -- things could happen.   \n \n          19    Drugs could no longer be on the market.  There could be new  \n \n          20    information.  Of course there could be court orders.  There  \n \n          21    could just be a myriad of things that could happen.  But  \n \n          22    probably in the next -- in the near future I wouldn't  \n \n          23    expect any of those things to change.  They would be the  \n \n          24    same, because Missouri does have good experience.  In  \n \n          25    talking -- in my talking with the state witnesses, with my  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             373 \n \n \n \n           1    own employees that have been active in those, I believe the  \n \n           2    process has worked and it's worked well.  So I would  \n \n           3    anticipate continuing with the process that I just  \n \n           4    mentioned unless there was some reason that really was  \n \n           5    necessary or a good reason to deviate or change. \n \n           6    Q    And if there were a reason to change, who would decide  \n \n           7    whether there was a good reason to make that change or not? \n \n           8    A    Ultimately it would be me, and again I would not make  \n \n           9    those kind of changes on just my own -- on my own without  \n \n          10    consultation with more than one person. \n \n          11    Q    What plans are expected to be made to ensure that once  \n \n          12    this directive is prepared, to see that it's carried out? \n \n          13    A    I plan to invoke an auditing process, change the  \n \n          14    recordkeeping that we presently have, and have a quick  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 104of 124\n \n          15    auditing process the day following.  Actually I guess it  \n \n          16    would be the same day because the execution normally  \n \n          17    happens shortly after midnight, but considering a normal  \n \n          18    workday starts at 7:30 a.m. inside an institution, that we  \n \n          19    would have an auditing process.  For some time at least in  \n \n          20    the future I would have that information sent directly to  \n \n          21    me so that I could look over it and feel comfortable with  \n \n          22    not only the execution that happened and the recordkeeping,  \n \n          23    but also the process of auditing -- the auditing process,  \n \n          24    and it will probably come through the director of Adult  \n \n          25    Institutions to me also until I was confident with it that  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             374 \n \n \n \n           1    I could delegate that as it should be. \n \n           2    Q    Are there any plans as to how you would expect to let  \n \n           3    the persons that are involved in the execution process know  \n \n           4    that this directive is coming out and what's imposed,  \n \n           5    what's discretionary? \n \n           6    A    Yes, it will be in writing, but we will have a meeting  \n \n           7    face-to-face with my staff and medical staff, John Doe One. \n \n           8    Q    And will it be emphasized what is discretionary and  \n \n           9    what is nondiscretionary, what requires your preapproval to  \n \n          10    change? \n \n          11    A    Yes.  As I set out, and John Doe One, he or she, the  \n \n          12    doctor will need to agree to that, and I have every reason  \n \n          13    to believe that they will. \n \n          14              MR. PRITCHETT:  One moment, please, Judge.   \n \n          15              Thank you, Mr. Crawford.  That's all that I  \n \n          16    have.   \n \n          17    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HELLMAN:  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 105of 124\n \n          18    Q    Good afternoon, Mr. Crawford.  \n \n          19    A    Good afternoon. \n \n          20    Q    So it's correct that you have ultimate authority for  \n \n          21    all aspects of the execution procedure in Missouri? \n \n          22    A    Under the constitution and law, I believe so, yes. \n \n          23    Q    You spoke about the review process when you came on  \n \n          24    board as director of corrections.  You said you met with  \n \n          25    your executive staff to learn about the procedure.  Did  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             375 \n \n \n \n           1    that staff include any doctors? \n \n           2    A    No. \n \n           3    Q    Did you consult any doctors in learning about the  \n \n           4    medical aspects of the execution procedure? \n \n           5    A    No.  I don't have -- I mean, I actually have a doctor  \n \n           6    on my executive staff, but I didn't -- I don't think I can  \n \n           7    say that I consulted with him directly about the injection  \n \n           8    process and the things that you are interested in.  I did  \n \n           9    consult with him about other parts of the execution  \n \n          10    process. \n \n          11    Q    Thank you.  So then you didn't consult with John Doe  \n \n          12    One as a doctor regarding the medical aspects of the  \n \n          13    execution procedure? \n \n          14    A    No, I did not. \n \n          15    Q    In your deposition which took place on May 23rd, you  \n \n          16    said you had no plans to review Missouri's execution  \n \n          17    procedure unless new information came forward.  Is the  \n \n          18    directive that you've been talking about today the product  \n \n          19    of new information? \n \n          20    A    Yes, I think so. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 106of 124\n \n          21    Q    And what is that information specifically that's  \n \n          22    motivated you to issue this directive, or plan to issue  \n \n          23    this directive? \n \n          24    A    Well, it's the continuing information that I have  \n \n          25    learned about the packaging of the -- the change in the  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             376 \n \n \n \n           1    packaging in the material and some of those challenges.   \n \n           2    The recordkeeping, and just the new information that has  \n \n           3    actually become available through some of the court  \n \n           4    proceedings and some of the discovery.  I know you  \n \n           5    mentioned May 26th, but I believe during those  \n \n           6    interrogatories I told you I would look at -- I would  \n \n           7    continue to look at this, I would process that information  \n \n           8    and make an appropriate decision.  And that's what I'm  \n \n           9    continuing to do, since on May 26th I had very little time  \n \n          10    to -- I had a short period of time to understand any of  \n \n          11    these things, and I had not talked with John Doe One. \n \n          12    Q    Have you talked to John Doe One since the deposition  \n \n          13    that took place? \n \n          14    A    Yes, I have. \n \n          15    Q    And could you describe that conversation? \n \n          16    A    He called me actually.  This was I think after his  \n \n          17    deposition, and probably wanted to reassure me that he had  \n \n          18    a constitutional -- the Department's best interest in mind,  \n \n          19    that he had always been focused on a humane execution, and  \n \n          20    gave me information about I guess sort of his level, some  \n \n          21    of his level of experience, which was great, in this  \n \n          22    process, and that he was willing to continue to do the good  \n \n          23    job he'd been doing and work with me as needed. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 107of 124\n \n          24    Q    Did you find him credible in this conversation? \n \n          25    A    Yes.  And I have spoken to him in other conversations  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             377 \n \n \n \n           1    and a lot of times they were more of a waiting and more of  \n \n           2    a casual conversation, not about the medical side of this.   \n \n           3    So I have sort of gotten to know him over a period of time  \n \n           4    so I can judge him from that more than just this one  \n \n           5    conversation.  I have known him to be very bright,  \n \n           6    professional, articulate, and quick, very quick. \n \n           7    Q    You mentioned a directive in your testimony, and I  \n \n           8    understand that the court has made a statement about that  \n \n           9    so I'll be very brief in my questions regarding it.  Have  \n \n          10    you formally adopted this directive? \n \n          11    A    No, I have not. \n \n          12    Q    What day will the directive be adopted? \n \n          13    A    I couldn't answer that question because I don't know  \n \n          14    as of today, but it will be before we have an execution  \n \n          15    set. \n \n          16    Q    So then you wouldn't execute Mr. Taylor before issuing  \n \n          17    this directive? \n \n          18    A    Oh, no. \n \n          19    Q    And why not? \n \n          20    A    Because I want -- I want to assure that the process is  \n \n          21    better and I want to assure that we know distinctly the  \n \n          22    amount of drugs that are going to be administered and in  \n \n          23    good order and have that recordkeeping process in place. \n \n          24    Q    Do you think Missouri is ready to undertake executions  \n \n          25    today not having this directive in place?  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             378 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 108of 124\n \n \n \n           1    A    We couldn't undertake it today.  I believe there is  \n \n           2    always 30 days, we have 30 days' notice.  In fact, my  \n \n           3    schedule is normally checked by the Supreme Court.  They  \n \n           4    will check our schedule before they set the date, or give  \n \n           5    us some tentative dates, so I don't know that that's  \n \n           6    pertinent.  I will say I have faith that we have done  \n \n           7    constitutional and humane executions, the ones that I have  \n \n           8    had experience with.   \n \n           9    Q    Let me try to ask my question a different way.  If  \n \n          10    there were a hypothetical prisoner for whom the 30-day  \n \n          11    period had lapsed or passed such that he could be executed  \n \n          12    today by law, do you believe Missouri would be ready to  \n \n          13    conduct that execution today not having the directive in  \n \n          14    place that you have talked about? \n \n          15    A    If -- if you -- if we were going to do that today, and  \n \n          16    I suppose you mean 12:01 midnight tonight, I would quickly  \n \n          17    put together that protocol that I mentioned earlier, the  \n \n          18    procedure and the protocol, would have a meeting with my  \n \n          19    team, but we are getting hypotheticals here that we could  \n \n          20    find everybody and get them there by midnight tonight and  \n \n          21    there weren't going to be all the other barriers, legal  \n \n          22    barriers to an execution.  But, yes, I think with what we  \n \n          23    have in place we could do the same good job, maybe even  \n \n          24    better, because -- because I could put that together that \n \n          25    quickly.  Now, I'd rather have more time to do something of  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             379 \n \n \n \n           1    this magnitude, and I think I will have that time. \n \n           2    Q    I'll just try to make my point clear so I'm coming  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 109of 124\n \n           3    across.  Let's assume that the directive wasn't able to be  \n \n           4    put in place and the execution was going forward today,  \n \n           5    would you -- do you believe Missouri would be ready to  \n \n           6    handle an execution, go forward with that execution absent  \n \n           7    the directive? \n \n           8    A    We are charged under law to do the execution so if  \n \n           9    you're telling me I was ordered to have an execution  \n \n          10    tonight, I would proceed with the execution.  Had I had  \n \n          11    the proper safeguards in my mind and the ability to do a  \n \n          12    constitutional -- fulfill my constitutional duty, yes, I  \n \n          13    could do it tonight. \n \n          14    Q    I don't mean to belabor the point -- \n \n          15              THE COURT:  But you are belaboring the point.   \n \n          16    Move on to another question if you can't phrase that  \n \n          17    question any better than you have.  Okay? \n \n          18              MR. HELLMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor. \n \n          19    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Do you reserve the right to change  \n \n          20    this directive in the future after Mr. Taylor has been  \n \n          21    executed? \n \n          22    A    Not in the -- not in the near future.  I just only  \n \n          23    reserve the right to change it if need be, but I have no --  \n \n          24    I -- no, I have no reason to just change it for the sake of  \n \n          25    any reason other than out of some type of necessity or as I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             380 \n \n \n \n           1    mentioned before, new information, court orders. \n \n           2    Q    Would this directive require anesthetic monitoring? \n \n           3    A    No. \n \n           4    Q    Would it provide for improved visibility of the inmate  \n \n           5    during the execution? \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 110of 124\n \n           6    A    I'm sorry? \n \n           7    Q    Would it provide for improved visibility of the inmate  \n \n           8    during the execution? \n \n           9    A    Visibility to the inmate? \n \n          10    Q    Visibility of the inmate by, say, the medical  \n \n          11    personnel. \n \n          12    A    It would have the same -- this directive would have  \n \n          13    the same visibility that -- it would be the same as it has  \n \n          14    been in the past.  There's a large window there and I have  \n \n          15    certainly had discussions with my staff about what they  \n \n          16    see, and it's different than what I saw in one picture. \n \n          17    Q    So it wouldn't allow for a full view of the IV tube? \n \n          18    A    No. \n \n          19    Q    Would it impose any timing safeguards to ensure that  \n \n          20    the thiopental had taken full effect to achieve burst  \n \n          21    suppression before other drugs are administered? \n \n          22    A    The procedure as far as the syringes and the timing  \n \n          23    that has been set forth successfully by the doctor, and  \n \n          24    there is some timing issues that I believe are important in  \n \n          25    this, would remain -- remain as they have been. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             381 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Have you consulted with any medical personnel in  \n \n           2    deciding to make or not make any of the modifications you  \n \n           3    have just discussed and the other modifications you have  \n \n           4    talked about in your testimony today? \n \n           5    A    Did you say consulted with medical personnel? \n \n           6    Q    Yes. \n \n           7    A    No, I have not.  With any new medical personnel? \n \n           8    Q    With any medical personnel, new or old. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 111of 124\n \n           9    A    No, I -- no, I have not contacted anyone.  I have  \n \n          10    given -- I have done some reading.  Of course, we have had  \n \n          11    expert witnesses here yesterday and today that I have  \n \n          12    listened to what they have to say.  And I am firmly  \n \n          13    convinced that while we use components of a medical  \n \n          14    procedure, this is not a medical procedure.  The execution  \n \n          15    is not a medical procedure, and that would make -- makes it  \n \n          16    quite difficult in consulting with medical doctors that are  \n \n          17    charged with saving lives when we are ordered and under a  \n \n          18    duty to take a life under the law.  And that is a  \n \n          19    difference. \n \n          20              And as director I have to -- I have to consider  \n \n          21    that if this was a medical procedure that required somebody  \n \n          22    to undergo anesthesia or to be rendered unconscious, in the  \n \n          23    first place, we don't do those procedures inside our  \n \n          24    correctional institution.  We have contracts with hospitals  \n \n          25    and medical folks that do those in medical settings.  So  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             382 \n \n \n \n           1    when I keep hearing the doctors, there's a very narrow -- a  \n \n           2    very narrow group of people that have any expertise, I  \n \n           3    believe, with a lethal injection and actually have  \n \n           4    experience in doing that successfully.  I haven't heard any  \n \n           5    of those people actually in the courtroom here today or  \n \n           6    yesterday that have had those -- that have actually  \n \n           7    successfully carried out an execution under the law. \n \n           8    Q    But would it be consistent with your understanding of  \n \n           9    what Missouri's goals are to have a prisoner who woke up  \n \n          10    when the second of those drugs was being administered I  \n \n          11    take it?  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 112of 124\n \n          12    A    If I had somebody to testify to that, that would  \n \n          13    certainly -- I think that would be very legitimate  \n \n          14    testimony. \n \n          15    Q    Would it be consistent with Missouri's goals for  \n \n          16    executions to use a procedure that posed a significant risk  \n \n          17    of severe bleeding, say with femoral catheterization? \n \n          18    A    Certainly not.  That's why we use a medical -- a  \n \n          19    medical doctor to do that, to make the insertion, which is  \n \n          20    more -- I told you there are some components of a medical  \n \n          21    procedure, and the insertion of a catheter would be a  \n \n          22    component of a medical procedure. \n \n          23    Q    But you're saying that the testimony you have heard  \n \n          24    today and yesterday about, say, the risks of insufficient  \n \n          25    anesthesia or the risks of significant bleeding aren't  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             383 \n \n \n \n           1    relevant because the persons giving that testimony have not  \n \n           2    conducted executions themselves? \n \n           3    A    I don't believe I said that was not relevant. \n \n           4    Q    In what way is it relevant then?  \n \n           5    A    As bleeding has to do with part of a humane  \n \n           6    execution, I think that could be -- that is relevant.   \n \n           7    And because we do use a drug that is used in a surgical  \n \n           8    procedure, that -- some of those parts are relevant.  I  \n \n           9    said there are components of the medical procedure.  When  \n \n          10    you're talking about causing death, I think then there are  \n \n          11    parts that are very different.  Maybe I -- I'm sorry if I  \n \n          12    didn't make my point very clear. \n \n          13    Q    How does the detail in the directive you described  \n \n          14    compare to the substance of the detail in the execution  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 113of 124\n \n          15    procedure, such as security?  For example, you said that  \n \n          16    you prescribed the dosages and the drugs and a guide on  \n \n          17    femoral access.  If that's the substance of the directive,  \n \n          18    is that more or less detailed than the directives that  \n \n          19    concern the security aspects of the execution procedure?  \n \n          20    A    In some cases, about the same I would say.  We have  \n \n          21    detailed security as to -- as to who has what job, as to as  \n \n          22    far as weapons go, if we make -- we try to make a  \n \n          23    comparison about what type of weapons our security will be  \n \n          24    armed with as specified.  That would be sort of like  \n \n          25    specifying I guess which drug and what amount. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             384 \n \n \n \n           1              And I think, as I mentioned earlier, there will  \n \n           2    be some flexibility need to be given and some discretion in  \n \n           3    that execution room for things that might come up and --  \n \n           4    and come up so quickly and need to be dealt with that a  \n \n           5    decision would have to be made there without going through  \n \n           6    me.  And those are also in the protocols, of course, for  \n \n           7    the security.  So I think it's a fair comparison to say  \n \n           8    that they would be very similar. \n \n           9    Q    How many pages is the security aspects of the protocol  \n \n          10    for an execution procedure? \n \n          11    A    I don't know that I could guess the pages, but I can  \n \n          12    probably give you a thickness. \n \n          13    Q    How thick then? \n \n          14    A    Okay.  Three-quarter's, a half, three-quarter's of an  \n \n          15    inch thick probably. \n \n          16    Q    Is it fair to say that the directive you're talking  \n \n          17    about today could fit on a single page?   \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 114of 124\n \n          18    A    I don't believe they'd fit on a single page.  You  \n \n          19    could, I guess, depending on how small you made the type.   \n \n          20    I think they would be more than a page, but I don't think  \n \n          21    they would be a hundred pages either.  I hadn't really  \n \n          22    considered that. \n \n          23    Q    Thank you.  How many -- you have already said that  \n \n          24    five grams of thiopental have not been used in recent  \n \n          25    executions in Missouri.  What was the basis for your  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             385 \n \n \n \n           1    statement that five grams had been used when you made that  \n \n           2    statement previously in interrogatories? \n \n           3    A    That was my belief, and I think there are multiple  \n \n           4    components to how that happened.  One, I think we based --   \n \n           5    this isn't the first case where those types of questions  \n \n           6    have been asked, and I think one of the things was we  \n \n           7    probably relied on the misunderstanding and mistake that  \n \n           8    nothing had changed.  We had gotten those figures from the  \n \n           9    doc from an execution that may have happened late 2005 and  \n \n          10    assumed that those drugs were still given, and actually it  \n \n          11    may have been before that time.  And then there was some  \n \n          12    oversights, and I just am not happy with that, but it just  \n \n          13    happened. \n \n          14    Q    Did Doe One ever tell you personally that he'd been  \n \n          15    giving five grams of thiopental, say, before the start of  \n \n          16    this year? \n \n          17    A    Not that I can recall. \n \n          18    Q    Did Doe One ever tell you he was having trouble mixing  \n \n          19    thiopental? \n \n          20    A    No, he did not. \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 115of 124\n \n          21    Q    Or that he was dyslexic and had difficulty with  \n \n          22    numbers? \n \n          23    A    No, he did not. \n \n          24    Q    Did you and he ever discuss the relative advantages of  \n \n          25    femoral access? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             386 \n \n \n \n           1    A    My early understanding, and which I still understand,  \n \n           2    but the early description of that was that it is a large  \n \n           3    and a strong vein so it doesn't have some of the strength  \n \n           4    issues that people have in a weakened health condition or  \n \n           5    people that have abused their body in their lifetime, so  \n \n           6    it's a strong, large vein.  And it also provides quick  \n \n           7    access to the heart so it will provide a quick and humane  \n \n           8    execution, so that it's very preferable.  Can be  \n \n           9    preferable, anyway. \n \n          10    Q    And Doe One is the source of your information that you  \n \n          11    just described? \n \n          12    A    Actually, I got most of that information from my staff  \n \n          13    that talks directly with John Doe One and I do have staff  \n \n          14    -- as director I mentioned we have 11,400 employees that  \n \n          15    are responsible for around 100,000 convicted felons and  \n \n          16    there's quite a bit of work that goes on in our daily  \n \n          17    duties that fall outside the execution process, so I have  \n \n          18    got most of this information through legal counsel, through  \n \n          19    people that are directly working with the execution team  \n \n          20    that have talked directly with that. \n \n          21              Most of my discussions with John Doe One have  \n \n          22    been at the institution on the night of, and that's  \n \n          23    something that we don't usually talk about, any issues that  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 116of 124\n \n          24    wouldn't just come up immediately.  We talk about -- more  \n \n          25    of a social time because, as you can imagine, it's not  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             387 \n \n \n \n           1    something that we're -- it's something that we're charged  \n \n           2    with doing, but it's not something that we're just focusing  \n \n           3    on the details of I guess. \n \n           4    Q    And just to sum up, you rely on your staff and your  \n \n           5    staff rely on John Doe One for the discussion of the  \n \n           6    relative merits of femoral access? \n \n           7    A    Yes, I'd say that would be fair. \n \n           8    Q    Are you going to continue -- excuse me, strike that.   \n \n           9    Will you continue to allow John Doe One to take part in  \n \n          10    Missouri's executions? \n \n          11    A    Yes. \n \n          12    Q    Have you had any conversation with that individual  \n \n          13    about his continued employment with the state? \n \n          14    A    No, I have not.  I have not indicated that, but I have  \n \n          15    not indicated otherwise.  I did just talk to him the one  \n \n          16    time that I mentioned.  But that is my plan, if you ask,  \n \n          17    that he will. \n \n          18    Q    So you have confidence in Doe One's competence and  \n \n          19    training to carry out executions? \n \n          20    A    Yes, and I base that heavily on his success and the  \n \n          21    demeanor and the efficiency and all the information I have  \n \n          22    gathered from my staff and from state witnesses on the  \n \n          23    executions that I have been involved with and those before  \n \n          24    that he has been involved with, and he has been involved  \n \n          25    with all those I'm talking about. \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             388 \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 117of 124\n \n \n \n           1    Q    You may recall yesterday we talked a little bit with  \n \n           2    various witnesses about Doe One's statements that it would  \n \n           3    be impossible for him to cause significant bleeding using  \n \n           4    the femoral vein technique, and I also believe that he said  \n \n           5    that anyone who had done the procedure more than ten times  \n \n           6    would never have a complication.   \n \n           7              I'd like to show you briefly -- \n \n           8              THE COURT:  Mr. Hellman, how much more time? \n \n           9              MR. HELLMAN:  Ten minutes. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  Five minutes. \n \n          11              MR. HELLMAN:  If I can approach the witness then. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Yes. \n \n          13              MR. PRITCHETT:  May I ask what you handed to the  \n \n          14    witness. \n \n          15              MR. HELLMAN:  I have handed the witness what is  \n \n          16    labeled I believe Plaintiff's Exhibit 27.  These are the  \n \n          17    photos from the Collective Exhibit 18 which is the Timothy  \n \n          18    Johnston execution that was discussed yesterday. \n \n          19    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  Do you believe John Doe One is  \n \n          20    correct when he says that it would be impossible for him to  \n \n          21    cause significant bleeding through the femoral  \n \n          22    catheterization technique? \n \n          23    A    I -- I would have to qualify any of my answers on that  \n \n          24    with my relationship and what I have seen in talking with  \n \n          25    John Doe One, and I will say this, in talking to him more  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             389 \n \n \n \n           1    on a conversational level than on just a professional  \n \n           2    level, but he has a tendency to communicate sometimes by  \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 118of 124\n \n           3    overstatements, and I don't mean being untruthful in any  \n \n           4    way, or not professional, but he has kind of a quick way of  \n \n           5    overstating things to make a point.  And so when I read  \n \n           6    that in his deposition I thought, well, you know, that's  \n \n           7    sort of like a story, if you were going to say how many  \n \n           8    mushrooms you found or how many fish you caught or how big  \n \n           9    your fish were, you might say, and he'd say something is  \n \n          10    impossible. \n \n          11              THE COURT:  What was the question? \n \n          12              MR. HELLMAN:  The question was -- well, the court  \n \n          13    reporter can read it back, but my understanding of the  \n \n          14    question was John Doe One has said it's impossible for him  \n \n          15    to cause bleeding, significant bleeding, through the  \n \n          16    femoral vein technique.  I asked if the witness had  \n \n          17    confidence in John Doe One, given that statement and those  \n \n          18    photos.  \n \n          19    A    My judgment would be that it would not be impossible,  \n \n          20    that there's very few things that are impossible.  So I  \n \n          21    would take issue with it being impossible in my judgment,  \n \n          22    not medical judgment. \n \n          23    Q    (By Mr. Hellman)  During an execution, you're not in  \n \n          24    either the execution support room or the execution room  \n \n          25    itself? \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             390 \n \n \n \n           1    A    I am not. \n \n           2    Q    Under Missouri's procedures, does John Doe One have  \n \n           3    the authority to deal with any unforeseen complication as  \n \n           4    it arises without consulting you? \n \n           5    A    Could you -- does he have any -- \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 119of 124\n \n           6    Q    Must John Doe One consult you before dealing with an  \n \n           7    unforeseen complication that occurs during an execution? \n \n           8    A    No.  I think -- I think if it were unforeseen, that he  \n \n \n           9    could -- would need to, in many cases, obviously respond to  \n \n          10    that immediately.  I don't believe he would ask me if he  \n \n          11    needed to apply pressure to stop the bleeding, for  \n \n          12    instance.  That would be something that you'd respond to.   \n \n          13    Similar to, I would guess, that he would -- he would have  \n \n          14    similar to those kind of responsibilities assigned to him  \n \n          15    in an operating room when he couldn't refer to the hospital  \n \n          16    administrator or the consenting family member. \n \n          17    Q    And if he were to consult with you on a medical  \n \n          18    question, would you defer to him? \n \n          19    A    I would give heavy weight -- I would give some weight  \n \n          20    because of his expertise in the execution procedure.  I  \n \n          21    would certainly give some credibility.  And he would have  \n \n          22    a part in my decision-making process, but I certainly  \n \n          23    don't -- wouldn't give him full credibility in that  \n \n          24    decision-making by any means. \n \n          25    Q    What are you basing your view that John Doe One had, I  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             391 \n \n \n \n           1    believe you used the word success, in carrying out  \n \n           2    execution procedures?  How would you know if he were not  \n \n           3    successful? \n \n           4    A    I would think that if we had a -- well, it could be a  \n \n           5    myriad of reasons.  One thing, we prepare the patient.  My  \n \n           6    staff tells me that they're cordial, the doctor is cordial,  \n \n           7    that there is no pain.  They are very responsive to  \n \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 120of 124\n           8    discomfort.  Staff and doctor are in communication with the  \n \n           9    condemned.  In fact, some of them, there are various  \n \n          10    stages, we offer a sedative.  Some of them don't accept  \n \n          11    those.  Some of them do.  Some of them are joking and  \n \n          12    talking and telling stories.  Some of them are quiet.  So,  \n \n          13    I mean, I even got a letter on just one of the recent  \n \n          14    executions from an inmate condemned that did not leave a  \n \n          15    prepared last statement, but he thanked the superintendent  \n \n          16    of the prison on how he was treated.  So I believe that --  \n \n          17    I believe that we are humanely and properly preparing them  \n \n          18    for execution. \n \n          19              My staff tells me that after the first drug  \n \n          20    is pushed, the sodium pentothal, that they can see --  \n \n          21    sometimes I mentioned there is a sedative given.  We have  \n \n          22    even had to awake a condemned for the execution so that  \n \n          23    they can see their family or whatever.  And they tell me  \n \n          24    that after they push the plunger it's just a very short  \n \n          25    period of time that they can see their head drop and them  \n(cid:31) \n                                                                             392 \n \n \n \n           1    go to sleep, that they can just see them relax.  And then a  \n \n           2    very short period of time after that the doctor, using some  \n \n           3    kind of electronic machine that flat lines, pronounces them \n \n           4    dead.  So to me a quick, a humane execution is one where I  \n \n           5    don't believe there is -- there is much pain, and then it's  \n \n           6    carried -- it's not a lingering death. \n \n           7              And we have had no reports of excessive blood or  \n \n           8    all these other scenarios that can be thrown out.  Or  \n \n           9    somebody sitting up I think was mentioned before.  So I  \n \n          10    think we're successful in doing that. \n \nhttp://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/Lethal%20Injection%20Documents/Missouri... 6/16/2007\n\nPage 121of 124\n          11    Q    Are you aware of the effect that pancuronium bromide  \n \n          12    has on a prisoner, the paralysis effect? \n \n          13    A    Yes, I am.   \n \n          14    Q    Does Missouri do any toxicology reports to ascertain  \n \n          15    how much of the drug, the drugs, were delivered to the  \n \n          16    body, after death? \n \n          17    A    No, we don't. \n \n          18    Q    Is the pancuronium necessary, in your mind, to  \n \n          19    accomplish an efficient and humane death? \n \n          20              THE COURT:  I don't think he has given any  \n \n          21    testimony that he has any medical background, Mr. Hellman. \n \n          22              MR.

If we did not use pancuronium bromide we might  \n \n           3    need to use something else or totally different drugs to  \n \n           4    complete the procedure.  I think any time you change or  \n \n           5    take out one would make me revisit the whole process. \n \n           6              THE COURT:  Your time is up, Mr. Hellman. \n \n           7              MR.

PRITCHETT:  I will, Judge.  The person here  \n \n           9    today representing himself as John Doe 1 is the person we  \n \n          10    have represented throughout this litigation as being John  \n \n          11    Doe 1, the physician that is present during executions in  \n \n          12    Missouri. \n \n          13              THE COURT:  All right.   \n \n          14              MS. ANDERS:  I'd just like to note for the record  \n \n          15    that I cannot see the doctor behind the screen and I cannot  \n \n          16    tell whether he is consulting any documents, papers,  \n \n          17    anything else, and I cannot observe his demeanor.  And  \n \n \n          18    plaintiff did not have any notice that that would be the  \n \n          19    case. \n \n          20              THE COURT:  I think it was implied, Ms. -- what  \n \n          21    is your name?   \n \n          22              MS. ANDERS:  Anders, Ginger Anders. \n \n          23              THE COURT:  Ms. Anders.  It was implied in the  \n \n          24    order.  I'm sorry you didn't catch that implication. \n \n          25              And I'll say this, if the witness is referring to  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               3 \n \n \n \n           1    documents, you may be free to ask him if he is referring to  \n \n           2    documents and what documents they are.  Okay?   \n \n           3              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you. \n \n           4              THE COURT:  Rhonda, do you want to swear this  \n \n           5    witness in and we'll get started. \n \n           6    JOHN DOE NO. 1, called as a witness on behalf of the  \n \n           7    Plaintiff, being first duly sworn, testified: \n \n           8              MS. ANDERS:  Before we start, has there been a  \n \n           9    ruling on the protective order? \n \n          10              THE COURT:  I'll rule on that at the end of this. \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you.  And I'd also like to  \n \n          12    note for the record that plaintiff would respectfully  \n \n          13    reiterate -- \n \n          14              THE REPORTER:  I can't hear you. \n \n          15              THE COURT:  There is a microphone on the desk, or  \n \n          16    you can step up to the podium to do your examination.   \n \n          17              That isn't working?  We have been having  \n \n          18    microphone problems. \n \n          19              MS. ANDERS:  So once more I will reiterate  \n \n          20    plaintiff's objections to both the substantive and the  \n \n          21    duration limitations on the deposition. \n \n          22              THE COURT:  I guess if you reiterate, I  \n \n          23    reiterate.  How's that? \n \n          24              MS. ANDERS:   Fair enough. \n \n          25    DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. ANDERS: \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               4 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Doctor, my name is Ginger Anders and I represent  \n \n           2    plaintiff Michael Taylor in this litigation and I'm here to  \n \n           3    depose you today.  So first I just wanted to establish a  \n \n           4    few standard groundrules for the deposition.  Have you ever  \n \n           5    been deposed before? \n \n           6    A    Many times. \n \n           7    Q    So you're probably familiar with this.  What types of  \n \n           8    cases have you been deposed in?  \n \n \n           9    A    Criminal. \n \n          10    Q    What types of criminal cases? \n \n          11    A    As a medical examiner I was testifying in numerous  \n \n          12    cases, death cases, murder cases.  Federal cases. \n \n          13    Q    Any other types of cases? \n \n          14    A    Malpractice cases as an expert witness, plaintiff,  \n \n          15    defendant -- not as plaintiff, but as a defendant on  \n \n          16    malpractice as an expert witness many times. \n \n          17    Q    Okay.  So you will be familiar with these instructions  \n \n          18    I'm sure. \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    But just to go over them once more, if you could speak  \n \n          21    up for the court reporter, she can't see if you nod or  \n \n          22    gesture or anything like that.  Is that okay?   \n \n          23    A    That's fair. \n \n          24    Q    And just tell me if you didn't understand a question.   \n \n          25    If I may say something that isn't quite clear, please tell  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               5 \n \n \n \n           1    me and I'll try to rephrase.  Okay?  Do you understand  \n \n           2    that? \n \n           3    A    Yes, I understand. \n \n           4    Q    Okay, thanks.  And please tell us if you need a  \n \n           5    break.  The only thing about that is I ask that if you to  \n \n           6    need a break and a question is pending, that you answer the  \n \n           7    question first and then we can take a break. \n \n           8    A    Great. \n \n           9    Q    And if you could also please answer my questions  \n \n          10    before consulting with your attorney.  You are certainly  \n \n          11    allowed to consult with your attorney, but if there is a  \n \n          12    question pending please wait until you have answered it  \n \n          13    first. \n \n          14    A    Great. \n \n          15    Q    Okay.  And I'd just like to say for the record that  \n \n \n          16    I'm not here to try to discover your identity.  I'm here to  \n \n          17    ask you questions about the execution procedure and your  \n \n          18    role in it, and most likely there will be a protective  \n \n          19    order that covers parts or all of this deposition so it  \n \n          20    won't be publicly available. \n \n          21              So if you could please list for me every document  \n \n          22    that you have reviewed in preparation for this deposition.  \n \n          23    A    In preparation in the last 24 hours, or the last  \n \n          24    thirty years? \n \n          25    Q    For this deposition in particular. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               6 \n \n \n \n \n           1    A    I met with Mr. Pritchett yesterday to discuss some of  \n \n           2    the previous documents that we had and I reviewed them for \n \n           3    about an hour last night and that's all. \n \n           4    Q    So you reviewed the documents in the possession of the  \n \n           5    state and the Attorney General's Office? \n \n           6    A    Yes. \n \n           7    Q    Did you review any of plaintiff's filings in this  \n \n           8    case? \n \n           9    A    If they were with my documents, yes.  But I do not  \n \n          10    specifically remember any of those. \n \n          11    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  I'd like to introduce a couple of  \n \n          12    exhibits right now. \n \n          13              THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Have they already been  \n \n          14    marked?  \n \n          15              MS.

That's what  \n \n          18    the courtroom deputy is here for. \n \n          19              MS. ANDERS:   Okay. \n \n          20              THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Is this No. 1? \n \n          21              MS. ANDERS:   Yes, Exhibits 1, 2 and 3. \n \n          22              MR. PRITCHETT:  Which order will they be in?  The  \n \n          23    first set, No. 1 -- \n \n          24              MS. ANDERS:   The first set will be Exhibit No.  \n \n          25    1.  The supplemental interrogatory answers will be Exhibit  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               7 \n \n \n \n           1    No. 2.  And the answers to the court's order, Document 148,  \n \n           2    the court's interrogatories, that will be Exhibit No. 3. \n \n           3              THE COURT:  Rhonda, why don't you take them to  \n \n           4    the witness. \n \n           5              THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  All of them, or -- \n \n           6              THE COURT:  Yes. \n \n           7              THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  It will take me a minute  \n \n           8    to mark all of these. \n \n           9              THE COURT:  Well, they need to be marked if  \n \n          10    they're going to be exhibits. \n \n          11              MS. ANDERS:  Would you like a copy, Your Honor? \n \n          12              THE COURT:  If you have an extra one, yes.  If  \n \n          13    you don't, don't worry about it. \n \n          14              MS. ANDERS:   I do. \n \n          15              THE COURT:  Thank you. \n \n          16              MR. PRITCHETT:  Judge, if we get into questions  \n \n          17    such as where did you graduate from school or what year or  \n \n          18    specifically what -- when you received certain  \n \n          19    certifications, pending your ruling I have asked the  \n \n          20    witness to be generic in responses to those questions and  \n \n          21    say to give a range of years or perhaps a general locality  \n \n          22    as to what schools he may have attended. \n \n          23              THE COURT:  I'll address those when we come to  \n \n          24    them.  Okay. \n \n          25              MS. ANDERS:   Okay. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               8 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So, Doctor, you have just been  \n \n           2    handed three documents.  Have you seen these before? \n \n           3    A    Yes. \n \n           4    Q    And are these your answers to plaintiff's and the  \n \n           5    court's interrogatories? \n \n           6    A    Yes. \n \n           7    Q    Did you prepare these answers? \n \n           8    A    With Mr. Pritchett, yes. \n \n           9    Q    Did you review them before they were submitted? \n \n          10    A    I think I did. \n \n          11    Q    Okay.  I'm going to be asking you some questions about  \n \n          12    some of your answers and I also probably will assume your  \n \n          13    familiarity with some of the answers, so if I ask you about  \n \n          14    a particular answer and you don't immediately remember it,  \n \n          15    please just let me know and I can point you to the relevant  \n \n          16    answer so you can refresh your recollection. \n \n \n          17    A    Okay. \n \n          18    Q    So I'd like you to take me step-by-step through the  \n \n          19    process by which you mix thiopental solution for an  \n \n          20    execution.  \n \n          21    A    Okay.  What, where -- \n \n \n          22    Q    Just start at the beginning, assuming, since I have no  \n \n          23    medical background I need a pretty basic explanation.  \n \n          24    A    Last year, ten years ago, thirty years ago?  \n \n          25    Q    The general process you have used for recent  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                               9 \n \n \n \n           1    executions and just how you'd instruct somebody if they  \n \n           2    were going to do an execution in the near future. \n \n           3    A    Oh, well, we were discussing this because pentothal  \n \n           4    currently comes in a container that allows only the  \n \n           5    container to be inserted into itself and mixed with a  \n \n           6    specific volume.  In order to demonstrate this to the court  \n \n           7    we tried to locate the specific container.  There is not a  \n \n           8    single hospital, surgery center, or ambulance literally in  \n \n           9    the state that still carries pentothal. \n \n          10              So what we were using is a formulary dose that  \n \n          11    was provided by the drug company to allow the hospital to  \n \n          12    bill individually to patients rather than using the large  \n \n \n          13    multi-dose vial.  It's not designed to be removed from its  \n \n          14    container.  So currently I have devised a method to mix the  \n \n          15    pentothal with an improvised technique that allows me to  \n \n          16    insert sufficient pentothal into one syringe so that a  \n \n          17    nonmedical person can inject it in the dark. \n \n          18    Q    And could you take me step-by-step through that, your  \n \n          19    improvised process? \n \n          20    A    I'd have to see the containers because I cannot at the  \n \n          21    present time remember whether they have glass or -- they  \n \n          22    are actually just two straight-walled glass bottles.  One  \n \n          23    has powder in the bottom, one has liquid in the bottom, and  \n \n          24    they are designed to lock together and mix.  So I have to  \n \n          25    stick a needle through this plastic and inject my own  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              10 \n \n \n \n           1    diluents which I know will give me no more than 50 cc's for  \n \n           2    the final product, which is what I'm aiming for for the  \n \n           3    final injection. \n \n           4              We have encountered problems trying to mix more  \n \n           5    than three or four grams using this method, mainly because  \n \n           6    of an inert substance possibly put in by the manufacturer  \n \n           7    to prevent mis-mixing, which I know several drug companies  \n \n           8    will do.  So right now the last time I saw and talked to  \n \n           9    the Director on each of these occasions saying we either  \n \n          10    need to change what we say we're dosing or we will have to  \n \n          11    go back to the original five-gram bottle that was available \n \n          12    when we instituted this procedure.  So right now we're \n \n          13    still improvising.  And he's also having me researching an  \n \n          14    alternate drug if it comes to that. \n \n          15              Pentothal was chosen originally by the engineer  \n \n          16    that designed the machine because it is a long-standing  \n \n          17    drug.  Every physician was familiar with it.  It was  \n \n \n          18    available all over the United States and it was not going  \n \n          19    to be recalled off the market for any reason so it was  \n \n          20    going to be available for a long time.  All the drugs were  \n \n          21    chosen on that criteria rather than some exotic -- and  \n \n          22    again, it was done by an engineer, not by medical  \n \n          23    personnel.  We simply went along with its choices because  \n \n          24    it made sense. \n \n          25    Q    Okay.  So let me step back for one moment, because I  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              11 \n \n \n \n           1    don't have very much background in this.  In previous  \n \n           2    executions when you are preparing a dose of five grams of  \n \n           3    thiopental, how did you accomplish that?  How did you mix  \n \n           4    it? \n \n           5    A    The thiopentothal five-gram bottle is about the size  \n \n           6    of a Coke bottle and it was designed for the  \n \n           7    anesthesiologist to arrive at work in the morning, fill  \n \n           8    this Coke bottle with five grams of pentothal and use 200  \n \n           9    to 500 milligrams per patient for every anesthetic that she  \n \n          10    gave that day.  At the end of the day she could put it in  \n \n          11    the refrigerator with her name and label and use it the  \n \n          12    next day.   \n \n          13              The hospital didn't like this because it allowed  \n \n          14    for poor control.  Left the drug out and so the hospitals  \n \n          15    have gone to this 500-milligram unit dose bottle so they  \n \n          16    can bill patients individually.  And so they sign out a  \n \n          17    specific drug to a specific patient and there's no extra  \n \n          18    left over.  And that's basically what -- the economics of  \n \n          19    the medical use. \n \n          20    Q    I'm sorry, I'm having a little bit of trouble  \n \n          21    following.  So did -- have you given five grams of  \n \n          22    thiopental, prepared five grams for an execution since the  \n \n          23    vial size was reduced to 500 milligrams? \n \n          24    A    No.  And we only used five grams because that's the  \n \n          25    size of the bottle.  Because the DEA requires a separate  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              12 \n \n \n \n           1    disposal log of any drug not used and we would have to  \n \n           2    create disposal records of drugs we didn't use, so we  \n \n           3    simply use the five grams because that's how it was  \n \n           4    supplied. \n \n           5    Q    I see. \n \n           6    A    If it had been a four-gram bottle we would have been  \n \n           7    using four grams.  The original protocol called for one  \n \n           8    gram, and from my experience doing surgery inside prison  \n \n           9    facilities, I was quite aware that one gram in chronic drug  \n \n          10    addicts was an insufficient dose to ensure that they would  \n \n          11    be sedated.  So -- but a two-gram dose would cover 99  \n \n          12    percent of all drug addicts and inmates.  So we arrived --   \n \n          13    initially with the injection machine I specified that it  \n \n          14    had to be changed to two grams because the one gram could  \n \n          15    be insufficient in some cases. \n \n          16    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  I'm just going to introduce another  \n \n          17    exhibit now.   \n \n          18              Have you seen this before, Doctor, this document? \n \n          19    A    This is a page taken from the log that was kept by the  \n \n          20    prison. \n \n          21    Q    Is this -- this reports the chemicals that are used  \n \n          22    and disposed and their amounts in each execution; is that  \n \n          23    correct? \n \n          24    A    It's, I would have to say, an approximation, yes.   \n \n          25    It's the -- the only thing that is significant on this as  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              13 \n \n \n \n           1    far as I'm concerned is the amount of pentothal that is  \n \n           2    used or disposed of.  Potassium and pancuronium are not a  \n \n           3    controlled substance.  The DEA does not care what we do  \n \n           4    with it, but they do want to see if we have a record of  \n \n           5    pentothal used and pentothal disposed, and that's all it's  \n \n           6    for. \n \n           7    Q    I see.  Thank you.  If you could turn -- this has two  \n \n           8    pages on it, right? \n \n           9    A    Yes. \n \n          10    Q    If you could turn to what is the back page, the lower  \n \n          11    page, and if you would just look with me at the entry  \n \n          12    that's dated 3/16.  It says Stanley Hall on it. \n \n          13    A    Yes. \n \n          14    Q    And there does it say -- how much does it record under  \n \n          15    the amount column for sodium pentothal? \n \n          16    A    It says five grams. \n \n          17    Q    And under the vial column? \n \n          18    A    It says ten. \n \n          19    Q    So I guess I'm still having trouble following.  So  \n \n          20    five grams were given to Stanley Hall; is that correct? \n \n          21    A    It shows to be that five grams were taken out of the  \n \n          22    cabinet.  Whether we were able to give him the full five  \n \n \n          23    grams or not, this record is not supposed to show that.   \n \n          24    This is more of an inventory for the prison to keep track  \n \n          25    of drugs. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              14 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    I see.  So you're saying that the five grams may have  \n \n           2    been checked out -- \n \n           3    A    It was checked out, and I noticed when I finally saw  \n \n           4    these records is that sometimes it would show different  \n \n           5    amounts because after we tried to deal with it, I'm sure  \n \n           6    what happened on this instance is we took ten bottles, we  \n \n           7    opened them.  I was unable to mix this.  We show that we  \n \n           8    gave the five grams because we have no provision for  \n \n           9    showing that we disposed of three and gave two, or disposed  \n \n          10    of two and gave three, because this has not been set up  \n \n          11    that way.  We either show we used it all or disposed of it  \n \n          12    all. \n \n          13    Q    I see.  So even though there is no indication on this  \n \n          14    form that any particular amount of pentothal was disposed  \n \n          15    of, you're saying that you may have actually used less than  \n \n          16    five grams in that -- \n \n          17    A    Yes, we may have injected less.  We are still way over  \n \n          18    the amount required to accomplish what our objectives are. \n \n          19    Q    Do you remember how much you may have given during the  \n \n          20    Stanley Hall execution? \n \n          21    A    I don't remember specifically that, no. \n \n          22    Q    Do you have any -- can you speculate as to how much,  \n \n          23    based on your experience in these executions? \n \n          24    A    Well, I need to back up a little bit.  When I was  \n \n          25    involved in the initial executions when the death penalty  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              15 \n \n \n \n           1    was instituted, we were still looking at cyanide and when  \n \n           2    the lethal injection came along, since I was a personal  \n \n           3    friend of the warden's, I was -- I advised him that the  \n \n           4    doses, the rate of administration was too slow with using  \n \n           5    the injection machine.  Therefore, we quickly converted to  \n \n           6    hand injection like they've always used in Texas simply  \n \n           7    because the machine cannot account for differences in flow,  \n \n           8    differences in IVs, rates of administration.  All of the  \n \n           9    problems with lethal injection have nothing to do with the  \n \n \n          10    drugs.  They have to do with the quality of the IV, its \n \n          11    location and how fast the drugs are given.  If you have a  \n \n          12    poor IV, you're going to get a poor result.  All of the bad  \n \n          13    results are from poor IVs, not wrong doses of drugs. \n \n          14              When given two grams, 20 milligrams or so of  \n \n          15    pancuronium and 100 milliequivalents of potassium, 100  \n \n          16    percent of people will die from those injections. \n \n          17    Q    Okay.  And just for the sake of completeness, could  \n \n          18    you look at the entry under the one we were just talking  \n \n          19    about, which is 4/26.  It says Donald Jones.  Do you see  \n \n          20    that one? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    And that also says that five grams were checked out of  \n \n          23    sodium pentothal? \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    And then the vials column, could you describe what you  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              16 \n \n \n \n           1    see there? \n \n           2    A    I see a 10 and I notice now it's marked out.  I would  \n \n           3    never have seen this once the execution was completed, but  \n \n           4    I know now that someone initialed and wrote in that eight  \n \n           5    had been used because apparently they checked the inventory  \n \n           6    and based on their inventory, so we may have taken ten out  \n \n           7    and put two back is the only thing I can speculate on that. \n \n           8    Q    And do you remember how much sodium pentothal you  \n \n           9    actually prepared for that execution? \n \n          10    A    It could not have been over four grams, but whoever  \n \n          11    wrote that in the log, and I can assure you that is not my  \n \n          12    writing, said that I gave five grams.  But again, I don't  \n \n          13    know who wrote that in this log. \n \n          14    Q    I see.  Thank you.  And then on the first page of this  \n \n          15    log, I guess the top page, for 5/17/05, Vernon Brown, would  \n \n          16    your testimony be the same, that five grams was checked out  \n \n          17    but that's not necessarily how much --  \n \n          18    A    It shows five -- ten vials were checked out and ten  \n \n          19    vials confirmed at inventory, so for some reason the ten  \n \n          20    vials were either used or disposed of in this case. \n \n          21    Q    I see.  But do you remember whether you injected five  \n \n          22    grams or not, or prepared five grams? \n \n          23    A    Specifically in this instance, no, I do not remember. \n \n          24    Q    But based on your previous testimony, do you think it  \n \n          25    would have been less than five grams? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              17 \n \n \n \n           1    A    It could have been less than five grams.  My objective  \n \n           2    though is still trying to -- again, the amount is not  \n \n           3    nearly so important as the speed, route, concentration,  \n \n           4    body weight, body fat.  There are many, many other  \n \n           5    factors.  Pre-medication.  All of these have much -- as  \n \n           6    much or more effect as this total dose does. \n \n           7    Q    I see.  Thank you.  So then if you could just take me  \n \n           8    down to the next entry.  I guess it's the entry after the  \n \n           9    next one.  5/30 or 6/30.  \n \n          10    A    Yes. \n \n          11    Q    So if you could just explain to me here.  It looks to  \n \n          12    me it says five grams under the amount and then under vials  \n \n          13    it says six.  \n \n          14    A    That shows six, yes. \n \n          15    Q    So that means that six vials were taken out? \n \n          16    A    Six vials were confirmed at inventory. \n \n          17    Q    And what dose is six vials? \n \n          18    A    Under this system -- again, we have had several  \n \n          19    different drugs.  We have had different doses of  \n \n          20    pancuronium.  We definitely have had different  \n \n          21    concentrations of potassium.  So I don't know at what  \n \n          22    point -- I'm dealing with what I see at the time and what  \n \n          23    I'm required to mix to get this to work.  So whether that  \n \n          24    was a different manufacturer or whether we still had the  \n \n          25    500 milligram -- it's my best recollection we had a similar  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              18 \n \n \n \n           1    type of 500 milligram vial to work with at that time. \n \n \n           2    Q    I see.  And that's a pretty standard vial size; is  \n \n           3    that correct? \n \n           4    A    Until we get a different size, yes. \n \n           5    Q    Okay. \n \n           6    A    Right now nobody is using it, so I don't know if we're  \n \n           7    going to have this available, but we are going to make  \n \n           8    attempts to get that or some other size that we can work  \n \n           9    with. \n \n          10    Q    Okay.  So if you could just -- if we could just go  \n \n          11    back to the Gray execution which we have been talking about  \n \n          12    in this case as an execution in which you prepared five  \n \n          13    grams of thiopental.  \n \n          14    A    Which date was that?  \n \n          15    Q    That was on 10/26/05.  That's the second to the last  \n \n          16    entry in the chemical log.  I was just going to ask you a  \n \n          17    few questions about it. \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    Are you aware that your counsel represented to this  \n \n          20    court on May 17th that five grams of thiopental had been  \n \n          21    prepared and given for each execution, including Mr.  \n \n          22    Gray's? \n \n          23    A    He may have. \n \n          24    Q    Assuming that he made that representation, was that  \n \n          25    accurate? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              19 \n \n \n \n           1    A    By seeing this log, it probably was not accurate. \n \n           2    Q    Do you have any idea why he may have made that  \n \n           3    representation at the time? \n \n           4    A    I can give you a very good reason. \n \n           5    Q    What is that? \n \n           6    A    Well, when I was requested to come back and get  \n \n           7    involved with the execution process, my main objective was  \n \n           8    and I was charged by the Director, they had had a very  \n \n           9    difficult execution in which the inmate took approximately  \n \n          10    25, 30 minutes to expire which caused a flurry in the press  \n \n          11    and embarrassment to the prison.  And my job as a surgeon  \n \n          12    was to ensure that they had an adequate IV. \n \n          13              Secondarily, I was also involved in adjusting the  \n \n          14    doses and keeping -- making sure that these personnel were  \n \n          15    able to give the doses rapidly in the dark by nonmedical  \n \n          16    personnel.  So my objectives were to keep the syringes  \n \n          17    consistent, the labeling consistent, and the timing  \n \n          18    consistent, which is very, very important. \n \n          19              And in that process I was more concentrating on  \n \n          20    how and why the drugs work, because we really had nothing  \n \n          21    to go by.  If you go back in the history of executions, the  \n \n          22    hangman had to refer to a chart for size of rope, length of  \n \n          23    drop, weight of inmate to determine whether a hanging was  \n \n          24    accomplished.  So since there was no other source, and I  \n \n          25    was the only physician involved in any executions, I think  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              20 \n \n \n \n           1    it fell to me to determine if we were doing an adequate  \n \n           2    job. \n \n           3              So under this protocol that I devised for  \n \n           4    nonmedical people to do the injecting, we would inject  \n \n           5    the first syringe of pentothal and the inmate would be  \n \n           6    unconscious in 15 seconds with no cardiovascular  \n \n           7    depression.   \n \n           8              He would then give the pancuronium, which  \n \n           9    requires the heart to still be beating and it has to  \n \n          10    circulate for at least one minute, which is the time a  \n \n          11    nonmedical person has to change syringes.  As this  \n \n          12    circulates, it paralyzes all voluntary muscles.  If you  \n \n          13    give it too quick or your timing is off, you're not going  \n \n          14    to get the right effect.   \n \n          15              Then the two vials, the two ampules of -- or two  \n \n          16    syringes of potassium chloride were sufficient for a person  \n \n          17    under 300 pounds to stop cardiac activity.  Otherwise, you  \n \n          18    have to wait 15 minutes for cardiac activity.  But the  \n \n          19    person will be paralyzed in 15 seconds as the dose goes in  \n \n          20    and the effective heart beat will stop within 15 seconds.   \n \n          21    We wait another minute or two so all electrical activity is  \n \n          22    stopped so no one will question. \n \n          23              So my concern is to follow that type of schedule,  \n \n          24    so I am -- and I'm quite aware in other jurisdictions that  \n \n          25    they would -- they can't get the five gram and they have  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              21 \n \n \n \n           1    also used two grams, and I knew and was figuring at that  \n \n           2    point in time that a five-gram dose might be criticized as  \n \n           3    being excessive.  I knew it wasn't, but again this being  \n \n           4    reviewed by nonmedical personnel who would look for any  \n \n           5    reason to criticize.  So I was totally comfortable with --  \n \n           6    especially when we're dealing with this difficult drug, to  \n \n           7    say -- and by 10/26 I said get out five, I'll give 2.5, and  \n \n           8    again observed that within 15 seconds the patient was --  \n \n           9    the inmate was unconscious, and there was absolutely no  \n \n          10    change in the timing.   \n \n          11              My main objection is, my obligation to the  \n \n          12    director is, he is able to go out and does not have to  \n \n          13    explain to the press why did this happen, why didn't this  \n \n          14    happen.  As long as protocol is followed, death has  \n \n          15    occurred within two to three minutes 100 percent of the  \n \n          16    time and the witnesses are totally unaware even when and  \n \n          17    how the injections are given.  There is no reaction.   \n \n          18    There's no grimacing.  There's no writhing.  There's no  \n \n          19    pain.  There's no feeling whatsoever.  It is a very calm  \n \n \n          20    procedure.  And that's what I'm trying to maintain. \n \n          21    Q    Okay.  Let me just unpack a few things in that  \n \n          22    answer.  Let me just go back for my benefit.  So I think  \n \n          23    you testified that the DOC requested that you come back  \n \n          24    after a particular execution; is that correct? \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              22 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And what was the reason for that? \n \n           2    A    The inmate was a drug addict and they could not get an  \n \n           3    IV line in.  They finally put the needle in his thumb, and  \n \n           4    you cannot give these drugs through the thumb and get the  \n \n           5    result you expect, so it was a prolonged execution which  \n \n           6    caused a lot of embarrassment and it should not have  \n \n           7    happened. \n \n           8    Q    Do you remember which execution that was? \n \n           9    A    I do not.  I was not there. \n \n          10    Q    About what year was that? \n \n          11    A    At least ten years ago, possibly. \n \n          12    Q    And I think you also stated that you devised the  \n \n          13    current procedure as it has to do in the past ten years or  \n \n          14    so since your participation? \n \n          15    A    Again, I was the only physician available anywhere to  \n \n          16    ask about how and what.  No one has any experience with  \n \n \n          17    this drug and currently no one has experience with these  \n \n          18    drugs anymore simply because other drugs are currently  \n \n          19    being used, so I have to be the authority, I guess.  Now I  \n \n          20    am advising other states on what to modify if they have  \n \n          21    problems. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  So you came up with the current procedure? \n \n          23    A    Yes, I did. \n \n          24    Q    Did you consult anybody in the course of doing that? \n \n          25    A    I just said no one else knows anything about this. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              23 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  And so when you devised the  \n \n           2    procedure, I think you said that your goal was to have  \n \n           3    death occur quickly and very -- \n \n           4    A    Painlessly.  With no apparent suffering that the  \n \n           5    public can observe, which they will make the most of. \n \n           6    Q    I see.  Thank you.   \n \n           7              So I think you also said that it has been a  \n \n           8    relatively -- strike that.  I'm sorry.  I think you  \n \n           9    testified that since the vial size of thiopental has  \n \n          10    changed to 500 milligrams it has been consistent that you  \n \n          11    haven't mixed five grams and haven't -- and five grams  \n \n          12    hasn't been injected; is that correct? \n \n          13    A    The total dose to me was insignificant.  My focus was  \n \n          14    on the objective of making it -- and if you look at the  \n \n          15    times of injection and time of -- the amount -- the timing  \n \n          16    of the injections and the time that death occurred, there  \n \n          17    is no visible difference in any of these.  You cannot tell  \n \n          18    from the dose given. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  \n \n          20    A    There's no way to tell. \n \n          21    Q    Sure.  Could you look, please, at your answers to the  \n \n          22    first set of interrogatories.  It's on page 24.  This is  \n \n          23    Interrogatory No. 63. \n \n          24    A    Page 24. \n \n          25    Q    Your answer there is at the bottom of the page.  And  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              24 \n \n \n \n           1    could you just read that answer for me. \n \n           2    A    \"John Doe 1 states that this entry means that 2.5  \n \n           3    grams of sodium pentothal was prepared and administered at  \n \n           4    this execution.  John Doe 1 adds that he/she did not  \n \n           5    initially recall having prepared a smaller dose of sodium  \n \n           6    pentothal than usual at this execution.  John Doe 1 states  \n \n           7    upon further thought and review of the drug log that he/she  \n \n           8    recalls that he/she prepared a smaller dose because it  \n \n           9    comes to his/her attention that other jurisdictions  \n \n          10    considered a dose of sodium pentothal as large as five  \n \n          11    grams to be larger than necessary and John Doe 1, based on  \n \n          12    his/her medical judgment concluded 2.5 grams of sodium  \n \n          13    pentothal was more than adequate.\" \n \n          14    Q    So you stated here that you initially did not recall  \n \n          15    that you prepared a smaller dose; is that correct? \n \n          16    A    Yes. \n \n          17    Q    Was that accurate at the time that this was written? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    Okay.  Do you have any idea why you might not have  \n \n          20    recalled initially that you prepared a smaller dose, given  \n \n          21    that it was relatively consistent that you prepared a  \n \n          22    smaller dose than five grams? \n \n          23    A    I can save you a whole lot of time and offer my  \n \n          24    apologies to the court, but last night I was trying to pay  \n \n          25    my cable bill and I had two hours.  I realized I had copied  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              25 \n \n \n \n           1    my account number by dropping one digit and transposing  \n \n           2    two.  In surgery, that's not important.  But I am dyslexic  \n \n           3    and so I can recall in the operating room specific facts  \n \n           4    and details of operation and function perfectly, but in  \n \n           5    terms of copying one line to another or trying to simply  \n \n           6    copy a phone number or account number I will sometimes  \n \n           7    transpose numbers even when I'm staring at the two  \n \n           8    numbers.  So it's not unusual for me to make mistakes. \n \n           9              But in the operating room where I have no notes,  \n \n          10    no letters, just my mental files which are extensive, this  \n \n          11    -- and I am capable of doing 20 to 25 operations a day when  \n \n          12    I go on these medical missions, without any errors.  But I  \n \n          13    am dyslexic and that is the reason why there are  \n \n          14    inconsistencies in my testimony.  That's why there are  \n \n          15    inconsistencies in what I call drugs.  I can make these  \n \n          16    mistakes, but it's not medically crucial in the type of  \n \n          17    work I do as a surgeon. \n \n          18    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  I'm just trying to get it all  \n \n          19    straight for -- \n \n          20    A    Well, I may contradict myself again. \n \n          21    Q    I understand.  We all do sometimes.  So looking at  \n \n          22    this answer again, it states that you prepared only 2.5  \n \n          23    grams because it had come to your attention that other  \n \n          24    jurisdictions considered a dose of sodium pentothal as  \n \n          25    large as five grams to be larger than necessary and based  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              26 \n \n \n \n           1    on your medical judgment you concluded that 2.5 grams was  \n \n           2    more than adequate.  Is that correct? \n \n           3    A    All other jurisdictions use two grams, period. \n \n           4    Q    And what is the source on which you base that? \n \n           5    A    Direct communication with states involved in  \n \n           6    executions. \n \n           7    Q    Have you communicated with California? \n \n           8    A    Yes. \n \n           9    Q    I think California uses five, or used, but I could be  \n \n          10    wrong on that.  \n \n          11    A    No.  I just talked to them a month ago when they had  \n \n          12    this fiasco. \n \n          13    Q    If I could just ask what you meant by necessary in  \n \n          14    this answer, when you said larger than necessary.  \n \n          15    A    It's adequate, but excessive dose has no bad effects.   \n \n          16    I mean, I could possibly give as much as ten grams, that  \n \n          17    would really be over-kill but it would not really -- the  \n \n          18    drug was chosen because it doesn't cause cardiac vascular  \n \n          19    depression so it means you can give a lot of it and your  \n \n          20    heart will still beat fine.  So that's why this drug was  \n \n          21    given because the muscle relaxant requires heart beat and  \n \n          22    blood pressure to be effective.  If you gave a drug that  \n \n          23    had a chance of stopping the heart beating, of course you  \n \n          24    expect that at an execution, but then you could not give  \n \n          25    the muscle relaxant and the other drugs because they  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              27 \n \n \n \n           1    require a heart beat to circulate and be effective. \n \n           2    Q    When you said 2.5 grams was adequate, you mean  \n \n           3    adequate to cause unconsciousness? \n \n           4    A    One gram will cause 90 percent of the population to be  \n \n           5    unconscious.  The extra gram is for that small percentage  \n \n           6    of drug addicts that had excessive drug use, they produce  \n \n           7    enzymes in the liver that allows them to metabolize  \n \n           8    pentothal at a much more rapid rate. \n \n           9              The problem with all of these drugs is if you  \n \n          10    give the dose and you do not get the effect you need, you  \n \n          11    cannot simply add more drug to get the dose.  You must  \n \n          12    repeat the entire dose.  So if you had chosen a two-gram  \n \n          13    dose just theoretically, and you gave it and a person did  \n \n          14    not become unconscious, rather than giving another 500  \n \n          15    milligrams, most likely you would have to give another full  \n \n          16    two-gram dose.  So we have -- I had to adjust the doses to  \n \n          17    guarantee that we would not have to redose anybody.  So  \n \n          18    that's as much a reason why these numbers were chosen. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  I'm sorry.  And if you gave two grams  \n \n          20    initially why would you then have to give another full two  \n \n          21    grams after that? \n \n          22    A    That's the way all drugs work.  You can't simply add  \n \n          23    more to it to get what you want.  You must repeat the  \n \n          24    entire dose because the body -- as far as the body is  \n \n          25    concerned, that drug is completely gone.  If that person,  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              28 \n \n \n \n           1    you gave him two grams and he's awake, there is no  \n \n           2    pentothal circulating in his body, so you must give another  \n \n           3    full two grams or more if you want an effect.  You can't  \n \n           4    simply add to the dose you have given.  It doesn't  \n \n           5    accumulate. \n \n           6    Q    I see.  And then do you recall that in interrogatory  \n \n           7    answer submitted on May 25th, these were in response to the  \n \n           8    court's interrogatories, you stated that you had prepared  \n \n           9    only 2.5 grams because you had difficulty dissolving more  \n \n          10    than 2.5 grams? \n \n          11    A    Upon seeing the drug log and inventory, yeah, then I  \n \n          12    did remember.  But I have a lot of other things I'm  \n \n          13    involved with and busy with and doing out of the country  \n \n          14    long periods of time.  So, yes.  And one of the problems  \n \n          15    with being dyslexic is you have to be confident in what  \n \n          16    you're doing at the time, so I was fairly confident that I \n \n          17    had mixed five grams.  Then when I saw the drug log and the  \n \n          18    inventory, obviously that is when I made the change.  But  \n \n          19    at that point in time I could remember the details of what  \n \n          20    was involved in that and how I had to try to mix it.  But  \n \n          21    for the most part I would have answered five grams had I  \n \n          22    not seen the log and the inventory and realized they were  \n \n          23    inventory of what was left. \n \n          24    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  So just going back to the Gray  \n \n          25    execution once again.  So you encountered a problem during  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              29 \n \n \n \n           1    the mixing process. \n \n           2    A    As soon as they went to the ten vials, yes.  I go to  \n \n           3    the execution chamber and we're on a time frame.  I have  \n \n           4    minutes to get the drugs ready, minutes to ensure a perfect  \n \n           5    IV.  There's no time to call the drug company at midnight,   \n \n           6    the Director or nursing staff to change.  I am required to  \n \n           7    deal with what I am given and make it come out right and  \n \n           8    make this -- make it happen I guess is best way to say it.   \n \n           9    And since, when I analyzed what I was dealing with, I had  \n \n          10    more than enough to make everything happen according to  \n \n          11    what they were expecting to happen so there was no reason  \n \n          12    to break protocol or call a delay or call the Director or  \n \n          13    something because he was counting on me to keep my end --  \n \n          14    do my part and there was nothing in there that I saw that I  \n \n          15    couldn't do it.  I was able to modify what I was given and  \n \n          16    he was totally unaware that there was any change in dosage,   \n \n          17    because the timing was exactly the same.  And he's almost  \n \n          18    to the point of counting on this predictability and the  \n \n          19    reliability of our method. \n \n          20    Q    So how much pentothal did you set out to mix for the  \n \n          21    Gray execution? \n \n          22    A    Independently I don't remember.  All I have is this  \n \n          23    log of the person that says it came back in inventory.  And  \n \n          24    again, to me, that was not as important as the fact that I  \n \n          25    had enough to effect a loss of consciousness in 15 seconds,  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              30 \n \n \n \n           1    and in fact I do remember when we used only the 2.5 -- and  \n \n           2    that is my handwriting that shows five vials and 2.5 -- the  \n \n           3    inmate was unconscious in 15 seconds and we didn't change  \n \n           4    the order of rotation, size of the syringes or the guards  \n \n           5    that are actually doing the injections. \n \n           6    Q    And do you remember about how long you had to mix the  \n \n           7    drugs? \n \n           8    A    We have about a ten-minute window to make a decision. \n \n           9    Q    Was that the case with the Gray execution as well? \n \n          10    A    It's always. \n \n          11    Q    Okay. \n \n          12    A    We arrive approximately an hour before.  We have to  \n \n          13    prepare the central line tray, get all these drugs from  \n \n          14    their different locked sources, get all the tubing  \n \n \n          15    arranged, the EKG monitoring, the IV tubing, mix all the  \n \n          16    different solutions and flushes, so while we're not rushed  \n \n          17    or stressed we definitely don't waste any time.  Because we  \n \n          18    arrive, we have experience, everybody knows what to do.   \n \n          19    They get the job done.  And for that reason I am the one  \n \n          20    that always mixes the pentothal because it's very difficult  \n \n          21    for someone who is not used to this to accomplish it. \n \n          22    Q    Sure.  So you took about ten minutes during the Gray  \n \n          23    execution.  At the end of that ten minutes were the 2.5  \n \n          24    grams fully dissolved? \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              31 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And on what do you base that? \n \n           2    A    I would not have proceeded had it not.  I would have  \n \n           3    modified, added more solution, transfer it to another  \n \n           4    container, do whatever was required.  Had I had to switch  \n \n           5    to two syringes, then there would be a problem with the  \n \n           6    timing.  Then I would have notified someone and said, hey,  \n \n           7    we're going to have a problem, it's going to take twice as  \n \n           8    long to inject the first drug.  I made the decision that I  \n \n           9    could have sufficient in the same syringe, the timing of  \n \n          10    the execution would be exactly the same, and for the people  \n \n          11    doing the injecting, I didn't have to change their  \n \n          12    understanding of what they had to do, that they had to do  \n \n          13    this one -- the people who do the injections are nonmedical  \n \n          14    and they're in the dark so they have a small flashlight  \n \n          15    that they're able to quickly identify the syringes, make  \n \n          16    the appropriate connections and injections, disconnect,  \n \n          17    clamp the tube, and changing the number of syringes or the  \n \n          18    order of syringes was an unnecessary risk. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  So did you consider using two syringes? \n \n          20    A    No, because I was able to get 2.5 in one syringe. \n \n          21    Q    So you didn't consider it an option to fill two  \n \n          22    syringes each with -- \n \n          23    A    I could have done whatever was needed, but had I  \n \n          24    changed to two syringes, then I would notify somebody that  \n \n          25    this is going to be different.  There was going to be a  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              32 \n \n \n \n           1    delay, because we have to add an extra syringe to the  \n \n           2    process.  Since I was able to get 2.5 -- and I knew two  \n \n           3    grams was more than adequate.  Actually had I gone down to  \n \n           4    one gram I would have notified somebody.  But as long as I  \n \n           5    was within the 2 to 2.5 range and I could get it all in one  \n \n           6    syringe, they didn't want to be bothered, because as far as  \n \n           7    they were concerned this was going to go as smoothly as it  \n \n           8    always had. \n \n           9    Q    So you didn't want to add another syringe because it  \n \n          10    would increase the amount of time to do all the injections? \n \n          11    A    It would confuse the nonmedical people giving the  \n \n          12    injections.  These are nonmedical people.  They're either  \n \n          13    guards, wardens, whatever, whoever they designate to do the  \n \n          14    injecting.  That's the first time probably in their life  \n \n          15    they have picked up a syringe, and it's a Luralock twist  \n \n          16    connector and then they have a separate clamp where they  \n \n          17    have to clamp and unclamp the tubing, so it's a little  \n \n          18    stressful for them to be doing this and still have to do  \n \n          19    these manipulations.  I mean, I can do it in my sleep, but  \n \n          20    for them it's a job.  So I had to keep it -- my objective  \n \n          21    there was keeping it consistent so nonmedical personnel  \n \n          22    could understand what they were doing and it wasn't any  \n \n          23    different than they had seen it done before or they had  \n \n          24    done it before.  That was my priority. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  And so for the Gray execution, how many cc's  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              33 \n \n \n \n           1    of thiopental solution did you end up with? \n \n           2    A    I think I wound up with 40 cc's, from memory, 40 cc's  \n \n           3    of 2.5 grams.  Again, speed and route is as equally  \n \n           4    important as a lot of other things.  So if you have 2.5 and  \n \n           5    you can get it in 40 cc's -- again, there's no way to know  \n \n           6    what the final result is going to be, so I had 2.5 in 40.   \n \n           7    It made no sense to add another 10 cc's of nothing when I  \n \n           8    had it all dissolved in a 40 cc syringe, which basically  \n \n           9    again is one dose, and save time on injecting.  \n \n          10    Q    It's my understanding that the syringe holds  \n \n          11    60 cc's; is that correct? \n \n          12    A    Actually it holds 70, but some are marked 50, some are  \n \n          13    marked 60, so therein lies the confusion of whether we use  \n \n          14    a 50 or 60 or 70 cc syringe.  I could put 70 cc's in all of  \n \n          15    these syringes, but the markings go either to 50 or 60. \n \n          16    Q    I see.  And you didn't consider dissolving more  \n \n          17    thiopental and additional --  \n \n          18    A    No, because we had more than enough.  And by this time  \n \n          19    I was more than -- after several other experiences and also  \n \n          20    dealing with other states and communicating with them, and  \n \n          21    also realizing their responding outside pressures, I was  \n \n          22    entirely comfortable that anything over two grams was more  \n \n          23    than enough for any execution, provided that the inmate did  \n \n          24    not weigh over 300 pounds. \n \n          25    Q    Sure.  And just so that I'm clear, is there also a  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              34 \n \n \n \n \n           1    flush solution with Heparin in each syringe? \n \n           2    A    I do that simply because it guarantees that there will  \n \n           3    be one minute between the injection, so part of that has to  \n \n           4    do with getting a rhythm for the individuals giving the  \n \n           5    injections and it allows the other one to flush and  \n \n           6    circulate sufficiency to have an effect. \n \n           7    Q    I'm sorry.  I am having trouble following.  You say it  \n \n           8    guarantees one minute between injections.  What do you  \n \n           9    mean? \n \n          10    A    It takes a minute to clamp, unclamp, grab another  \n \n          11    syringe, reclamp, unclamp and start injecting.  So, yeah,  \n \n          12    then they inject a flush and then after they flush they  \n \n          13    clamp, unclamp, unhook the syringe, then grab another  \n \n          14    syringe of the next drug and then start injecting that, so  \n \n          15    you can't -- if you rush, you can do it in two and a half  \n \n          16    minutes.  If you take it slowly, you can do it in about  \n \n          17    three minutes.  So there's so many physical clampings and  \n \n          18    unclampings that it takes a set amount of time to do the  \n \n          19    injection.  I take that into consideration when I prepare  \n \n          20    the solution. \n \n          21    Q    So you're aiming for about one minute -- \n \n          22    A    They can inject a syringe in 30 seconds and it takes  \n \n          23    them 30 seconds to reconnect another syringe after they've  \n \n          24    flushed. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  And I'm still having trouble following.  I'm  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              35 \n \n \n \n           1    sorry.  I think there are six syringes total? \n \n           2    A    Just an approximation. \n \n           3    Q    Okay.  So if there's six syringes total, I'm sorry, so  \n \n           4    is it about two syringes per minute, is that right, to get  \n \n           5    it done in three minutes? \n \n           6    A    The guards understand this.  They just simply pick up  \n \n           7    the next syringe and give either half or the entire amount,  \n \n           8    and it takes about three minutes because the time of death,  \n \n           9    as you see from the logs, occurs at three to five minutes  \n \n          10    that we announce and that's the time when electrical  \n \n          11    activity is completely ceased so we have stopped injecting  \n \n          12    for at least two minutes at that time. \n \n          13    Q    I see.  And which syringes do they give half of? \n \n          14    A    One of the flush. \n \n          15    Q    Is there just one flush syringe? \n \n          16    A    Two flush.  \n \n          17    Q    Okay.  Thank you. \n \n          18    A    They are colored differently.  We added a coloring  \n \n          19    agent so they are easy to identify in the dark.  We use a  \n \n          20    methylene blue solution so they are a bright blue color  \n \n          21    even in the darkened room where we're working so they can  \n \n          22    easily identify them.  Even though they're labeled, they  \n \n          23    are also a different color so they know which syringe  \n \n          24    they're injecting even if they can't see the labels. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  And there isn't any methylene blue in the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              36 \n \n \n \n           1    nonflush syringes? \n \n           2    A    All the flush is blue so they can immediately identify  \n \n           3    them in the dark. \n \n           4    Q    And the methylene blue goes in the flush solution with  \n \n           5    Heparin; is that right? \n \n           6    A    Yes.  The Heparin is probably redundant simply because  \n \n           7    the newer catheters we receive are Heparinized catheters  \n \n           8    and probably wouldn't clot for a twelve-hour period if we  \n \n           9    absolutely gave nothing through them.  So it's just an  \n \n          10    extra safety factor.  We don't want anything to go wrong,   \n \n          11    so I have prepared for every possible failure in the way I  \n \n          12    mix the drugs. \n \n          13    Q    Sure.  And when you put the -- some of the flush  \n \n          14    solution with Heparin into the syringes that also has some  \n \n          15    of the chemical in them, does the flush solution at that  \n \n          16    point already have some of the methylene fluid in it, or do  \n \n          17    you add it later? \n \n          18    A    No, the flush solution only goes in after we have  \n \n          19    mixed the other ones so there's no cross-over. \n \n          20    Q    I'm sorry. \n \n          21    A    Only the flush solution is blue.  All the other  \n \n          22    drugs -- the pentothal it yellow.  The pancuronium and  \n \n          23    potassium are clear.  So they can easily identify the  \n \n          24    yellow from the blue from the clear.  And the two clear  \n \n          25    are separated by a blue syringe in between so they can't  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              37 \n \n \n \n           1    get mixed up. \n \n           2    Q    And when you add flush solution to -- I'm sorry.  Let  \n \n           3    me step back.  I think you said earlier, just a bit earlier  \n \n           4    that you add some flush solution with Heparin to the  \n \n           5    syringes containing each of the chemicals; is that correct? \n \n           6    A    No. \n \n           7    Q    I'm sorry.  I think you said a little bit earlier that  \n \n           8    you improvised a method for dissolving the thiopental.   \n \n           9    Could you explain that to me again? \n \n          10    A    Well, it depends on what they hand me, what kind of  \n \n          11    corks, what kind of needles, what kind of glass bottles  \n \n          12    they're in.  I could dump it in an ashtray and pour water  \n \n          13    in it and suck it in a syringe, that would be one way to do  \n \n          14    it, but I'm trying to do it in a sterile fashion and  \n \n          15    medical fashion.  So I'm able to put a needle around the  \n \n          16    plastic stoppers and inject solution into the powder and  \n \n          17    then aspirate it through that same 50 cc syringe.  I'm able  \n \n          18    to do that five times on five separate bottles without  \n \n          19    spilling too much and getting assured that I have 2.5 grams  \n \n          20    in my final solution after I have shaken up those five  \n \n          21    vials. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  And maybe if you state it more simply for me,  \n \n          23    because I'm still not getting it.  So you start out with  \n \n          24    the syringe and a bottle.  And is the thiopental powder in  \n \n          25    the bottle or in the syringe? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              38 \n \n \n \n           1    A    The thiopental is in bottle, but it's not a bottle in  \n \n           2    the sense -- it's a straight cylinder tube with a plastic  \n \n           3    cork that is designed to lock on to another plastic cork  \n \n           4    that contains water.  As the two mix, then it goes out the  \n \n           5    other end and there's a needle built into the system, so if  \n \n           6    they use their system we would be required to break the  \n \n           7    needle off of either five or ten bottles and then connect  \n \n           8    these broken needles individually into our injection system  \n \n           9    and inject each of those individually, it would -- we would  \n \n          10    have 250 -- it would take five to ten minutes for these  \n \n          11    people to inject that as it's prepared, which is three  \n \n          12    times longer than our entire process takes.  It's  \n \n          13    unacceptable. \n \n          14    Q    So what you're just describing was the way that you'd  \n \n          15    have to do it if you used --  \n \n          16    A    Five bottles into -- \n \n          17    Q    I'm sorry.  Let me step back for a minute.  What you  \n \n          18    just described was what you'd have to do if you mix the  \n \n          19    stuff in a way that --  \n \n          20    A    The mixing is -- \n \n          21    Q    I'm sorry.  Just for the sake of the record, if you  \n \n          22    could just wait until I'm finished. \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    Sorry.  So the thiopental mixing process that you just  \n \n          25    described where you have to break the needles off, that's  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              39 \n \n \n \n           1    what you would have to do if you used the mixing process  \n \n           2    that the manufacturers intend in their packaging? \n \n           3    A    Yes.  They contain each about 100 milliliters of  \n \n           4    solution, so the total injection would be five or ten times  \n \n           5    100.  If we injected five grams or 2.5 it would be five  \n \n           6    individual injections.  The problem is this broken needle  \n \n           7    is about one-fourth the size of our tubing.  It does not  \n \n           8    have a locking mechanism so if you inject forcibly you can  \n \n           9    actually blow the connections apart.  It just is totally  \n \n          10    nonacceptable for nonmedical personnel to deal with a drug  \n \n          11    designed for an anesthesiologist on a busy schedule. \n \n          12    Q    Okay.  So what technique have you developed to avoid  \n \n          13    that situation? \n \n          14    A    As far as the inmate -- as far as the guards doing the  \n \n          15    injection, they can't tell there's any difference because  \n \n          16    they still walk in and there are six syringes the same  \n \n          17    color in the same block as it's always been, and there's  \n \n          18    more than adequate drug to accomplish our goal. \n \n          19    Q    Right.  So how do you mix the thiopental then to avoid  \n \n          20    the situation you were just describing where you have to  \n \n          21    break the needles? \n \n          22    A    I simply use one of the 50 cc syringes and go to each  \n \n          23    individual bottle and I start with about 30 cc's in the  \n \n          24    syringe and inject it into each bottle, shake it until it's  \n \n          25    dissolved, withdraw it in the syringe, then inject that  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              40 \n \n \n \n           1    same solution into the next bottle, and do this five  \n \n           2    times.  So it's a little labor-intensive but it can be  \n \n           3    done. \n \n           4    Q    I see.  And how many cc's do you end up with total  \n \n           5    then? \n \n           6    A    In that case, 40 cc's, but I wasn't going to change  \n \n           7    and say oh, I mean to add five because somebody might come  \n \n           8    and look at this later and think I made a mistake.  I knew  \n \n           9    what I was doing. \n \n          10    Q    So you put 30 cc's -- \n \n          11    A    40. \n \n          12    Q    I'm sorry.  \n \n          13    A    40 was in the record there. \n \n          14    Q    I'm sorry. \n \n          15    A    I may have started with 30, but by the time you add  \n \n          16    all the chemicals you may get to 40, so you have to allow  \n \n          17    for the chemicals being dissolved in your solution as you  \n \n          18    go through the process. \n \n          19    Q    Okay.  I understand.  Thank you.  That makes it clear  \n \n          20    for me.   \n \n          21              So you also prepared a 2.5 gram dose for Michael  \n \n          22    Taylor's scheduled execution; is that correct? \n \n          23    A    Yes, I think that's what it says. \n \n          24    Q    That's just on the log, the entry, 2/1/06.  \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              41 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Do you recall stating in an interrogatory answer, this  \n \n           2    is in your responses to the court's interrogatories, it's  \n \n           3    number 5 on page 6, do you remember stating that you used  \n \n           4    2.5 grams for Mr. Taylor because you were aware that 2.5  \n \n           5    grams had been adequate in Mr. Gray's execution? \n \n           6    A    I was aware that two grams has been adequate all over  \n \n           7    the country. \n \n           8    Q    Okay.  Let's just look at your answer for -- \n \n           9    A    I know that's what my answer was.  Yes, that was the  \n \n          10    best answer I could give at the time. \n \n          11    Q    So when you said that the 2.5 was adequate for  \n \n          12    Mr. Gray, on what did you base -- what facts or experience  \n \n          13    did you base your judgment that it was adequate? \n \n          14    A    Complete loss of consciousness in 15 seconds after the  \n \n          15    injection started.   \n \n          16    Q    Did you monitor Mr. Gray's anesthetic depth during the  \n \n          17    execution? \n \n          18    A    I monitor -- the only thing that can be monitored is  \n \n          19    facial expression, and you can judge when the effect of the  \n \n          20    drug is accomplished, and that can be seen from across a  \n \n          21    room through a window.  And when that effect occurs then I  \n \n          22    know the inmate is unconscious.  And there's absolutely no  \n \n          23    difference in any of these injections.  Again, because the  \n \n          24    tubing is eight, nine feet long, by the time the 15 seconds  \n \n          25    I know that inmate may have only gotten 500 milligrams of  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              42 \n \n \n \n           1    injection.  That's the other reason we use -- allow  \n \n           2    premedication is because a calm, relaxed individual  \n \n           3    requires a lot less drug than an agitated individual.  And  \n \n           4    as a physician I am there to make sure this man is in a  \n \n           5    calm state and that he has an IV injected -- inserted  \n \n           6    completely painlessly that will not fail during the course  \n \n           7    of the procedure.  \n \n           8              MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry.  Would you read that  \n \n           9    answer back for me?  \n \n          10    A    I can't.   \n \n          11              (The prior answer read back by the reporter.) \n \n          12    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So you said that you can see that --  \n \n          13    an inmate's facial expression from where you stand? \n \n          14    A    Yes.  That's the only thing any anesthesiologist uses  \n \n          15    in the course of inducing a person when pentothal was still  \n \n          16    used, was you simply start injecting, look at the face, and  \n \n          17    again, it's difficult to describe, but I can tell instantly  \n \n          18    when the pentothal has taken effect.  And in medical  \n \n          19    practice the instant the pentothal has taken effect they  \n \n          20    gave absolutely no more because then they move on to the  \n \n          21    actual anesthesia which has to be started before the  \n \n          22    pentothal wears off. \n \n          23              In our case, we're just worried about when he  \n \n          24    reaches that point, because there is a phenomena with  \n \n          25    pentothal where if it's given to some agitated individuals  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              43 \n \n \n \n           1    they can in fact have a seizure or, you know, they'll say  \n \n           2    this isn't working because they're agitated.  And there is  \n \n           3    an effect of pentothal that will cause agitation or  \n \n           4    seizures. \n \n           5              So once that facial expression change has  \n \n           6    occurred, we know we're out of the danger zone and that  \n \n           7    this agitation or seizure will not occur. \n \n           8    Q    And just so I'm clear, do you stand in the execution  \n \n           9    room?  Do you stand behind the two John Does who are  \n \n          10    injecting the drugs? \n \n          11    A    Yes.  In case they have a question, problem, I am  \n \n          12    there to give advice.  I'm not there to inject.  But I can  \n \n          13    see the side of the inmate's face and that's all  \n \n          14    sufficient.  He goes from looking toward witnesses to  \n \n          15    looking around the room to a completely relaxed facial  \n \n          16    expression. \n \n          17    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  Just to go back to the mixing the  \n \n          18    thiopental.  I think you briefly stated before why you  \n \n          19    thought you might have had trouble mixing the thiopental.   \n \n          20    Could you explain for me why again why you think that might  \n \n          21    be? \n \n          22    A    Some companies, because of their suspecting that  \n \n          23    somebody will try to mix the wrong dose or give the wrong  \n \n          24    dose, I know that certain drugs -- this drug is mixed with  \n \n          25    two containers so you cannot mix it any other way  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              44 \n \n \n \n           1    theoretically, but also some medications have an inert  \n \n           2    compound in or a secondary compound to prevent improper  \n \n           3    dose.  The case in point being some cough medicines that  \n \n           4    have a small amount of epicate (phonetic spelling) that if  \n \n           5    you take too much cough medicine you will get enough  \n \n           6    epicate to cause vomiting.  But if you take the right dose,  \n \n           7    you get the right amount of cough medicine but not enough  \n \n           8    epicate to cause vomiting.  So there are many things in  \n \n           9    drugs that are used by the industry, and I suspect there  \n \n          10    was possibly an inert compound added to prevent improper  \n \n          11    mixing of these drugs. \n \n          12              Again, I am aware now that all of the pentothal  \n \n          13    we have has expired so I have no clue who is going to  \n \n          14    supply it, if we can get the next pentothal, if we have  \n \n          15    another execution.  So I will have to review this with the  \n \n          16    Director to find out what is available or what he thinks we  \n \n          17    should do about changing it if we can no longer get this  \n \n          18    pentothal.  I'm hoping we can still get it at least in one  \n \n          19    form or another. \n \n          20    Q    You mean you might not be able to get thiopental at  \n \n          21    all? \n \n          22    A    It's always going to be available somewhere.  It may  \n \n          23    be more difficult or it may come in these doses that is  \n \n          24    very difficult for us to manage, but pentothal is like  \n \n          25    aspirin, it's never going to go away because it's part of a  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              45 \n \n \n \n           1    compound of drug that is -- well, I can tell you all  \n \n           2    barbiturates, and it's a member of the barbiturate family  \n \n           3    of controlled drugs, and there's nothing in it that can  \n \n           4    cause heart attack, lung cancer, like these newer cosmetic  \n \n           5    -- newer drugs that are coming out that have these horrible  \n \n           6    side effects.  Pentothal is not going to be taken off the  \n \n           7    market, so there's no reason for it to be removed from the  \n \n           8    market.  It just may be more difficult to find.   \n \n           9    Q    I see.  And just to go back to your earlier answer for  \n \n          10    a minute.  Are there any other things you can think of that  \n \n          11    might account for the trouble mixing the total five grams? \n \n          12    A    They may have a special compound in their solution  \n \n          13    which I can't get out of the bottle that allows for more  \n \n          14    rapid dissolution.  Whether I use a saline or water  \n \n          15    solution should make no difference on this, but they may  \n \n          16    have a compound in their solution that allows it to  \n \n          17    dissolve more easily, but I can't get theirs out of the  \n \n          18    bottle without actually breaking glass. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  And did you ever consider the possibility that  \n \n          20    the thiopental might be defective? \n \n          21    A    No.  It's a compound.  It's like salt.  There's -- or  \n \n          22    sugar.  It's a chemical.  There's nothing -- it  \n \n          23    deteriorates after it's been mixed, but there is nothing in  \n \n          24    pentothal that can out-date as long as it's in powder. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  So it's pretty stable? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              46 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Very. \n \n           2    Q    Is it stable even if, say, air gets to it or something  \n \n           3    like that? \n \n           4    A    Yes.  It's just what it becomes -- in the liquid form  \n \n           5    it does lose some potency, and again, it would be after a  \n \n           6    week or two, because I know they would mix -- they would  \n \n           7    usually mix it at the hospital the first of the week and  \n \n           8    use it all week with no problems, and if there were any  \n \n           9    left they would simply mix a new bottle the next week.  So  \n \n          10    it loses potency when it's in liquid solution.  And when  \n \n          11    it's over that long period of time in a multi-dose vial  \n \n          12    after it's been open for a week, there's a possibility --  \n \n          13    you are more worried about contamination of the solution  \n \n          14    rather than deterioration of the product. \n \n          15    Q    I see.  And I think you also said that you might  \n \n          16    consider using other drugs if you can't get thiopental.   \n \n          17    What other drugs might you consider? \n \n          18    A    Well, the most common use, the reason pentothal is no  \n \n          19    longer available is because everyone -- I have three, four  \n \n          20    anesthesiologists in my immediate family, they use Diprovan  \n \n          21    now as their No. 1 drug for inductions and even some  \n \n          22    anesthesia.  Diprovan though requires a continuous  \n \n          23    infusion.  In other words, it has been to be given  \n \n          24    constantly.  It looks like milk hanging in a bottle.  It  \n \n          25    looks like milk in the IV tubing as it's going into the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              47 \n \n \n \n           1    individual.  The milk runs in their arm.  The instant that  \n \n           2    milk disappears from the IV the individual getting it will  \n \n           3    sit up and walk out of the room with no side effects.  It's  \n \n           4    instant recovery.  The anesthesiologists love it, but we  \n \n           5    can't use it.   \n \n           6    Q    Is that primarily an induction agent? \n \n           7    A    That's the No. 1 induction agent today. \n \n           8    Q    So it's not used -- is it used for maintaining  \n \n           9    anesthesia too? \n \n          10    A    Only in short cases.  They would use it for my cases  \n \n          11    because I can do most operations in ten minutes, but for  \n \n          12    most surgeons they would use other agents. \n \n          13    Q    Are there any other drugs you can think of? \n \n          14    A    According to all of my family anesthesiologists,  \n \n \n          15    really, no.  It's still going to be down to a barbiturate.   \n \n          16    If not pentothal, one of its other anologs which have a  \n \n          17    slower onset and a longer duration.  But the pentothal  \n \n          18    we're using has the most rapid onset of all, but it's also  \n \n          19    metabolized quicker.  We're talking 15 to 20 minutes as  \n \n          20    opposed to the long-acting ones that may last up to an  \n \n          21    hour, like sleeping pills.  The barbiturates that are used  \n \n          22    for sleeping last six to eight hours, but they take longer  \n \n          23    to take effect and some of them can't be given IV.   \n \n          24    Pentothal can be given IV. \n \n          25    Q    So pentothal is preferable because it takes effect  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              48 \n \n \n \n           1    more quickly? \n \n           2    A    Yes.  It's the fastest, but it isn't good in an oral  \n \n           3    form.  If you took it by mouth, it would -- I think it has  \n \n           4    no effect.  It's eaten up by the acid in the stomach so it  \n \n           5    has no effect if given orally, so it has to be given IV. \n \n           6    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  I'd just like to look at another  \n \n           7    one of your interrogatory answers now.  It's in the third  \n \n           8    set which are the court's interrogatories.  It's No. 5 --  \n \n           9    the answer on 22 begins on page 5.  \n \n          10    A    Page 5?  \n \n          11    Q    The top of page 5.  \n \n          12    A    Rate of infusion is at the top of the page? \n \n          13    Q    Yes, that's correct.  So you said, \"The rate of  \n \n          14    infusion and concentration of the dose ensured that 2.5  \n \n          15    grams was more than sufficient to make the offender  \n \n          16    unconscious.\"  So just because I don't have any medical  \n \n          17    training or anything, could you define rate of infusion for  \n \n          18    me? \n \n          19    A    The speed with which the drug is given.  So if I  \n \n          20    dilute it in a larger volume the same amount of drug, it  \n \n          21    takes longer to give it.  The speed that the drug is given  \n \n          22    has a significant effect on its -- the way it reacts in the  \n \n          23    body.  If you give it in an IV in the arm, because a lot of  \n \n          24    these drugs are concentrated, they will induce spasm.  So  \n \n          25    what you think you're giving might be leaking around the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              49 \n \n \n \n           1    needle, may be slowly getting up the arm, so you can't give  \n \n           2    it as fast.  And the problem compounds itself because the  \n \n           3    slower you give it the more the body metabolizes it, so  \n \n           4    it's not a one-to-one ratio.  So if you give it in 30  \n \n           5    seconds you get one result, but if you give it over two \n \n           6    minutes, the result is completely different.  At some point  \n \n           7    eventually they're all going to be the same, but the speed  \n \n           8    with which the individual goes to sleep directly affects  \n \n           9    how fast -- is affected by how fast the drug is given. \n \n          10    Q    Okay.  And what is the rate of infusion for an  \n \n          11    execution? \n \n          12    A    Because of the length of the tubing and the size of  \n \n          13    the syringe you can only inject it -- you can't inject it  \n \n          14    any faster than a certain rate.  The big heavy syringes  \n \n          15    just don't allow you to go any faster.  So if they push  \n \n          16    harder, it doesn't go any faster.  You can go maybe slower,  \n \n          17    but the tubing and the syringe act as a monitor to the way  \n \n          18    the injection is given.  If they try hard, they can do it  \n \n          19    in 15 seconds.  If they do it slow, it takes 20 seconds.   \n \n          20    So the size of the syringe, the length of the tubing has a  \n \n          21    serious -- an effect on the speed of this injection, the  \n \n          22    way I've got it set up. \n \n          23              The size of the needle at the other end is going  \n \n          24    to have equally an effect because that's what happened in  \n \n          25    the case of Ohio, Texas, other states where they have these  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              50 \n \n \n \n           1    bad results.  They have a small needle in the arm so no  \n \n           2    matter how hard you push that 50 cc syringe it's going to  \n \n           3    take you three minutes to give the drug and you will not  \n \n           4    get the effect you expect.  You'll get an agitated inmate  \n \n           5    who is agitated.  \n \n           6    Q    So if you had to put a number on the rate of infusion,  \n \n           7    just if you were going to do calculations here -- \n \n           8    A    30 seconds. \n \n           9    Q    Okay.  So the rate of infusion is 30 seconds? \n \n          10    A    I would estimate, yes. \n \n          11    Q    Okay.  And what was the concentration of the  \n \n \n          12    thiopental solution for Mr. Gray? \n \n          13    A    In his case we had 2.5 in 40 cc's I think, if I'm  \n \n          14    thinking of the right one. \n \n          15    Q    Yeah, those figures sound right to me.   \n \n          16              I'm sorry.  Just because I can't see, are you  \n \n          17    doing a calculation or --  \n \n          18    A    Oh, no.  I'm waiting for the next question. \n \n          19    Q    I'm sorry.  So you're saying the concentration would  \n \n          20    be 2.5? \n \n          21    A    I'm dyslexic.  I cannot figure those things out.  I  \n \n          22    can't.  I have to rely on the nurse.  When I say give me  \n \n          23    the first med, she hands me the syringe.  \n \n          24    Q    I'm sorry.  So when you were mixing the drugs for  \n \n          25    Mr. Gray and you said that the rate of infusion and the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              51 \n \n \n \n           1    concentration made it -- made the 2.5 grams sufficient, is  \n \n           2    that a calculation that you would do at the time? \n \n           3    A    No, no, that's just judgment.  As long as I have 2.5  \n \n           4    grams, whether I had it in 30 or 60, the priority was  \n \n           5    whether it was in one syringe or two.  So once I had 2.5  \n \n           6    grams and I knew from previous mixing that I could possibly  \n \n           7    do it so I started with the smaller amount so when I was  \n \n           8    finished I had 2.5 grams in 40 cc's rather than 50 or 60  \n \n           9    cc's.  And to my understanding of what our objective was,  \n \n          10    that was better than just adding more inert solution to the  \n \n          11    mix to dilute the drug. \n \n          12              When we're giving it through a central line, a  \n \n          13    fast-flowing central vessel, the concentration is not a  \n \n          14    problem.  It's only when you're giving it through a  \n \n          15    peripheral IV does the concentration affect the rate of  \n \n          16    infusion. \n \n          17    Q    I see.  So the concentration can affect the rate of  \n \n          18    infusion? \n \n          19    A    If you're not using a central line, yes. \n \n          20    Q    Does the concentration make it slower? \n \n          21    A    Yes, because it will put -- it will -- the solution  \n \n          22    becomes thicker, and also it puts a spasm in the vessel  \n \n          23    that prevents it from flowing -- it has to flow  through  \n \n          24    the vessels to a major vessel before it has any effect, and  \n \n          25    that can take a number of seconds, whereas when it's in a  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              52 \n \n \n \n           1    central line, our central line is positioned inches from  \n \n           2    the heart so the minute that injection is in it's  \n \n           3    immediately in the heart and distributed to the entire  \n \n           4    body. \n \n           5    Q    I see.  So when you said that the rate of infusion and  \n \n           6    concentration were more than sufficient -- I'm sorry.  The  \n \n           7    rate of infusion and the concentration of the dose ensured  \n \n           8    that the 2.5 grams was more than sufficient, you're relying  \n \n           9    on your medical judgment? \n \n          10    A    Yes. \n \n          11    Q    Were there any other factors that you considered in  \n \n          12    considering whether the thiopental was sufficient? \n \n          13    A    No, because I knew we were dealing with a central line  \n \n          14    and it was going to be given rapidly so I didn't have to  \n \n          15    worry about diluting it up to a larger amount.  I mean, you  \n \n          16    eliminate all of those calculations by using a large core  \n \n          17    central line catheter and you're not going to have to worry  \n \n          18    about extravasation, leakage, any of those factors.  Or  \n \n          19    pain of injection.  The inmate has no inkling that these  \n \n          20    drugs are being injected.  Absolutely no sensation other  \n \n          21    than he gets sleepy. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  And for the next execution that occurs,  \n \n          23    assuming that you participate, what dose of thiopental do  \n \n          24    you think you'll prepare? \n \n          25    A    I will recommend 2.5 if we have to deal with the same  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              53 \n \n \n \n           1    equipment that we're dealing with.  If we get another  \n \n           2    supplier that supplies us one-gram bottles in premixed or  \n \n           3    mixable in 25 cc's each, then I will recommend to the  \n \n           4    Director we use the two-gram, which is a more convenient  \n \n           5    way of mixing. \n \n           6              It's only when we step outside the parameter of  \n \n           7    2 to 2.5 in one 50 cc syringe is there a serious change  \n \n           8    occurring as far as I'm concerned, or that I would have to  \n \n           9    discuss this with the Director who relies on my judgment to  \n \n          10    make this happen. \n \n          11    Q    Okay.  So just to go back for a minute, you said that  \n \n          12    if you found a supplier who supplied it in one-gram bottles  \n \n          13    you would recommend two grams; is that what you said? \n \n          14    A    Yes. \n \n          15    Q    So a total of two-gram dose? \n \n          16    A    That would be more consistent with national standards  \n \n          17    as opposed to using three bottles and a three-gram dose.   \n \n          18    But again, that's just -- as long as you're over two grams  \n \n          19    you're going to have 100 percent unconsciousness after 15  \n \n          20    seconds.  It's only -- the one-gram dose is only  \n \n          21    insufficient when you have a serious drug addict or obesity  \n \n          22    over 300 pounds. \n \n          23    Q    I see.  So for a normal inmate you could give one  \n \n          24    gram? \n \n          25    A    For most -- for everybody sitting in this room I  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              54 \n \n \n \n           1    could give you 500 milligrams and everybody would be  \n \n           2    unconscious.  500 is enough.  That's why the new doses come  \n \n           3    in 500-gram bottles.  That's -- the standard dose is 500. \n \n           4    Q    When you say that 500 is enough, it's enough to render  \n \n           5    somebody unconscious; is that what you mean? \n \n           6    A    In order to proceed with an anesthetic.  This is not  \n \n           7    the execution setting.  This is giving you an anesthetic.   \n \n           8    If you receive 500 milligrams of IV pentothal, you would be  \n \n           9    asleep and unconscious, but still breathing. \n \n          10    Q    Would you be unconscious to the point where somebody  \n \n          11    could perform surgery on you? \n \n          12    A    No, it's not an anesthetic.  It's a sedative.  It has  \n \n          13    no anesthesia properties.  Surgery takes a long time and it  \n \n          14    wears off almost within minutes, so you wouldn't even have  \n \n          15    time to get ready to do surgery. \n \n          16    Q    I see.  So you wouldn't use thiopental alone if you  \n \n          17    were doing surgery? \n \n          18    A    Never.  It's not an anesthetic.  It's a sedative. \n \n          19    Q    But for an execution -- \n \n          20    A    It's a sedative. \n \n          21    Q    Would a five-gram dose be sufficient for an execution? \n \n          22    A    One gram would probably be sufficient if he wasn't a  \n \n          23    serious drug addict or a certain amount of body fat.  But  \n \n          24    we're not in a position to change once we have started, so  \n \n          25    my recommendation to the Director was to -- and the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              55 \n \n \n \n           1    recommendation of other states, is to go two-gram minimum  \n \n           2    to ensure they're going to get the 99th percentile, and if  \n \n           3    every state agrees that they're over three, 400 pounds they  \n \n           4    are going to have to go to three grams. \n \n           5    Q    Would one gram be sufficient for you to do a quick  \n \n           6    surgery on somebody? \n \n           7    A    No, never; it never works. \n \n           8    Q    So would the person wake up? \n \n           9    A    If I cut him, yes.  They're not -- it has no  \n \n          10    anesthesia.  It's a sedative. \n \n          11    Q    I see.  So -- \n \n          12    A    Anesthesia is what keeps you from feeling pain.   \n \n          13    Pentothal is just a sedation like a sleeping pill.  If I  \n \n          14    operated on you when you were asleep, you would wake up  \n \n          15    immediately. \n \n          16    Q    Okay.  So the thiopental would put you to sleep and  \n \n          17    then if you felt something painful you would then wake up? \n \n          18    A    If I -- at a certain point in time you would respond.   \n \n          19    Again it depends on the level.  When you go through the  \n \n          20    stages of induction, which is what we're dealing with with  \n \n          21    pentothal, you go through them, but you don't immediately  \n \n          22    wake up.  You must go back through the stages that got you  \n \n          23    through that stage, if that makes sense.  In other words,  \n \n          24    you can't go to a level of total unconsciousness to  \n \n          25    immediately wake up and talking.  You have to come back  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              56 \n \n \n \n           1    through grogginess and the other stages that you went  \n \n           2    through going to that.  Diprovan avoids all that, and  \n \n           3    that's why some people stopped using pentothal and went to  \n \n           4    Diprovan because you immediately wake up after the drug is  \n \n           5    stopped with no side effects and no residual. \n \n           6    Q    So when you give thiopental for an execution, is the  \n \n           7    goal total unconsciousness? \n \n           8    A    The goal is to render the inmate unconscious so the  \n \n           9    paralysis agent can be given and then the drug given to  \n \n          10    stop the heart beat.  Again, you're arguing how many grains  \n \n          11    of powder do you put in a bullet if we were using a firing  \n \n          12    squad.  The amount of powder in the bullet has very little  \n \n          13    affect on the effect of the bullet.   \n \n          14    Q    I see.  So if you use pentothal to induce total  \n \n          15    unconsciousness because it's not an anesthetic, then  \n \n          16    somebody could still wake up if you -- \n \n          17    A    Given sufficient time, it's reversible, yes. \n \n          18    Q    Okay.   \n \n          19    A    In 15 minutes he would probably wake up. \n \n          20    Q    Okay.  Let me step back.  I think you said that  \n \n          21    thiopental has no anesthetic properties? \n \n          22    A    That's correct. \n \n          23    Q    So then if somebody is put to sleep with thiopental,  \n \n          24    then they might -- then if you cut them, they'd wake up? \n \n          25    A    Depending on how much pentothal they had and how long  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              57 \n \n \n \n           1    you waited after the injection.  But still that point has  \n \n           2    nothing to do with executions. \n \n           3    Q    And why is that? \n \n           4    A    We don't inflict any pain ever. \n \n           5    Q    I see. \n \n           6    A    It's all done through a central line.  They can't feel  \n \n           7    anything. \n \n           8    Q    When you say that, could you just sort of explain that  \n \n           9    to me? \n \n          10    A    If you were injecting through the arm they might  \n \n          11    theoretically feel the potassium if they were not  \n \n          12    paralyzed, but by using a central line -- all the  \n \n          13    complications of lethal injection have to do with how  \n \n          14    the IV is put in, not with the drugs. \n \n          15    Q    So when potassium is injected into the femoral vein,  \n \n          16    it doesn't hurt? \n \n          17    A    Absolutely not. \n \n          18    Q    What do you base that on, that conclusion? \n \n          19    A    It's impossible.  It's injected into a major  \n \n          20    free-flowing vessel.  The only way it hurts is by causing  \n \n          21    spasm in a vessel in your hand or in your arm or in your  \n \n          22    leg.  Once it passes through the arm or leg into a central  \n \n          23    high-volume vessel, it's completely painless. \n \n          24    Q    I see.  So I'm just having a little bit of trouble  \n \n          25    following because of my lack of medical background.  So I  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              58 \n \n \n \n           1    think you said two things.  One is that it isn't painful in  \n \n           2    the femoral vein because that vein doesn't spasm? \n \n           3    A    Absolutely not.  It's a high-flowing vessel.  It's not  \n \n           4    a cutaneous vessel.  Cutaneous vessels on your skin must  \n \n \n           5    have muscles in them to constrict.  If you accidentally cut  \n \n           6    yourself -- peripheral vessels have to contract and stop  \n \n           7    bleeding or else everybody when they cut their finger would  \n \n           8    bleed to death.  Central veins do not need to constrict so  \n \n           9    they have no muscle in it so you do not feel a spasm and  \n \n          10    they cannot react to drugs as they are being injected.   \n \n          11    Plus the drug is diluted instantly.  The amount of blood  \n \n          12    flowing through the interior vena cava amounts to a quart  \n \n          13    every two seconds, so it's instantly dissolved. \n \n          14    Q    And what is the concentration of the potassium that  \n \n \n          15    you inject? \n \n          16    A    Higher than can be given through a peripheral IV.   \n \n          17    We're using a drug that was designed -- a bottle that was  \n \n          18    designed to be put in a quart of IV fluid in order to  \n \n          19    adjust electrolyte imbalance on people that are on diuretic  \n \n          20    overdose.  They eliminate so much potassium, and potassium  \n \n          21    allows for stability of the heart beat.  So we will put one  \n \n          22    of those bottles of the six that we use in a large IV  \n \n          23    solution and give it gradually over six hours to patients  \n \n          24    in ICU.  We can't give it any faster than that in the  \n \n          25    clinical setting. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              59 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    If you'll look at the chemical log again, which is  \n \n           2    Exhibit No. 4, just looking at the first line on the first  \n \n           3    page, for the potassium chloride it says amount, 120. \n \n           4    A    Yes.  \n \n           5    Q    Is that 120 milliequivalents? \n \n           6    A    I have been informed that the new solution, and we  \n \n           7    have been through three, has two milliequivalents per ML,  \n \n           8    so -- and I could stand corrected, but it's probably 240  \n \n           9    that we are using right now. \n \n          10    Q    I see.  So you're using 240 milliequivalents in 120  \n \n          11    cc's or milliliters; is that correct? \n \n          12    A    Yes.  Again, we're trying to maintain the continuity  \n \n          13    for the people doing the injection.  Since they're  \n \n          14    nonmedical people, they want to come in and see those six  \n \n          15    syringes just as they saw them the previous time because  \n \n          16    they don't want to make any mistakes. \n \n          17    Q    I see.  \n \n          18    A    I could probably get by with one syringe if we always  \n \n          19    knew we were having that 240, but it's much easier for the  \n \n          20    other people to see this standardized tray with those  \n \n          21    syringes as they remember them from the previous time. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  So there was a point where the dose was not  \n \n          23    240.  It was 120? \n \n          24    A    It was 120, and again this log is really -- people  \n \n          25    writing on the previous lines, and as I stated before I'm  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              60 \n \n \n \n           1    incapable of copying one line to the next consistently, but  \n \n           2    I try. \n \n           3    Q    So when the dose is 120, you also used two syringes to  \n \n           4    keep it consistent? \n \n           5    A    Always two syringes.  Now, we did have one individual  \n \n           6    that I do remember when we were going through this where I  \n \n           7    recommended, because of the size of the inmate and because  \n \n           8    of what I previously stated, if we do not get the heart to  \n \n           9    stop on two syringes we then have to give two plus, meaning  \n \n          10    three syringes, so we'd have to give a total of five.  It  \n \n \n          11    was much easier to have three syringes available and give  \n \n          12    it to ensure -- and the factor is called fat absorption,  \n \n          13    that the fat absorption of the potassium would not use up  \n \n          14    enough of the drug that the heart would stop at an \n \n          15    appropriate time.  \n \n          16              So in one instance I recommended and did not  \n \n          17    check or tell anybody because it was based on medical  \n \n          18    dosage that this person would require a third syringe of  \n \n          19    potassium.  And I don't remember whether it's even in this  \n \n          20    log, but one instance, because of the obesity of the  \n \n          21    inmate.  And again, Texas, California, those places, they  \n \n          22    have no one that can make those decisions, so if they had  \n \n          23    someone of that weight, they might have had a serious  \n \n          24    problem.  But we do this on an individual basis and for  \n \n          25    that reason I recommended that we use more so we would not  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              61 \n \n \n \n           1    be sitting there for 30 minutes waiting for the electrical  \n \n           2    activity to stop. \n \n           3    Q    I see.  So just going back to the potassium in the  \n \n           4    femoral vein, so if -- the concentration is I guess two  \n \n           5    milliequivalents per milliliter; is that correct? \n \n           6    A    Right. \n \n           7    Q    And that concentration won't hurt in the femoral vein? \n \n           8    A    Absolutely not.  It's not actually going in the  \n \n           9    femoral vein.  We use the femoral vein to insert a catheter  \n \n          10    that I think is about 16 inches long, so actually from the  \n \n          11    femoral vein if you measure up to your xiphoid which would  \n \n          12    mean it's about two inches from the heart, so the catheter  \n \n          13    is almost in the heart when -- so the drug is directly  \n \n          14    injected below the heart as it enters. \n \n          15    Q    I see.  And what do you base your conclusion that it's  \n \n          16    not going to hurt at all on? \n \n          17    A    The same as before.  It's not a peripheral vein.  It's  \n \n          18    diluted so rapidly in the heart. \n \n          19    Q    Are there any calculations that go with that? \n \n          20    A    Heavens, no. \n \n          21    Q    So you don't have to calculate the concentration? \n \n          22    A    No. \n \n          23    Q    I see.  Okay.  I think you said in one of your  \n \n          24    interrogatories, this was in the plaintiff's supplemental  \n \n          25    interrogatories, you don't have to turn to it unless you  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              62 \n \n \n \n           1    don't remember, but I think you stated you have had  \n \n           2    conversations with previous Directors of Corrections  \n \n           3    regarding your authority to make changes to the execution  \n \n           4    process? \n \n           5    A    Well, we don't exist in a vacuum.  I mean, we will, as  \n \n           6    we come in for the execution, basically I go to the  \n \n           7    Director's office.  The Director is usually always there,  \n \n           8    plus his assistants, and so we will visit about this and he  \n \n           9    will ask are there problems, do you anticipate problems,  \n \n          10    have you had problems, in the course of that conversation.   \n \n          11    So there is some discussion every time there is a execution  \n \n          12    if I anticipate problems or if I have adequate supplies or  \n \n          13    what do we need or what I would recommend to be done in the  \n \n          14    future, so, yeah, we do discuss these. \n \n          15    Q    And do some of these discussions involve the scope of  \n \n          16    your authority and context of the procedure? \n \n          17    A    No.  He's relying on me to keep him looking good, to  \n \n          18    use his terms directly, so he does not have to go out and  \n \n          19    explain why we made a mistake or we may have a problem or  \n \n          20    why it didn't go smoothly or why a clamp was left on the  \n \n          21    tubing and we had to close the curtains and make an  \n \n          22    adjustment.  That will not happen when I'm there. \n \n          23    Q    So your understanding is that you have the authority  \n \n          24    to do whatever is necessary during the execution to ensure  \n \n          25    that it goes smoothly? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              63 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes.  And if I can't get it done, I will contact him  \n \n           2    and he will make sure what I request is done.  But so far  \n \n           3    we have -- we have anticipated every possible problem with  \n \n           4    this dosage, with these catheters, with these solutions,   \n \n           5    and we see no reason to make any significant change other  \n \n           6    than drugs not available or, you know, the catheters that  \n \n           7    we use, the IV tubing, all that is current state of the  \n \n           8    art. \n \n           9    Q    I see.  So it's your understanding from previous  \n \n          10    directors that you have the authority that is necessary to  \n \n          11    make the execution go smoothly? \n \n          12    A    They're relying on me to make changes or suggestions  \n \n          13    that they will agree with if I think a change needs to be  \n \n          14    made.  They're relying on my medical expertise.  No other  \n \n          15    state has a physician that they can consult and say what  \n \n          16    went wrong when these guys set up in Ohio, what went wrong  \n \n          17    in Texas when they sprayed the viewers' gallery with  \n \n          18    pentothal. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  Have you had any discussions with Director  \n \n          20    Crawford about the scope of your authority? \n \n          21    A    Oh, yes.  We talk -- I talk in his office and at the  \n \n          22    time of the execution.  In fact, he's the only director I  \n \n          23    have actually gone over to his office for other reasons and  \n \n          24    visited about this.  And again, he has no background in  \n \n          25    corrections and he has no background in medicine, so the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              64 \n \n \n \n           1    other corrections officers had long backgrounds in  \n \n           2    corrections so they were aware of what we were doing and  \n \n           3    why we were doing it.  Since he has no background in either  \n \n           4    field, he reiterated that he's totally dependent on me  \n \n           5    advising him what could and should and will be done, and he  \n \n           6    will back up -- if I think there's a change that needs to  \n \n           7    be made, he wants me to quickly inform him so he can make  \n \n           8    the appropriate changes. \n \n           9    Q    I see.  So it's your understanding that if you thought  \n \n          10    a change to the execution procedure needed to be made you  \n \n          11    would -- Director Crawford would defer to your opinion? \n \n          12    A    Absolutely. \n \n          13    Q    And would you have to inform him first before making a  \n \n          14    change? \n \n          15    A    If I made a change of the number of syringes or if I  \n \n          16    made a change of that magnitude, I would inform him that he  \n \n          17    is going to see different times.  And that's the only way  \n \n          18    he's going to know something -- I would warn him that --  \n \n          19    he's very used to sitting up in his office and seeing one  \n \n          20    drug, next minute another drug, next minute another drug.   \n \n          21    Two minutes later he's informed that we're finished.  And  \n \n          22    if we had to add extra syringes or change something  \n \n          23    significant to where you can't physically inject that many  \n \n          24    syringes, then he would -- I would tell him it's going to  \n \n          25    be two minutes between the first and second dose and then  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              65 \n \n \n \n           1    he would understand and know why it happened.  Or someone  \n \n           2    would ask him a question at the press conference, which he  \n \n           3    has to give, he would be informed of what that change was  \n \n           4    so he could answer intelligently. \n \n           5    Q    I see.  So let's just go through that a little bit.   \n \n           6    So what types of changes might you not inform him about? \n \n           7    A    Well, when we could not mix the drugs, he would not  \n \n           8    care that we could not mix the drugs as long as I could mix  \n \n           9    a sufficient dose.  If I would have required -- could not  \n \n          10    mix it that night and would require two syringes instead of  \n \n          11    one, I would immediately inform him. \n \n          12              But I have no way of returning from the execution  \n \n          13    chamber to the Director's office without upsetting their  \n \n          14    schedule so it would have to be a phone conversation, not a  \n \n          15    face-to-face conversation. \n \n \n          16              And I'm also aware that we have no other way to  \n \n          17    change once we're in that room and we're given the drugs  \n \n          18    that they thought were the right drugs when they arrived. \n \n          19    Q    I see.  So you have the impression that Director  \n \n          20    Crawford wouldn't care whether the drugs couldn't be mixed  \n \n          21    or something like that, as long as the number of syringes  \n \n          22    stayed the same, is that -- \n \n \n          23    A    Well, the only reason he would know the number of  \n \n          24    syringes were different is because the difference between  \n \n          25    the first and second drug would take two minutes instead of  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              66 \n \n \n \n           1    one.  \n \n           2    Q    I see.  Have you ever had any conversations with  \n \n           3    Director Crawford that sort of gave you the sense certain  \n \n           4    things you would inform him about and certain things you  \n \n           5    wouldn't? \n \n           6    A    When these actions occurred in this state and other  \n \n           7    states, we were aware that we were going to be under a fine  \n \n           8    tooth comb so we were already exploring if certain drugs  \n \n           9    were ruled unacceptable we would have to go to alternate  \n \n          10    drugs.  So I was researching and my conclusion was that  \n \n          11    it's going to cause problems if we have to switch drugs. \n \n          12    Q    And what do you mean by that, that it would cause  \n \n          13    problems? \n \n          14    A    Well, if Diprovan is going to be used, it requires a  \n \n          15    continuous IV infusion.  You can't put it in a syringe and  \n \n          16    inject it.  So the entire procedure is going to have to be  \n \n          17    changed.   \n \n          18    Q    Because you need a continuous IV? \n \n          19    A    Continuous infusion.  We are already anticipating that  \n \n          20    because what we use is called a triple lumen catheter.  I  \n \n          21    can simultaneously inject three independent drugs without  \n \n          22    danger of intermixing in the tubing because the catheter we  \n \n          23    use has three individual injection sites so I can get one  \n \n          24    in one and another drug in another. \n \n          25              So if a change should occur where we require  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              67 \n \n \n \n           1    continuous infusion of Diprovan, we can simultaneously give  \n \n           2    the other drugs through another port while the Diprovan is  \n \n           3    infusing. \n \n           4    Q    I see.  So if you use the Diprovan you would use one  \n \n           5    lumen of the catheter for the Diprovan and then use the  \n \n           6    other lumens for the -- \n \n           7    A    Yes.  The triple lumen anticipates that problem. \n \n           8    Q    I see.  So is that why you use the triple lumen  \n \n           9    catheter now? \n \n          10    A    We use the triple lumen because that is the most  \n \n          11    complete tray available.  There are single lumen catheter  \n \n          12    trays that are available, but they do not require all the  \n \n          13    instruments that's on the triple lumen catheter that are  \n \n          14    necessary to treat hematoma, pneumothorax, those type of  \n \n          15    complications.  Should they, in the remote possibility that  \n \n          16    any of those occur, there's sufficient material on that  \n \n          17    large tray to treat and correct those complications.   \n \n          18    Q    I see.  So that tray contains equipment necessary to  \n \n          19    deal with any complication from the femoral catheter?  \n \n          20    A    Yes.  It's a full instrument tray on triple lumen, and  \n \n          21    the single lumen does not have a full instrument tray. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  And that tray comes with a triple lumen  \n \n          23    catheter? \n \n          24    A    Yes.  It's all packaged as one unit. \n \n          25    Q    So just hypothetically, if you had to change an aspect  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              68 \n \n \n \n           1    of the procedure that wouldn't affect the timing of the  \n \n           2    drug, say giving a different drug but using the same amount  \n \n           3    of solution, is that something that you would inform the  \n \n           4    Director about? \n \n           5    A    If it was the same number of syringes and we could  \n \n           6    give it with sufficient speed, the Director would not be  \n \n           7    aware.  I mean if -- the reporters are watching this so  \n \n           8    closely that if there is a difference of one minute or so  \n \n           9    between injections or 10 or 15 minutes to time of death  \n \n          10    they immediately have questions about it.  So if there  \n \n          11    would be a problem in what the public perceives, then I  \n \n          12    would inform him this is why this happened, this is why  \n \n          13    this didn't happen, so he -- since he has no medical  \n \n          14    background he wants to be informed and so I do a good job  \n \n          15    of keeping him informed why something happened.  That's  \n \n          16    more what he's interested in, rather than opposed to what  \n \n          17    am I going to change on my own authority. \n \n          18    Q    I see.  Is there anything that wouldn't affect timing  \n \n          19    that you would tell him about, any kind of change? \n \n          20    A    No, because all he sees is the timing. \n \n          21    Q    I see.  So you'd inform him about something that  \n \n          22    affected the timing? \n \n          23    A    If there was a perceptible difference in the way the  \n \n          24    execution was carried out that someone in the -- one of the  \n \n          25    three visitors gallery would ask him a question about or  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              69 \n \n \n \n           1    anticipate a question, why did this happen, why did he  \n \n           2    cough, why did he wiggle, why did he move, he's prepared to  \n \n           3    answer those questions. \n \n           4    Q    I see.  So you'd inform him about anything that  \n \n           5    happened -- \n \n           6    A    Absolutely anything. \n \n           7    Q    Anything -- I'm sorry.  \n \n           8    A    Anything that could be noticed or questioned. \n \n           9    Q    So you'd inform him about anything that happened  \n \n          10    during the execution that might be noticed by the  \n \n          11    witnesses? \n \n          12    A    Yes. \n \n          13    Q    Okay.  Thank you.  Are you aware -- are there any  \n \n          14    regulations or rules that require you to notify the  \n \n          15    Director about certain aspects of the procedure or certain  \n \n          16    changes? \n \n          17    A    Absolutely not.  This is just good practice. \n \n          18    Q    I see.  And is any part of the execution procedure  \n \n          19    written down? \n \n          20    A    I have never seen it.  If it was, it would have been  \n \n          21    written on my recommendations. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  Do you have any idea why it might not be  \n \n          23    written down? \n \n          24    A    I'm sure it's written down somewhere.  If they're  \n \n          25    checking the logs of all the drugs every time we use them  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              70 \n \n \n \n           1    and recording expiration dates and number of sheets and  \n \n           2    needles that we use, I'm certain they have it written down  \n \n           3    somewhere. \n \n           4    Q    But in terms of the aspects of the procedure that  \n \n           5    you're responsible for, that you perform, those aren't  \n \n           6    written down, to your knowledge? \n \n           7    A    It might be written in there, but it would be written  \n \n           8    on by somebody observing what I was doing and using their  \n \n           9    interpretation.  So if there was a written procedure that  \n \n          10    they had done I would -- you know, I'm curious to see what  \n \n          11    they think I'm doing, but I don't know that they write down  \n \n          12    the individual details of how I insert an 18-gauge rather  \n \n          13    than a 22-gauge or a 14-gauge needle. \n \n          14    Q    I see.  So people might write things down as you're  \n \n          15    doing them, but there's no guide that you follow as you're  \n \n          16    doing it? \n \n          17    A    Absolutely not. \n \n          18    Q    So you just rely on your memory? \n \n          19    A    Yes. \n \n          20    Q    And your judgment? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    Do you have a clinical practice? \n \n          23    A    Because of a severe heart attack I have quit active  \n \n          24    practice for a few years.  Now that I am in excellent  \n \n          25    health, my Jesuit training does not allow me to sit on the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              71 \n \n \n \n           1    byside so I have recently completed a staff application and  \n \n           2    I will be back in active practice within the month.  And I  \n \n           3    have also been doing medical missionary work in South  \n \n           4    America, Central America.  I will go to Central America and  \n \n           5    do 150 operations a week.  I am old but not slow. \n \n           6    Q    Sure.  Certainly.  About when did you -- when did you  \n \n           7    stop practicing before? \n \n           8    A    As a surgeon in the operating room every day, which  \n \n           9    gave me the heart attack, was probably around 2000, 2002.   \n \n          10    I have since stayed on as medical director of a -- I have  \n \n          11    worked at the Vein Clinic in St. Louis.  I have -- \n \n          12              MR. PRITCHETT:  Objection on the grounds that  \n \n          13    we're releasing identifying information at the moment. \n \n          14              MS. ANDERS:   We would certainly consent to that  \n \n          15    type of information being -- \n \n          16    A    Yes.  I have always worked part-time in lokeins work  \n \n          17    and injection treatment or medical director of a vein  \n \n          18    center. \n \n          19              MS. ANDERS:  Okay.  I'd just like to -- maybe we  \n \n          20    can establish is it okay for the doctor to answer these  \n \n          21    questions about where he's worked and things like that  \n \n          22    because we certainly would agree that that all should be  \n \n          23    subject to a protective order. \n \n          24              THE COURT:  You say is it okay that he not be  \n \n          25    asked that, or not respond? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              72 \n \n \n \n           1              MS. ANDERS:  That he go ahead and answer that  \n \n           2    subject to Mr. Pritchett's objection.  Because otherwise,  \n \n           3    we're going to have to talk about the protective order  \n \n           4    later and I might have to go back and ask him those  \n \n           5    questions because he won't have given a substantive answer. \n \n           6              MR. PRITCHETT:  Well, I object to the identifying  \n \n           7    information coming out in general other than, as I  \n \n           8    mentioned earlier, general time frames or general  \n \n           9    locations, even subject to the protective order. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  I think he can talk about his  \n \n          11    practice in general.  You don't have to specify where it is  \n \n          12    you practice, that kind of thing.  Just an inquiry as to  \n \n          13    the background, but not where.   \n \n          14              MR. PRITCHETT:  I still ask that that identifying  \n \n          15    information be subject to the protective order. \n \n          16              THE COURT:  I just told you how my ruling is  \n \n          17    going to be on that, protective order notwithstanding. \n \n          18              MR. PRITCHETT:  Okay.  Thank you, Judge. \n \n          19              MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry.  Could you restate that? \n \n          20              THE COURT:  No, I won't restate it.  Continue  \n \n          21    your examination.  You don't have a lot of time left. \n \n          22              MS. ANDERS:  Then I guess I'd just like to note  \n \n          23    that I probably will need more time. \n \n          24              THE COURT:  No, I don't see any reason to extend  \n \n          25    the time at this time.   \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              73 \n \n \n \n           1              MS. ANDERS:  Okay. \n \n           2    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So I think you mentioned that you are  \n \n           3    still doing some practice now; is that correct? \n \n           4    A    Because I worked for a number of years I still have  \n \n           5    patients call me for advice and recommendations and  \n \n           6    referrals, so I will talk with patients on a daily basis,  \n \n           7    recommending surgery or I'll sometimes go in and assist in  \n \n           8    their surgeries.  Like I said, I'm going back to active  \n \n           9    practice and looking forward to it. \n \n          10    Q    And so do you -- you don't perform surgeries at this  \n \n          11    point, do you?  \n \n          12    A    Every year in South America. \n \n          13    Q    I'm sorry.  That's right.  What types of procedures do  \n \n          14    you do in South America? \n \n          15    A    Anything that comes through the door in a Third World  \n \n          16    country, which most people here couldn't possibly  \n \n          17    comprehend doing, much less doing a large volume.  We're  \n \n          18    able to complete hysterectomies, gallbladders, colon  \n \n          19    surgery, hernia repairs in the two or three weeks that  \n \n          20    we're down there.  But we will turn out a very large volume  \n \n          21    of surgeries simply because I'm -- I think the most I did  \n \n          22    was about 25 cases in one day down there. \n \n          23    Q    Has your medical license ever been restricted? \n \n          24    A    I have received a reprimand I think based on 1993 to  \n \n          25    '97 I had an office manager leave and take records.  The  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              74 \n \n \n \n           1    new office manager filled out my staff application the  \n \n           2    minute she arrived in the door.  It was submitted to the  \n \n           3    hospital, and because there were discrepancies because of  \n \n           4    the missing records I technically had an incorrect  \n \n           5    application.  That did not become a problem until five or  \n \n           6    six years later when the hospital didn't like the fact that  \n \n           7    I was retired on a medical disability.  They wanted me to  \n \n           8    be removed from the staff so they could recruit other  \n \n           9    surgeons.  So suddenly my dyslexia and failure to recognize  \n \n          10    that there was an error in my 25-page application became a  \n \n          11    serious problem to the hospital, and to prevent me from  \n \n          12    returning to practice they filed a databank entry as a  \n \n          13    matter of meanness. \n \n          14    Q    I see.  And you may have said this, but I think I  \n \n          15    missed it.  The 25-page application, what was that for? \n \n          16    A    The staff application that you submit every year.   \n \n          17    There was an error between the '92 and the '97 or '96  \n \n          18    applications. \n \n          19    Q    And that was your application to the hospital? \n \n          20    A    Filled out by my office people. \n \n          21    Q    I see.  And when you retired on medical disability  \n \n          22    what was the nature of that disability? \n \n          23    A    I had two heart attacks consecutively, and actually  \n \n          24    I've recovered quite well. \n \n          25    Q    Do you have any training in the induction of general  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              75 \n \n \n \n           1    anesthesia? \n \n           2    A    I don't know that that has anything to do with this  \n \n           3    because the induction of general anesthesia is not what  \n \n           4    we're doing when we're doing an execution. \n \n           5              THE COURT:  The question, Doctor, is do you have  \n \n           6    training? \n \n           7    A    I do lots of anesthesia.  Because I have three or four  \n \n           8    anesthesiologists in my family, I'm required to assist or  \n \n           9    do the induction to help them.  Yes, I have induced the  \n \n          10    anesthesia for them because it's a -- family. \n \n          11    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  So you have assisted anesthesia -- \n \n          12    A    I have induced anesthesia many times, either in the  \n \n          13    course of endoscopies, in the course of surgeries, starting  \n \n          14    an operation or induction before the anesthesiologist gets  \n \n          15    there.  I'm quite capable of doing that.  It's not a matter  \n \n          16    of training.  It's a matter of doing it. \n \n          17    Q    And have you for the purposes of surgery, say  \n \n          18    abdominal surgery, have you ever induced anesthesia  \n \n          19    yourself without the aid of any anesthesiologist? \n \n          20    A    Yes, because with a gunshot wound, a car wreck arrives  \n \n          21    in the emergency room, I'm the first one there.  I will  \n \n          22    have that patient asleep on a respirator before the rest of  \n \n          23    the surgery crew arrives.  So, yes, I have induced the  \n \n          24    anesthesia.  They simply follow up and catch up with where  \n \n          25    I am at the point.  Any surgeon can do that.  And should. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              76 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    That would be anesthesia for the purposes of surgery  \n \n           2    and there would be no further anesthesia given? \n \n           3    A    The purpose of saving a life.  The continuation of the  \n \n           4    anesthesia is done by the anesthesiologist.  I must get  \n \n           5    that person breathing which means inducing an anesthetic,  \n \n           6    get them on a respirator to keep them alive until the  \n \n           7    anesthesiologist gets there.  That requires an anesthetic  \n \n           8    induction.  And I may even transfer them to the operating  \n \n           9    room.  I do not turn on the gas, because I don't want that  \n \n          10    on until the anesthesiologist is there, but I will maintain  \n \n          11    sedation and pain medication until the anesthesiologist  \n \n          12    gets there.  Then I can proceed with the surgery.  I have  \n \n          13    done it many times as a trauma surgeon. \n \n          14    Q    And what year did you graduate from medical school? \n \n          15    A    In the '60s. \n \n          16              MR. PRITCHETT:  Object on the ground of  \n \n          17    identifying the year would be identifying -- \n \n          18              THE COURT:  He said in the '60s, Mr. Pritchett.  \n \n          19              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you. \n \n          20    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  I just ask for the record where did  \n \n          21    you go to medical school? \n \n          22    A    Midwest. \n \n          23    Q    As part of your medical training or otherwise, have  \n \n          24    you gone through different scenarios that can occur or  \n \n          25    problems that can arise when inducing general anesthesia? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              77 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes.  We are recertified and retrained in ATLS which  \n \n           2    requires -- ATLS training, which is trauma life support,  \n \n           3    requires updating training on central lines, peripheral  \n \n           4    lines, intubation, induction, as a part of ambulance  \n \n           5    drivers, emergency room nurses, ER doctors and trauma  \n \n           6    surgeons. \n \n           7    Q    So just hypothetically, if you were attempting to  \n \n           8    insert a femoral catheter on anyone and they moved and you  \n \n \n           9    ended up lacerating the femoral artery, what would you do  \n \n          10    about that? \n \n          11    A    It would never happen. \n \n          12    Q    Well, hypothetically speaking, if it did happen? \n \n          13    A    Since I'm only using a 22-gauge needle for the initial  \n \n          14    insertion, this is like a small wire with a tiny hole, any  \n \n          15    laceration of anything could be controlled with 30 seconds  \n \n          16    of pressure and then proceed to try again. \n \n          17    Q    I see.  So what if you lacerated the femoral artery  \n \n          18    and a hematoma developed? \n \n          19    A    You cannot lacerate it with a 22-gauge needle.  It's  \n \n          20    two small.  It's like a stick pin.  It's no bigger than a  \n \n          21    safety pin needle and that can't lacerate. \n \n          22    Q    Well, just assuming hypothetically using a larger  \n \n          23    needle or whatever -- \n \n          24    A    Cellular does not use a larger needle.  It only uses a  \n \n          25    small needle to start the procedure.  That's why we use  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              78 \n \n \n \n           1    that needle. \n \n           2    Q    And just assuming for a second that a hematoma  \n \n           3    developed, what would you do about that? \n \n           4    A    Reach over on the tray, take the knife that's provided  \n \n           5    with the tray, open it and vent it and it would be  \n \n           6    controlled.  Actually under this setting, the hematoma  \n \n           7    would actually stop bleeding better than actually -- the  \n \n           8    medical treatment would be to drain it, but in this setting  \n \n           9    the hematoma is actually useful and it will stop the  \n \n          10    bleeding in a matter of seconds by itself. \n \n          11              So there's a medical reason why you drain a  \n \n          12    hematoma, but the reason in this situation was the hematoma  \n \n          13    would actually stop the bleeding.  But we have never and  \n \n          14    could not possibly see a hematoma in this setting because  \n \n          15    of the small needles used. \n \n          16    Q    So when you say that the hematoma would stop the  \n \n          17    bleeding, I don't really follow that.  \n \n          18    A    As it bleeds into the space it increases the pressure  \n \n          19    around the vessel.  The pressure of the hematoma is going  \n \n          20    to stop the bleeding no matter where the bleeding is. \n \n          21    Q    So the bleeding would stop on its own? \n \n          22    A    It would stop on its own. \n \n          23    Q    If that happened while you were trying to get the  \n \n          24    catheter in for an execution, how would you then get the  \n \n          25    catheter in? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              79 \n \n \n \n           1    A    He's got two legs. \n \n           2    Q    So you'd go to the other leg? \n \n           3    A    Yes.  And two vessels in the neck that I can use as  \n \n           4    back-up.  I have never failed.  The only instance that  \n \n           5    failed was an IV drug user who had been injecting his  \n \n           6    legs.  I made two attempts on the leg and saw that we were  \n \n           7    dealing with a completely clotted vessel so I immediately  \n \n           8    went to the neck.  I only have about a five-minute window  \n \n           9    from the time the inmate arrives where I have to make a  \n \n          10    judgment decision to get a sufficient IV in.  So if I can't  \n \n          11    get it in the femoral in 30 seconds, I will then turn my  \n \n          12    attention to either the subclavian or internal jugular and  \n \n          13    quickly insert it in another appropriate vessel. \n \n          14    Q    So you have about five minutes to complete the  \n \n          15    procedure? \n \n          16    A    Five to ten minutes.  That's all I need. \n \n          17    Q    I see.  And you have always completed it within that  \n \n          18    time? \n \n          19    A    It takes two minutes. \n \n          20    Q    Okay.  And has femoral access always been the first  \n \n          21    choice method of obtaining venous access for an execution? \n \n          22    A    It's my preferred method because it avoids all the  \n \n          23    complication with the subclavian.  In the rare event that  \n \n          24    someone would perforate through the vessel in a subclavian  \n \n          25    you would actually hit the lung with that small initial  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              80 \n \n \n \n           1    needle.  That could cause a pneumothorax after about four  \n \n           2    or five hours.  Plus inmates can and will manipulate their  \n \n           3    shoulders which could affect IV infusion.  Or could  \n \n           4    possibly grab or turn their head, dislodge the catheter.   \n \n           5    In a femoral vessel, it was chosen simply because it's the  \n \n           6    safest way to put it in.  It cannot be dislodged.  It  \n \n           7    cannot be manipulated by the inmate. \n \n           8    Q    So they can't move their legs or anything like that? \n \n           9    A    Absolutely not.  They are completely restrained with  \n \n          10    over-the-knee, pelvis, shoulder straps, and full arm and  \n \n          11    ankle restraints.  They could move their head because we  \n \n          12    allow them to look at their family, and they could turn  \n \n          13    their head and literally bite the bandage off of their arm,  \n \n          14    which I'm sure one might try to do some day, but with it in  \n \n          15    the leg that isn't going to happen. \n \n          16    Q    So do you know if femoral access has always been used  \n \n          17    by the DOC since they started lethal injection? \n \n          18    A    Since I was involved with the lethal injection and  \n \n          19    because of the serious problems they had on that prolonged  \n \n          20    execution, I have recommended and stuck by the femoral line  \n \n          21    which is foolproof. \n \n          22    Q    So after -- so you came in after that problematic  \n \n          23    execution? \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    And you recommended femoral access? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              81 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Yes.  They wanted me to do a cut-down because they  \n \n           2    thought that was the way to solve the problem.  I informed  \n \n           3    them that I probably could not find a cut-down tray in the  \n \n           4    prison system anywhere or in the state of Missouri.  It was  \n \n           5    ancient. \n \n           6    Q    I see.  So you mentioned the cut-down.  If you tried  \n \n           7    within your five or ten minute window to -- \n \n           8    A    It takes 30 minutes to do a cut-down. \n \n           9    Q    Is it something that you might do if you had trouble? \n \n          10    A    I haven't had to do one in 30 years. \n \n          11    Q    Would you consider doing one? \n \n          12    A    If I lived another 30 years I might. \n \n          13    Q    If you had trouble with both subclavian access and  \n \n          14    jugular access and femoral access, would you -- \n \n          15    A    That can't happen. \n \n          16    Q    Why not? \n \n          17    A    Just -- God made it that way.  You cannot clot all of  \n \n          18    those vessels off and survive. \n \n          19    Q    So I think you said that the institution of femoral  \n \n          20    access, was that based on your recommendation? \n \n          21    A    Yes. \n \n          22    Q    And was that something that had to be approved by  \n \n          23    someone, or did you just decide to do it? \n \n          24    A    No.  They wanted a foolproof solution to their problem  \n \n          25    and they did not want to have to explain to the public why  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              82 \n \n \n \n           1    things did not go well, and I said this will solve your  \n \n           2    problem forever.  And they were quite pleased that I did  \n \n           3    exactly what I said I would do, and it did exactly what it  \n \n           4    was supposed to do. \n \n           5    Q    So when you suggested femoral access, do you know who  \n \n           6    made the ultimate decision on that to approve it? \n \n           7    A    I told them that's what was necessary as opposed to a  \n \n           8    cut-down and this could be done quickly, safely, easily,  \n \n           9    and they were in complete agreement, in fact relieved, that  \n \n          10    they did not have to do a surgical procedure. \n \n          11              In the event that the central line is -- femoral  \n \n          12    line is inserted and the execution could be cancelled,   \n \n          13    which is almost impossible, I can simply go in and remove  \n \n          14    that femoral line and hold pressure for 30 seconds and  \n \n          15    there's no damage done.  With a cut-down it requires  \n \n          16    sutures and suturing a catheter.  Removing the cut-down is  \n \n          17    a surgical procedure also. \n \n          18    Q    I see.  So you would rather not do a cut-down? \n \n          19    A    It's totally unnecessary. \n \n          20    Q    So was it the Director of the DOC who approved the  \n \n          21    femoral access? \n \n          22    A    I don't even remember who the director was at that  \n \n          23    time.  I only communicate directly with John Doe 4 or 5 and  \n \n          24    he passed the information on to the Director. \n \n          25    Q    And then for the first execution that you participated  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              83 \n \n \n \n           1    in, you used the femoral catheter? \n \n           2    A    A femoral catheter, yes. \n \n           3    Q    Did someone communicate to you that that would be  \n \n           4    acceptable?  Did someone tell you that's what you would be  \n \n           5    allowed to do? \n \n           6    A    That's what I told them I was going to do because they  \n \n           7    had to order the special equipment to do it. \n \n           8    Q    I see.  So you told them that's what you were going to  \n \n           9    do and -- \n \n          10    A    Yes. \n \n          11    Q    And they ordered the -- \n \n          12    A    They ordered it. \n \n          13    Q    And in making your recommendation, did you consider  \n \n          14    the risks and benefits of a femoral catheterization? \n \n          15    A    Yes. \n \n          16    Q    And what risks and benefits did you consider? \n \n          17    A    No risk.  All benefit. \n \n          18    Q    And what are the benefits? \n \n          19    A    All benefits.  There's no way it can fail.  And no  \n \n          20    risk to the inmate. \n \n          21    Q    So there's no risk of complication? \n \n          22    A    Really, no.  It's not put in until all appeals are  \n \n          23    satisfied.  There's no chance there's a secondary appeal  \n \n          24    going to come.  We have never, and don't even anticipate  \n \n          25    the situation would occur that once it's inserted that an  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              84 \n \n \n \n           1    appeal will somehow magically appear.  So we don't really  \n \n           2    start -- and that's the advantage we have.  It can be done  \n \n           3    quickly, but it can also be removed quickly.  And that's  \n \n           4    what I communicated to the Director, that it was much  \n \n           5    easier than doing another surgical procedure to remove a  \n \n           6    surgical cut-down, and would allow rapid infusion of the  \n \n           7    drugs by nonmedical people. \n \n           8    Q    I see.  So the primary benefit of femoral is that it  \n \n           9    allows rapid infusion? \n \n          10    A    Predictable infusion. \n \n          11    Q    I see.  And is your primary priority in performing  \n \n          12    executions the timing issue? \n \n          13    A    It's as much as the weight, mental attitude, and in  \n \n          14    the rare instance, sex, total body fat, age.  Those are all  \n \n          15    factors that affect the reaction to the drug, the doses  \n \n          16    used.  These are all things that, while they have little  \n \n          17    impact, you can't ignore them. \n \n          18    Q    All right. \n \n          19    A    States where no doctors are involved, they ignore all  \n \n          20    of those variables and simply inject a standard amount by a  \n \n          21    janitor I guess is what one fellow is. \n \n          22    Q    Right.  And you mentioned several times that it's  \n \n          23    important that the injection procedure be quick. \n \n          24    A    Yes.  All drugs are time-related.  I could give each  \n \n          25    of those drugs over a prolonged period of time on anyone in  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              85 \n \n \n \n           1    this room with absolutely no effect if you give it slow  \n \n           2    enough or through a route where it's metabolized.  Each of  \n \n           3    those drugs is metabolized theoretically almost as fast as  \n \n           4    you give it if you gave it slow enough.  None of these are  \n \n           5    lethal drugs.  They are simply a dose of a drug that if not  \n \n           6    reversed has consequences.  But the drug itself is the same  \n \n           7    drugs that are on the shelf in any pharmacy.  At the time  \n \n           8    they were used, any pharmacy and any hospital had all of  \n \n           9    these drugs available and that's why they were chosen.   \n \n          10    Every doctor was comfortable with their use.  They were  \n \n          11    quite aware what the drug was and what to expect. \n \n          12    Q    So let me just go back to the risks and benefits of  \n \n          13    femoral catheterization.  You said the benefits are that  \n \n          14    it's not very risky, is that correct? \n \n          15    A    It's virtually risk-free.  It's not used in clinical  \n \n          16    practice because the anesthesiologist would prefer to have  \n \n          17    the IV up in the neck, head and neck area where they have  \n \n          18    control of it.  They can change it.  They can enlarge it by  \n \n          19    special techniques.  They can double the size of it if they  \n \n          20    want to.  And if it's -- in my primary concern, if I would  \n \n          21    ever use it, would be in the trauma situation where I'm  \n \n          22    operating for abdominal injuries.  If I have an abdominal  \n \n          23    injury, I do not want the catheter on the other side of my  \n \n          24    injury because I may be dumping my blood and fluid into the  \n \n          25    abdomen rather than into the patient.  So it makes no sense  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              86 \n \n \n \n           1    to use it in clinical practice.  There's very good reasons  \n \n           2    why I don't use it anymore in practice.  Only in an  \n \n           3    emergency.  And then I would simply switch to a neck method  \n \n           4    for the benefit of the anesthesiologist. \n \n           5    Q    I see.  So you said there are reasons that you don't  \n \n           6    use the femoral catheterization in your practice?  \n \n           7    A    That's correct.  Because mostly I would be doing it  \n \n           8    only in a trauma situation where the patient was legally  \n \n           9    dead at that time and I would use two femorals and two neck  \n \n          10    veins to dump five points of blood in in five minutes and  \n \n          11    try to revive that patient sufficient to take them to the  \n \n          12    operating room to stop the bleeding that is inside the  \n \n          13    abdomen and the anesthesiologist wouldn't start until we  \n \n          14    had neck veins going to where they could control the amount  \n \n          15    of blood they gave.  Because the femoral has a chance that  \n \n          16    it's not going in the patient.  It's actually going through  \n \n          17    the ruptured liver or the ruptured spleen. \n \n          18    Q    I see.  And is that a problem generally? \n \n          19    A    It doesn't help the patient. \n \n          20    Q    Is that a problem in an execution situation? \n \n          21    A    No, because they have not been in a car wreck or shot  \n \n          22    or stabbed. \n \n          23    Q    And if a complication occurred using femoral access  \n \n          24    for an execution, would you consider changing back to  \n \n          25    peripheral access? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              87 \n \n \n \n           1    A    No. \n \n           2    Q    Why not? \n \n           3    A    It isn't reliable or predictable or safe. \n \n           4    Q    So by predictable, what do you mean? \n \n           5    A    We know that we're going to have -- the inmate is  \n \n           6    unconscious in 15 seconds.  He's paralyzed a minute and a  \n \n           7    half after that.  His heart will stop beating three to four  \n \n           8    minutes after the injection starts.  You cannot guarantee  \n \n           9    that with a peripheral IV. \n \n          10    Q    So by predictable, you know exactly how long it should  \n \n          11    take? \n \n          12    A    Yes.  And you don't know that if you can't give the  \n \n          13    drug rapidly. \n \n          14    Q    And by reliable, what do you mean? \n \n          15    A    We know it's going in there and it can't leak around  \n \n          16    the needle.  When you use a peripheral IV, you're using a  \n \n          17    two-inch needle.  You're not using a central line.  So if  \n \n          18    you force it, it will leak and leak into the hand.  In the  \n \n          19    case of the individual where the vein in the thumb was  \n \n          20    used, I'm sure most of the medication went into his hand \n \n          21    rather than into his veins.  With a central line that  \n \n          22    doesn't happen. \n \n          23    Q    I see.  And when you said that the femoral procedure  \n \n          24    is safe, what did you mean? \n \n          25    A    No complications.  I can't puncture a lung.  Can't hit  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              88 \n \n \n \n           1    the wrong thing.  The vein is protected by muscle on one  \n \n           2    side and the artery, which I can feel with my finger.  So  \n \n           3    if I could feel the artery with my finger and my finger is  \n \n           4    on top of the artery, I'm not going to stick my finger.   \n \n           5    And the nerve is on the other side of all of this, so nerve  \n \n           6    and artery lacerations are impossible. \n \n           7    Q    I see.   \n \n           8              MS. ANDERS:  And, Your Honor, I'd just like to  \n \n           9    ask how much time I have left at this point. \n \n          10              THE COURT:  We started at 1 o'clock and we'll  \n \n          11    finish at 2 o'clock. \n \n          12              MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry.  Finishing at 3 o'clock? \n \n          13              THE COURT:  Started at 1 o'clock and finishing at  \n \n          14    3 o'clock.  You're correct.  I'm sorry. \n \n          15              MS. ANDERS:  I'd just like you to know that I'd  \n \n          16    like more time than that. \n \n          17              THE COURT:  I think you've asked for more time  \n \n          18    and I told you already and I see no reason to change that  \n \n          19    at this time, and I won't change it. \n \n          20              MS. ANDERS:  I understand, Your Honor. \n \n          21    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Would you be aware of it if a  \n \n          22    complication of femoral access occurred during an  \n \n          23    execution? \n \n          24    A    It couldn't occur once I put that line in using this  \n \n          25    method.  We do these a hundred times a day in every  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              89 \n \n \n \n           1    hospital across the nation and we walk out of that room  \n \n           2    with the confidence that that is not going to fail once  \n \n           3    that's in.  That's why we use this method in every hospital  \n \n           4    every day.  It can't fail.  The patient's life depends on  \n \n           5    this thing functioning perfectly once it's inserted. \n \n           6    Q    So are there any complications that could make  \n \n           7    themselves -- that could become visible after you have left  \n \n           8    the execution chamber? \n \n           9    A    No.  Complications can occur months and weeks later  \n \n          10    due to long-standing problem, but the complications that  \n \n          11    you are referring to that occur with the insertion, these  \n \n          12    only occur on a person that is doing his first five  \n \n          13    insertions.  After someone has done ten of anything, he  \n \n          14    will never have another complication for the rest of his  \n \n          15    life. \n \n          16    Q    I see.  And do you examine an inmate after death? \n \n          17    A    I disconnect the line and clamp it because it's a  \n \n          18    Heparinized system.  If it was not clamped the medical  \n \n          19    examiner could not stop this thing from leaking.  But we  \n \n          20    are required to leave the catheter in place and simply  \n \n          21    disconnect the hose and the cardiac monitors. \n \n          22    Q    So do you examine the catheter site after -- \n \n          23    A    I can see it because I have to remove the sheet to  \n \n          24    remove the IV tubing. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  I'm just going to introduce an exhibit. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              90 \n \n \n \n           1              You have just been given a photo which was part  \n \n           2    of the documents that the State produced to us from the  \n \n           3    Johnston execution.  \n \n           4    A    Yes. \n \n           5    Q    I think that was 6/30/05. \n \n           6    A    Yes, I think so. \n \n           7    Q    Did you perform the femoral catheterization? \n \n           8    A    Yes. \n \n           9    Q    And do you see a hematoma in that picture? \n \n          10    A    No. \n \n          11    Q    Could you explain why you say that? \n \n          12    A    I don't see one. \n \n          13    Q    If I told you that three other physicians have looked  \n \n          14    at these photos and thought they saw a hematoma there,  \n \n          15    would that cause you to reconsider? \n \n          16    A    No.  They are just making your case.  There's no  \n \n          17    hematoma there. \n \n          18    Q    So you have never had a person move or anything like  \n \n          19    this while you're putting -- \n \n          20    A    No.  They're sedated.  They are very comfortable,  \n \n          21    calm, relaxed.  If they're agitated, upset, I will ask them  \n \n          22    and if they want a sedative I will provide that for them,  \n \n          23    so they are very calm.  They don't feel this.  They are  \n \n          24    very comfortable. \n \n          25    Q    I see.  And have you had any training in the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              91 \n \n \n \n           1    pharmacology of thiopental? \n \n           2    A    No. \n \n           3    Q    What is the pH of thiopental? \n \n           4    A    I have no idea. \n \n           5    Q    Is it -- do you know whether it's acidic or basic? \n \n           6    A    I know it's caustic.  If that's basic, but I know it  \n \n           7    will necrose if you infiltrate it. \n \n           8    Q    Can you explain to me how thiopental distributes  \n \n           9    through the body? \n \n          10    A    By the bloodstream.  It's given in the blood and it's  \n \n          11    distributed immediately to all parts of the body. \n \n          12    Q    So is there some progression?  Does it go somewhere  \n \n          13    first or -- \n \n          14    A    No, it goes everywhere immediately.  That's why we use  \n \n          15    the central line.  All the drugs we use are distributed to  \n \n          16    all parts of the body within five seconds.  When you use a  \n \n          17    peripheral IV it can be five to 15 seconds after you give  \n \n          18    it before there is any effect.  With a central line the  \n \n          19    effect is immediate in every part of the body, so a drop of  \n \n          20    blood that's in the heart is in your toe in two heart  \n \n          21    beats. \n \n          22    Q    I see.  So the same thing is true with thiopental? \n \n          23    A    Yes. \n \n          24    Q    And what dose of thiopental would you consider too low  \n \n          25    for execution purposes? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              92 \n \n \n \n           1    A    500 milligrams reliably, but if someone said the court  \n \n           2    has said now you have to use 500 milligrams, I would say  \n \n           3    one out of 20 may not be fully asleep when the other dose  \n \n           4    is given and I would caution them that some observer might  \n \n           5    say I don't agree, like seeing this hematoma which isn't  \n \n           6    here, somebody would say, well, if you're only using 500  \n \n           7    I saw his eyes blink, therefore he was not unconscious.  So  \n \n           8    if we're saying we're giving two grams, there isn't a  \n \n           9    physician anywhere that would say that's an improper dose. \n \n          10    Q    I see.  And have you -- I think you mentioned talking  \n \n          11    with people from other states about the execution  \n \n          12    procedure. \n \n          13    A    Yes. \n \n          14    Q    Have you consulted with any other jurisdictions  \n \n          15    recently? \n \n          16    A    Yes, California. \n \n          17    Q    And for what purpose? \n \n          18    A    They had a big brew-ha about a canceled execution, so  \n \n          19    I was talking with the warden at that time. \n \n          20    Q    I see.  And what was the substance of that  \n \n          21    conversation? \n \n          22    A    We don't want this to happen again, so he was asking  \n \n          23    my advice. \n \n          24    Q    Were you asking any advice from him? \n \n          25    A    No. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              93 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    And what -- \n \n           2    A    He didn't know anybody else to talk to that was fluent  \n \n           3    in executions. \n \n           4    Q    And what advice did you give him? \n \n           5    A    I -- I volunteered my service to be available if he  \n \n           6    needed additional help on-site.  If he preferred, I would  \n \n           7    recommend what he do differently.   \n \n           8    Q    And have you consulted with any other doctors or  \n \n           9    anything like that? \n \n          10    A    No.  None -- there's no other doctor knows anything  \n \n          11    about this.  If I would ask another anesthesiologist, which  \n \n          12    I have, they are more interested in what the effects are  \n \n          13    because they have never done anything like this and they  \n \n          14    don't know what -- they really don't know what the effects  \n \n          15    are. \n \n          16    Q    I see.  Have you talked with other states besides  \n \n          17    California? \n \n          18    A    Yes. \n \n          19    Q    And what states? \n \n          20    A    Lots. \n \n          21              THE COURT:  Ms. Anders, I'm going to give you  \n \n          22    five minutes to wrap this up. \n \n          23              MS. ANDERS:  Okay.  Thank you, Your Honor. \n \n          24    Q    (By Ms. Anders)  Could you give me some examples of  \n \n          25    other states you have talked to? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              94 \n \n \n \n           1    A    Connecticut, Maine, Court of Military Justice in  \n \n           2    Leavenworth, Federal Penitentiary in Terre Haute, and  \n \n           3    Florida and Texas. \n \n           4    Q    And was that for the purpose of your giving them  \n \n           5    advice? \n \n           6    A    50/50.  One time I was comparing notes and advising  \n \n           7    them, but most of the time they were -- the Federal  \n \n           8    Penitentiary in Leavenworth basically was asking we don't  \n \n           9    know anything about this, please tell us what we need to  \n \n          10    obtain, what we have to do, and I had to start them out  \n \n          11    from ground zero. \n \n          12    Q    I see.  And the times when there's been an exchange of  \n \n          13    views, what have the substance of those conversations been? \n \n          14    A    The assistant warden also provides them with our  \n \n          15    written protocols of who goes where, when, what time you   \n \n          16    bring in witnesses, and I had the drugs and the dosages and  \n \n          17    my recommendation and we forwarded that to them or discuss  \n \n          18    it with them over the telephone once they receive the  \n \n          19    printed material. \n \n          20    Q    I see.  And just going back to injection speed for a  \n \n          21    second, and I know I only have a couple minutes, was it  \n \n          22    your recommendation to inject the drugs as quickly as  \n \n          23    possible? \n \n          24    A    Yes. \n \n          25    Q    And why is that? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              95 \n \n \n \n           1    A    There's no advantage to slow injection. \n \n           2    Q    And why did you think that a fast injection would be  \n \n           3    good? \n \n           4    A    They don't do any good in the solution.  You want a  \n \n           5    rapid onset of the drug, and these drugs are rapid onset  \n \n           6    drugs.  If you give them slowly they just don't work.  And  \n \n           7    you want -- the timing is more critical than most  \n \n           8    nonmedical people realize.  The timing is really essential,  \n \n           9    and if you wait too long after the pentothal, the heart and  \n \n          10    blood pressure may eventually drop so the pancuronium  \n \n          11    doesn't circulate.  And you really require a strong heart  \n \n          12    beat to circulate the pancuronium to the entire body.  And  \n \n          13    it's for the same reason that the potassium needs to be  \n \n          14    circulated.  It doesn't need to be sitting in a nonflowing  \n \n          15    vessel.  And the only way you can guarantee that is by  \n \n          16    rapid injection. \n \n          17    Q    Did you also have the understanding that the DOC  \n \n          18    wanted rapid executions? \n \n          19    A    They don't want to wait 25 minutes with witnesses  \n \n          20    standing around wondering what happened. \n \n          21    Q    So 25 minutes would be too long? \n \n          22    A    Five minutes is too long.  There's no reason why it  \n \n          23    should take more than five minutes to perform three drug  \n \n          24    injections and that they should have the effect on the  \n \n          25    inmate.  There's no point in prolonging this.  That's cruel  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              96 \n \n \n \n           1    and unusual. \n \n           2    Q    And there's no medical reason to give the drugs any  \n \n           3    slower? \n \n           4    A    No.  Only the initial dose of pentothal, which could  \n \n           5    cause excitement or seizures, and once that plateau has  \n \n           6    been reached, it's safe to give all three drugs as rapidly  \n \n           7    as possible. \n \n           8              MS. ANDERS:  Your Honor, that would conclude a  \n \n           9    line of questioning, but I would note that I have other  \n \n          10    lines of questioning that I would raise if allowed to do  \n \n          11    so. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Any follow-up, Mr. Pritchett? \n \n          13              MR. PRITCHETT:  A little bit, Your Honor.   \n \n          14    CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PRITCHETT:  \n \n          15    Q    Doctor, you discussed your understanding as to your  \n \n          16    authority to conduct your involvement in executions up  \n \n          17    until the present time.  What is your current understanding  \n \n          18    of who has the authority to determine whether changes may  \n \n          19    be made in the method of execution? \n \n          20    A    Yes, the Director has the ultimate authority on all of  \n \n          21    these executions and after going through this process he's  \n \n          22    going to be better informed what's going on.  He may not  \n \n          23    understand, so it's also my job to explain to him why these  \n \n          24    changes are required or necessary or help keep him informed  \n \n          25    of what we're doing and what's going on and why. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              97 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    If you're informed that the plan is for executions in  \n \n           2    the future to have five grams of the sodium pentothal or  \n \n           3    the thiopental, would you deviate from that five grams  \n \n           4    without informing the Director? \n \n           5    A    If we could -- I'd really be surprised if we would be  \n \n           6    able to get it, but if it was -- after we discussed this  \n \n           7    and said I want five grams given and we could not obtain it  \n \n           8    or give it, yes, he would be informed or I would inform him  \n \n           9    that I can give that safely but I have to use two syringes,  \n \n          10    is that acceptable.  And we would discuss that.   \n \n          11    Q    And what is your understanding as to who would be able  \n \n          12    to make the final call on that decision? \n \n          13    A    The Director would, but I would have to explain the  \n \n          14    timing and what it would appear or how it would affect the  \n \n          15    other drugs, and he's very receptive to my education. \n \n          16    Q    So it would be the Doctor's call based on your advice? \n \n          17    A    Yes.  The Director's call. \n \n          18    Q    If you were to change any of the drugs at this point,  \n \n          19    would that be something that you now would expect to inform  \n \n \n          20    the Director of? \n \n          21    A    If I had changed any drugs at any time, if I changed  \n \n          22    the drug, absolutely I would have informed the Director. \n \n          23    Q    Let me back up.  If you had changed the dosages -- if  \n \n          24    you change the dose of any drug in the future, is that  \n \n          25    something you understand the Director wants to know? \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              98 \n \n \n \n           1    A    He wants to know that now.  And in the past my  \n \n           2    understanding was as long as the -- it was still sufficient  \n \n           3    doses, I thought he did not need to be informed, but now he  \n \n           4    will be informed of changes as they occur. \n \n           5    Q    And if there is ever a need to go from a femoral  \n \n           6    vein access to some other sort of access, is it your  \n \n           7    understanding that that's something the Director wants to  \n \n \n           8    be informed of? \n \n           9    A    I will so inform him, but I am -- I'm gowned, gloved,  \n \n          10    prepared to do it, so I will simply switch from one to the  \n \n          11    other and then I will inform him after I have done it  \n \n          12    probably, simply because of how we are dealing with this,  \n \n          13    unless he tells me I want to know before you switch, then I  \n \n          14    will of course do that.  But it's my recommendation that I  \n \n          15    will notify him if I have to make a change. \n \n          16    Q    So if the Director indicates he would like to know  \n \n          17    and make the final decision if you have to change from a  \n \n          18    femoral access to some other access, is that what you would  \n \n          19    do? \n \n          20    A    He's the boss.   \n \n          21    Q    You indicated on one execution you had to go from a  \n \n          22    femoral vein access because of intravenous drug use through  \n \n          23    the leg to neck access, and you also discussed subclavian  \n \n          24    access. \n \n          25    A    Yes. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                              99 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    Are those common means of obtaining access for drugs  \n \n           2    in a surgical setting? \n \n           3    A    Yes, it's preferred by the anesthesiologist, and they  \n \n           4    use the neck and subclavian interchangeably because the  \n \n           5    insertion point is only an inch apart and they wind up in  \n \n           6    exactly the same location, so neck access and subclavian  \n \n           7    access means internal jugular access. \n \n           8    Q    So subclavian or neck is more standard in surgical  \n \n           9    procedural -- \n \n          10    A    Absolutely, for the reasons I stated, not only with  \n \n          11    trauma, but then the anesthesiologist has complete  \n \n          12    control.  The anesthesiologist can take this catheter out  \n \n          13    and by inserting a cellular wire back in, she can exchange  \n \n          14    that for one, two, or three other catheters in a crisis  \n \n          15    situation, but she couldn't do that if it was under the  \n \n          16    drapes in the leg.  So the anesthesiologist has the  \n \n          17    capability of quickly switching to a larger or additional  \n \n          18    catheters using this in the neck, or the triple lumen can  \n \n          19    use the extra lumens.  But they just won't start a case  \n \n          20    unless they have a neck access that they can actually put  \n \n          21    their hands on so they can see if it's not functioning  \n \n          22    properly. \n \n          23    Q    If it were necessary for you to recommend access other  \n \n          24    than femoral access through the neck or through the  \n \n          25    subclavian entry -- and by subclavian, is that near the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             100 \n \n \n \n           1    clavicle? \n \n           2    A    Subclavian is under the clavicle, yes. \n \n           3    Q    If it became necessary for you to make a  \n \n           4    recommendation that we go from femoral -- the execution  \n \n           5    site go from femoral access to one of those other two  \n \n           6    access, are those types of venous access that you have  \n \n           7    experience in performing? \n \n           8    A    Yes, but it requires significant modification of the  \n \n           9    facility.  In other words, the bed must have the capability  \n \n          10    of being tilted with the feet up so these veins would  \n \n          11    dilate sufficiently to guarantee safety.  Plus it would be  \n \n          12    prudent to have chest tube capability available.  I have  \n \n          13    rudimentary chest tube capability on this tray as I have  \n \n          14    selected.  But if you said I would always do subclavian, I  \n \n          15    would have chest tube available on every occasion. \n \n          16    Q    So if in a rare instance you needed to go subclavian  \n \n          17    or neck for access, would you be able to do that, as you  \n \n          18    understand, in the current set-up of the prison where  \n \n          19    executions occur? \n \n          20    A    This tray is set up to be used interchangeably in  \n \n          21    either place, and that's why we selected this particular  \n \n          22    tray.  It's actually designed as a subclavian catheter  \n \n          23    which can be used as a femoral catheter, but it's just  \n \n          24    called a central line triple lumen. \n \n          25    Q    What's the standard dose in a surgical setting for  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             101 \n \n \n \n           1    sodium pentothal? \n \n           2    A    Usually those ampules are 500 milligrams or less.   \n \n           3    When an anesthetic is being induced, the anesthesiologist,  \n \n           4    if they were using pentothal, would give a dose to the  \n \n           5    point where they would see the facial reaction indicating  \n \n           6    the pentothal had taken effect.  They immediately stop  \n \n           7    giving, whether they have given 100, 200, 300 milligrams,  \n \n           8    immediately stop giving the pentothal and then immediately  \n \n           9    paralyze and intubate the patient and start the anesthetic,  \n \n          10    which is the gas, going through the inhalation tubing in  \n \n          11    the tracheal tube.  So the actual anesthetic agent goes  \n \n          12    through the tracheal tube and they must reach a sufficient  \n \n          13    level of gas.  So if you start the operation five or ten  \n \n          14    minutes after the gas is started, the individual will move  \n \n          15    because they do not have sufficient anesthesia for the  \n \n          16    procedure.  So it takes about ten to 15 minutes for a gas  \n \n          17    to render them safely unconscious, stay unconscious, and  \n \n          18    also relieve all pain. \n \n          19    Q    Of course we don't use gas in the execution process.   \n \n          20    You have indicated that 2 or 2.5 grams in your judgment is  \n \n          21    enough to permit the administration of the remaining drugs  \n \n          22    in a painless manner.  I was kind of confused in the  \n \n          23    testimony myself.  I'd just like to ask the question  \n \n          24    directly.  If 2 to 2.5 grams are what's given, is that  \n \n          25    sufficient in your judgment, to a reasonable degree of  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             102 \n \n \n \n           1    medical certainty, to keep the inmate unconscious and  \n \n           2    unable to feel pain for the time period it would take for  \n \n           3    the execution to be completed? \n \n           4    A    The two-gram dose would ensure that he would stay  \n \n           5    unconscious for at least 15 minutes in 99 percent of the  \n \n           6    population.  The only qualifier would be body fat, a  \n \n           7    certain percentage of body fat would absorb the drug and  \n \n           8    not allow it to circulate.  It's actually effective only in  \n \n           9    the brain, but you have to have it everywhere in the body  \n \n          10    to keep that level in the brain available. \n \n          11    Q    And an execution does not take 15 minutes.  \n \n          12    A    No.  We're done in three to five minutes. \n \n          13    Q    On the photograph you were shown, I think it's  \n \n          14    identified as Exhibit No. 5 -- \n \n          15    A    Yes. \n \n          16    Q    -- you said you didn't see a hematoma. \n \n          17    A    What they're seeing is where I -- \n \n          18              THE COURT:  Doctor, there isn't a question in  \n \n          19    front of you yet.  Let's get the question. \n \n          20    Q    (By Mr. Pritchett)  What would you see or what would  \n \n          21    you expect to see if there was a hematoma?  How can you say  \n \n          22    there's not one here? \n \n          23    A    What they're seeing is the site where I injected my  \n \n          24    local anesthesia.  It causes a little blue mark.  A  \n \n          25    hematoma would be the size of a tennis ball. \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             103 \n \n \n \n           1    Q    So you don't see any -- and would that have a  \n \n           2    distinctive color to it, the tennis ball? \n \n           3    A    It would not necessarily have a color.  It takes hours  \n \n           4    for the color to develop, and since we're doing a deep  \n \n           5    injection inside other tissue you would see the tennis ball  \n \n           6    and the color would not occur until the next day, but the  \n \n           7    tennis ball would be obvious.  And it would only occur if  \n \n           8    the artery was punctured.  You cannot get a hematoma from a  \n \n           9    vein.  All you see is where I injected the local. \n \n          10    Q    What if any significance is there to the blue line  \n \n          11    that you mentioned? \n \n          12    A    That's where the local anesthesia was injected with a  \n \n          13    25-gauge needle and that -- in some instances, I not only  \n \n          14    feel for the femoral artery but I will also mark it with a  \n \n          15    magic marker.  I do not see the marker on this inmate.  I  \n \n          16    probably used my finger because he was probably thin.  But  \n \n          17    if it's a moderately obese individual I will use a magic  \n \n          18    marker to exactly outline the landmarks so I'm sure I'll  \n \n          19    miss the vital structures. \n \n          20    Q    Assuming there were a hematoma in some case, what  \n \n          21    effect, if any, would a hematoma have in the execution  \n \n          22    process? \n \n          23    A    It would have none on the execution because this  \n \n          24    catheter end is 16 inches away from where I inserted it and  \n \n          25    it's in a free-flowing vessel.  We can confirm the free-  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             104 \n \n \n \n           1    flowing vessel by aspirating any one of those three ports.   \n \n           2    So if it was kinked, curled, knotted, subcutaneously  \n \n           3    inserted, it would be immediately obvious that it was not  \n \n           4    functioning properly. \n \n           5              MR. PRITCHETT:  That's all I have, Judge.  Thank  \n \n           6    you.   \n \n           7              MS. ANDERS:  Just a couple questions, Judge. \n \n           8    REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. ANDERS:   \n \n           9    Q    So, Doctor, is there a written procedure or regulation  \n \n          10    somewhere that delineates your discretion as to what  \n \n          11    changes you tell the Director of Corrections about? \n \n          12    A    Not yet, but I bet there will be. \n \n          13    Q    So if you had to -- if you had to make a change during  \n \n          14    an execution, say in the heat of the moment, such as you  \n \n          15    mentioned going to neck access, is that something that you  \n \n          16    would tell the Corrections Director about after the fact? \n \n          17    A    I would tell him after I was done, because once I  \n \n          18    start inserting this line I cannot stop.  I have all the  \n \n          19    sterile equipment prepped and ready to go, so I simply take  \n \n          20    the needle and move to the neck area and insert it.  Then I  \n \n          21    would so inform the Director.  In fact, in the instance  \n \n          22    where I did change to a subclavian in the drug addict, I  \n \n          23    immediately informed the Director there was a different  \n \n          24    line and the bandage would be on the inmate's shoulder and  \n \n          25    visible to the gallery, because he was going to immediately  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             105 \n \n \n \n           1    be confronted by gallery, as I call them witnesses, and say  \n \n           2    what was that patch on his shoulder thing, I didn't see  \n \n           3    that before, or what was that, and he would immediately  \n \n           4    know that because of his addiction problem we had to use a  \n \n           5    different type of IV. \n \n           6    Q    I see.  So the one time that you went to neck access,  \n \n           7    that was a subclavian access? \n \n           8    A    Yes.  And immediately informed the Director when I did  \n \n           9    it. \n \n          10    Q    I see.  And does the gurney that's currently in the  \n \n          11    execution room have the capability of tilting? \n \n          12    A    I don't think so, but again we've had two or three  \n \n          13    different gurneys.  If it's a hospital bed, it has a switch  \n \n          14    under the springs that allows me to tilt, or I simply, in  \n \n          15    this case where I put in a subclavian, two of the stronger  \n \n          16    guards simply lifted the bed twelve inches in the air and  \n \n          17    held it while I inserted the needle which took about five,  \n \n          18    ten seconds. \n \n          19    Q    And what kind of lines of communication do you have,  \n \n          20    if any, with the Director during an execution?   \n \n          21    A    There is a radio that's by all senior guards.  It's in  \n \n          22    the room with me.  And there's two or three telephones.   \n \n          23    One is only a direct access to the Director's desk. \n \n          24    Q    And do you use that ever during an execution? \n \n \n          25    A    I have never used it.  I simply inform someone else  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             106 \n \n \n \n           1    what I was doing, or did on the case of the subclavian, but  \n \n           2    I have never had a circumstance arise that I have had to  \n \n           3    talk to him directly. \n \n           4    Q    What type of circumstance do you think would require  \n \n           5    you to talk to him directly? \n \n           6    A    Well, we have gone through so many with so few  \n \n           7    problems, and a lot of it has to do with the sedation that  \n \n           8    we administer before we start the IV, that I can't  \n \n           9    anticipate problems.  That could only occur when the inmate  \n \n          10    is being brought into the room by the six guards, and if  \n \n          11    he's foolish enough to attempt something with those six  \n \n          12    guards, he wouldn't -- once those six guards have him  \n \n          13    strapped down, he is immobilized, arms, legs, wrists,  \n \n          14    ankles, pelvis, knees and shoulders, and by that time I'm  \n \n          15    in and he's aware of who I am, what I'm doing and I'm  \n \n          16    asking him if he's comfortable, if he would like more  \n \n          17    sedation, that I was going to inject a local, it was going  \n \n          18    to sting just slightly and then I was going to insert the  \n \n          19    line and he would not feel anything, and that's about the  \n \n          20    extent of our conversation, and he usually thanks me for  \n \n          21    not hurting him. \n \n          22    Q    Do you know if an anesthesiologist would opt for a  \n \n          23    central line as a method of delivering anesthesia if no  \n \n          24    IV were already in? \n \n          25    A    All anesthesiologists prefer a central line where the  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             107 \n \n \n \n           1    operation will take over an hour. \n \n           2    Q    Do you think they would use it as their first choice  \n \n           3    method of obtaining venous access? \n \n           4    A    Only if it was over an hour, if they anticipated a  \n \n           5    blood transfusion.  For a hernia repair, for routine  \n \n           6    gallbladders, with experienced surgeons, they will not.   \n \n           7    They will only start a peripheral IV with a flexible  \n \n           8    catheter.  Only when you're doing a vascular procedure, a  \n \n           9    colon resection, stomach, total hip, total knee, will they  \n \n          10    require -- hysterectomy, will they require a central line  \n \n          11    or prefer a central line.  Again, it's based on their  \n \n          12    confidence in their surgeon.  There are certain surgeons  \n \n          13    that want a central line on every patient.  Other surgeons,  \n \n          14    they know they can get by with a peripheral IV.  So again  \n \n          15    with this it's their judgment coming into play. \n \n          16    Q    And if an inmate were obese, I think you mentioned  \n \n          17    that you might need to use more thiopental.  If you were  \n \n          18    faced with an obese inmate, would you adjust the dose? \n \n          19    A    If he weighed over 300 pounds, but again if he was six  \n \n          20    foot five and lifted weights every day, he would not be  \n \n          21    considered obese.  So it has more to do with body fat  \n \n          22    rather than total weight.  But I just use the 300 pounds,  \n \n          23    that's what anesthesia uses as a guideline to reconsider if  \n \n          24    they will require additional.  In the clinical practice  \n \n          25    they simply give pentothal until they see the reaction they \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             108 \n \n \n \n           1    want.  In our situation, we have to be prepared to give an  \n \n           2    overdose and we have to calculate what that overdose will  \n \n           3    be. \n \n           4    Q    I see.  And so if you were confronted with an inmate  \n \n           5    who was obese, how much would you want to give? \n \n           6    A    A minimum of three grams is all. \n \n           7    Q    I see.  And would you have the capability of mixing  \n \n           8    three grams? \n \n           9    A    I would then use two syringes of the current solution  \n \n          10    and inform them it was going to take two minutes for the  \n \n          11    first injection and then proceed with the rest of the  \n \n          12    injections to completely assure that there would be no  \n \n          13    problem. \n \n          14    Q    I see.  But I think you testified before that you  \n \n          15    prefer not to change the number of syringes.  \n \n          16    A    I do. \n \n          17    Q    Okay. \n \n          18              MS. ANDERS:  Thank you.  That's all I have,  \n \n          19    Judge. \n \n          20              MR. PRITCHETT:  A couple more, Judge.   \n \n          21    RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. PRITCHETT: \n \n          22    Q    Doctor, if the Director issued an order, either orally  \n \n          23    or in writing, that if you were to change the access from  \n \n          24    femoral access to some other access, and you discovered you  \n \n          25    needed to do it, would you comply with that directive from  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             109 \n \n \n \n \n           1    the Director of the Department of Corrections? \n \n           2    A    Yes.  This central line can actually be inserted in an  \n \n           3    arm and then simply threaded up the arm into a central  \n \n           4    line, which is another possibility we have discussed, if  \n \n           5    for some reason -- but when we present the arguments back  \n \n           6    and forth of central line vs. peripheral line or long  \n \n           7    peripheral lines, this is still the most safest,  \n \n           8    comfortable, reliable way of assuring that we're going to  \n \n           9    effectively administer the drugs in proper sequence and  \n \n          10    expect a very predictable result. \n \n          11              MR. PRITCHETT:  Thank you, Doctor. \n \n          12              THE COURT:  Okay.  On this protective order, as I  \n \n          13    understand your request, it's any information that doesn't  \n \n          14    have a direct bearing on the identity of John Doe 1 ought  \n \n          15    to be subject to the public purview or to your inquiry or  \n \n          16    whatever you want to do with it; is that correct? \n \n          17              MS. ANDERS:  We would certainly not use it for  \n \n          18    any purpose other than this litigation, but I think many  \n \n          19    subjects that we covered --  \n \n          20              THE REPORTER:  I just cannot hear you over there. \n \n          21              MS. ANDERS:  Well, I was saying that plaintiff  \n \n \n          22    and plaintiff's counsel would certainly not use any of this  \n \n          23    deposition for any purpose besides this litigation, but  \n \n          24    there have been many subjects that we have covered in this  \n \n          25    deposition that already are subject to public access  \n \n\n \n \n                                                                             110 \n \n \n \n           1    through the court's filing system because they have been  \n \n           2    covered in the interrogatories.

PRITCHETT:  Judge, it's more logistical than  \n \n \n           6    anything.  If the whole deposition is subject to the  \n \n           7    protective order we don't get into any disagreement among  \n \n           8    the parties as to what's identifying information and what's  \n \n           9    not.  It's just a very bright line. \n \n          10              MS.

If there is any concern about what is or what isn't  \n \n          14    going into the category of the identity of the witness,  \n \n          15    then I urge counsel to consult the court. \n \n          16              MS. ANDERS:  Just to be clear, Judge, so the  \n \n          17    whole deposition won't be subject to the protective order,  \n \n          18    but information that could be used to identify John Doe 1  \n \n          19    could be subject to -- \n \n          20              THE COURT:  I think the way you framed it in your  \n \n          21    motion to the court adequately frames my response, which I  \n \n          22    hope I have already addressed. \n \n          23              MS.

BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff filed his Complaint on June 3, 2005, and an amended complaint on\nSeptember 12, 2005 (Doc. #36)1.  In his First Amended Complaint plaintiff sought a\ndeclaratory judgment that Missouri’s method of execution by lethal injection violates the\nEighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments because it would inflict on him cruel\nand unusual punishment, would deprive him of life, liberty or property without due\nprocess of law and would inflict upon him a badge of slavery, in that the three drug\nsequence using a procedure whereby the drugs are administered through the femoral\nartery creates a foreseeable risk of the infliction of gratuitous pain.  Plaintiff also argued\nthat the physician’s role in the execution violated medical ethics. On December 28,\n2005, the Court issued an Order denying defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and ruling that\nthe case presented factual issues which would likely be resolved by either a motion for\n1 Richard Clay was previously granted leave to intervene in this action.  On\nJanuary 30, 2006, the Court orally granted Mr. Clay’s Motion to Dismiss this action as to\nhim without prejudice.  Reginald Clemons also had a pending Motion for Leave to\nIntervene in this action. He has now also moved to withdraw from this action. \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 2 of 16(cid:10)\nsummary judgment or through a hearing (Doc. # 54).  On January 3, 2006, the\ndefendants notified the Court that the Supreme Court of Missouri had set plaintiff’s\nexecution date for February 1, 2006.  On January 18, 2006, plaintiff filed an Application\nfor a Court Order requesting that the Court issue an Order directing that Taylor not be\nexecuted until further order of the Court to be issued within a reasonable time after a\nhearing on the merits which was scheduled for February 21, 2006.  On January 19,\n2006, Judge Scott Wright issued an Order staying the execution until the Court could\nconduct the hearing (Doc. # 62).  The same day, defendants appealed Judge Wright’s\nruling to the Eighth Circuit.  On January 29, 2006, the Eighth Circuit entered an Order\nreversing and vacating Judge Wright’s January 19, 2006 Order.  The Eighth Circuit\nremanded the case to the Western District and directed that the Court reassign the case\nto another judge for an immediate hearing.  The Eighth Circuit directed that an Order be\nissued no later than 12:00 Noon on Wednesday, February 1, 2006.  This case was\nassigned to this Court on Monday, January 30, 2006. \nOn January 30-31, 2006, this Court conducted a telephonic hearing regarding\nplaintiff’s Complaint.  During the telephonic hearing, the Court heard the testimony of\nthe following individuals: Dr. Mark Dershwitz, Dr. Jonathan I. Groner, Dr. Mark Heath\nand Terry W. Moore, the Director of Adult Institutions for the Missouri Department of\nCorrections. Plaintiff requested that the State produce John Doe Numbers One and Two\n(the doctor and the nurse who participated in the most recent execution), but this\nrequest was denied.  Plaintiff also sought to present the testimony of Dr. Sri Melethil, a\npharmacokineticist, but he was out of town and unable to appear until the morning of\n2\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 3 of 16(cid:10)\nFebruary 1, 2006.   After considering the evidence and the testimony of these\nindividuals, the Court determined that neither the chemicals used by the State for lethal\ninjection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections constituted cruel or\nunusual punishment.  The Court noted that while the plaintiff suggested a different\napproach to lethal injection, he had not shown that the current method used by Missouri\nviolated the Eighth Amendment.  Further the Court was not persuaded that the use of\nthe femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violated applicable\nstandards of the Eighth Amendment.  The Court also did not find that Missouri\nphysicians who are involved in administering lethal injections were violating their ethical\nobligations or that the procedure was violative of the Thirteenth Amendment.\nPlaintiff appealed this Court’s January 31, 2006 Order, arguing that he did not\nhave sufficient time to present his arguments to the Court during the two day telephonic\nhearing.  Plaintiff argued that this Court had abused its discretion in not allowing him to\ncall John Doe I and II or Dr. Melethil and also erred in denying his claims.  On April 27,\n2006, the Eighth Circuit remanded the case to this Court to reconvene the hearing.  The\nEighth Circuit gave the parties thirty days to engage in some limited additional discovery\nand then an additional thirty days within which the hearing was to be held and for this\nCourt to issue its Order, amending, modifying or restating the previous judgment and\ncertifying the same to the Eighth Circuit.\nThe Court allowed plaintiff to conduct the following discovery: a Rule 34\ninspection and videotaped tour of Missouri’s execution chamber, a deposition of Larry\nCrawford, Director of the Missouri Department of Corrections and document requests\n3\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 4 of 16(cid:10)\nwhich pertained to the last six executions carried out by the State of Missouri.  The\ndocument requests included any execution logs, records, autopsy reports, test results\nand analyses of post-mortem/toxicology reports.  The State also provided information\nregarding what specialized training the physicians and nurses undergo who participate\nin administration of  the drugs and all documents pertaining to any fall back procedures\nregarding vein access and the three drug sequence. The Court also allowed plaintiff to\nsubmit interrogatories to John Doe Defendants I - V.  After John Doe I submitted his\ninterrogatory responses, plaintiff again asked the Court for permission to depose him. \nThe Court allowed plaintiff to conduct a limited anonymous deposition of John Doe I. \nThis deposition was conducted at the Courthouse, with only the Court and counsel\npresent.  On June 12 -13, 2006 this Court continued the hearing which was begun in\nJanuary 2006.  During the hearing, plaintiff presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Heath,\nan anesthesiologist,  Dr. Stephen Johnson, an expert in central line placement and\nfemoral line placement and Dr. Thomas Henthorn, an expert in pharmokinetics.  The\nState presented the testimony of Dr. Mark Dershwitz, an anesthesiologist, Terry Moore,\nDirector of Adult Institutions for Department of Corrections and Larry Crawford, Director\nof the Department of Corrections.  \nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard\nThe Eighth Amendment provides that “cruel and unusual punishment” shall not\nbe inflicted.  It  prohibits punishments that are “incompatible with the ‘evolving standards\n4\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’” Estelle v. Gamble 429 U.S.\n97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86,\n101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)).  As to executions, it prohibits “the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” as well as methods involving torture or a\nlingering death.  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 49\nL.Ed.2d 859 (1976).  “The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted\nman is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering\ninvolved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.”  Louisiana ex rel. Francis\nv. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464, 67 S.Ct. 374, 376, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947)(emphasis\nadded).  Additionally, as the Court noted in Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir.\n1994), “[t]he risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution\nprocess in order to survive constitutional review.”   \nB. Missouri’s Execution Procedure\nDuring the January 30-31, 2006 hearing, Terry Moore, Director of Adult\nInstitutions for the Missouri Department of Corrections, described what he believed was\nthe execution procedure used in Missouri.  Mr. Moore testified that three drugs are\nadministered by a board certified physician.  The physician first administers five grams\nof sodium pentothal, also known as thiopental, which is a substance that produces\nanesthesia.  Thereafter, the physician administers a syringe of saline to flush the IV line. \nNext, the physician administers pancuronium bromide, also referred to as pancuronium. \nThis drug is a paralytic agent which prevents any involuntary movement of the body. \nThe physician then again administers the saline solution.  Finally, the third drug which is\n5\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\nadministered is potassium chloride, which is a drug which stops the electrical activity of\nthe heart.  There was no dispute that if an inmate is not sufficiently anesthetized when\nthe potassium chloride is administered, it will cause excruciating pain as it is\nadministered through the inmate’s veins.   The inmate, however, would be unable to\nshow that he was experiencing discomfort due to the paralyzing effects of the\npancuronium bromide.  \nAfter the Eighth Circuit remanded this case, the Court allowed plaintiff to conduct\nadditional limited discovery.  In a letter sent to the Court on May 17, 2006, plaintiff’s\ncounsel informed the Court that new evidence in the form of chemical dispensary logs,\nwhich had recently been produced by the State, contradicted the State’s previous\nrepresentations regarding the amount of thiopental that is used during executions.   \nIn response, counsel for the State confirmed in a letter sent to the Court on May\n17, 2006 that 5 grams of sodium pentothal are used:\nAs plaintiff correctly points out, defendants have stated consistently that 5\ngrams of sodium pentothal are used in executions in Missouri.  Five grams\nare in fact used. The reference to the 2.5 grams noted in the drug log is\nnot correct.  The doctor and the nurse who have prepared the drugs for\nthe last six executions and for plaintiff’s stayed execution confirm that 5\ngrams has been used in the last six executions and was prepared for\nplaintiff’s stayed execution.  (Defendants are attempting to run down the\nsource of the error in the record, and continue to do so.) \nHowever, the next day on May 18, 2006, counsel for the State sent the Court\nanother letter in which they acknowledge that a mistake had in fact been made\nregarding the representations as to the amount of thiopental administered.  The letter\nstated in part:\nUpon further review, defendants have just determined this afternoon,\n6\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\ncontrary to previous representations, that 2.5 grams of sodium pentothal\nwas prepared and used at the last execution (not 5 grams) and that 2.5\ngrams was prepared for use at the execution of plaintiff (which was stayed\nbefore the femoral IV was inserted).  Defendants and their counsel\napologize to the Court and the parties for providing incorrect information. \n(Doc. # 121). \nUpon learning of this information, the Court submitted a set of interrogatories to\nJohn Doe I 2 to answer.  The Court inquired whether the lethal injection protocol was\ncodified in any publication, policy statement or state regulation.  John Doe I responded\nthat he was not aware of the protocol being written down in any form.  He stated that it\nwas his understanding at the time of Mr. Gray’s execution that he had the independent\nauthority to change the dose based on his medical judgment.  He stated that this\nunderstanding was based on past contacts with predecessors of the current Director of\nthe Department of Corrections.  When the Court asked how many times the protocol\nhas been modified since it was put into place, John Doe I responded:\nJohn Doe I can recall one instance when three syringes of potassium\nchloride were used based on the obesity of the offender.  John Doe I can\nrecall one instance when the IV was inserted in the offender’s neck\ninstead of his femoral vein based on the damage to both of his femoral\nveins from drug abuse.  John Doe I is aware of one instance when a\nperipheral IV was used because John Doe I was unable to attend the\nexecution.  For the execution of Mr. Gray and the preparation for the\nexecution of Mr. Taylor, John Doe I determined to use 2.5 grams of\nsodium pentothal. This determination occurred because of difficulty in\ndissolving powder, obtained from a new supplier, containing more than 2.5\ngrams in the liquid that could be accommodated in a syringe. The rate of\ninfusion and the concentration of the dose ensured that 2.5 grams was\nmore than sufficient to make the offender unconscious before\nadministering the remaining drugs.  Further, with regard to Mr. Taylor,\nJohn Doe I was aware that the dosage used in the execution of Mr. Gray\nwas adequate. \n(Response to Interrogatory No. 5, Doc. # 152). \n2Defendants have disclosed that John Doe I is the physician that mixes the drugs\nused during the executions. \n7\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 8 of 16(cid:10)\nWhen asked who was consulted before the dosage of thiopental was decreased,\nhe responded that no one was consulted because he thought it was within the\nacceptable parameters to accomplish the goal.  When questioned about his medical\nbackground, John Doe stated that although he was a board certified surgeon, he is not\nan anesthesiologist. The Court also allowed plaintiff to conduct an anonymous\ndeposition of John Doe I on June 5, 2006.\nWhen he was asked whether any part of the execution procedure was written\ndown, John Doe I responded as follows:\nA.  I have never seen it.  If it was, it would have been written on my recommendation.\nQ.  I see.  Do you have any idea why it might not be written down?\nA.  I’m sure it’s written down somewhere. If they’re checking the logs of all the drugs\nevery time we use them and recording expiration dates and number of sheets and\nneedles that we use, I’m certain they have it written down somewhere.\nQ.  But in terms of the aspects of the procedure that you’re responsible for, that you\nperform, those aren’t written down, to your knowledge? \nA.  It might be written in there, but it would be written on by somebody observing what I\nwas doing and using their interpretation.  So if there was a written procedure that they\nhad done I would  – you know, I’m curious to see what they think I’m doing, but I don’t\nknow that they write down the individual details of how I insert an 18-gauge rather than\na 22-gauge or a 14-gauge needle. \nQ.  I see.  So people might write things down as you’re doing them, but there’s no guide\nthat you follow as you’re doing it?\nA.  Absolutely not. \nQ.  So you just rely on your memory?\nA.  Yes.\nQ.  And your judgment?\nA.  Yes. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 69-70)\n  During his deposition, John Doe I described how he has had to devise an\nimprovised procedure with regard to mixing the correct dosage of thiopental:\nQ. And could you take me step-by-step through that, your improvised process? \nA. I’d have to see the containers because I cannot at the present time remember\nwhether they have glass or – they are actually just two straight-walled glass\nbottles. One has powder in the bottom, one has liquid in the bottom, and they are\ndesigned to lock together and mix.  So, I have to stick a needle through this\n8\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 9 of 16(cid:10)\nplastic and inject my own diluents which I know will give me no more than 50 cc’s\nfor the final product, which is what I’m aiming for for the final injection. \nWe have encountered problems trying to mix more than three or four\ngrams using this method, mainly because of an inert substance possibly put in \nby the manufacturer to prevent mis-mixing, which I know several drug companies\nwill do.  So right now the last time I saw and talked to the Director on each of\nthese occasions saying we either need to change what we say we’re dosing or\nwe will have to go back to the original five-gram bottle that was available when\nwe instituted this procedure.  So right now we’re still improvising.  And he’s also\nhaving me researching an alternate drug if it comes to that. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 9-10).   \nWhen John Doe I was asked why he did not initially recall why he prepared a\nsmaller dose of thiopental, he responded:\nA. . . . But I am dyslexic and so I can recall in the operating room specific facts and\ndetails of operation and function perfectly, but in terms of copying one line to\nanother or trying to simply copy a phone number or account number I will\nsometimes transpose numbers even when I’m staring at the two numbers.  So,\nit’s not unusual for me to make mistakes. . . . But I am dyslexic and that is the\nreason why there are inconsistencies in my testimony.  That’s why there are\ninconsistencies in what I call drugs. I can make these mistakes, but it’s not\nmedically crucial in the type of work I do as a surgeon. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 24-25)(emphasis added).\nIn describing how the drugs are administered, John Doe I stated that, “ . . .the\npeople who do the injections are nonmedical and they’re in the dark so they have a\nsmall flashlight that they’re able to quickly identify the syringes, make the appropriate\nconnections and injections, disconnect, clamp the tube, and changing the number of\nsyringes or the order of syringes was an unnecessary risk.”  (John Doe Depo. p. 31). \nWhen questioned about whether he monitors anesthetic depth, John Doe I\ntestified as follows: \nQ. Did you monitor Mr. Gray’s anesthetic depth during the execution? \nA. I monitor – the only thing that can be monitored is facial expression, and you can\njudge when the effect of the drug is accomplished, and that can be seen from across a\nroom through a window. And when that effect occurs then I know the inmate is\nunconscious. . . .\n9\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 10 of 16(cid:10)\nQ. So you said that you can see that – an inmate’s facial expression from where you\nstand? \nA. Yes.  That’s the only thing any anesthesiologist uses in the course of inducing a\nperson when pentothal was still used, was you simply started injecting, look at the face,\nand again, it’s difficult to describe, but I can tell instantly when the pentothal has taken\neffect. And in medical practice the instant the pentothal has taken effect they gave\nabsolutely no more because then they move on to the actual anesthesia which has to\nbe started before the pentothal wears off. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 41-42). \nWhen he was asked whether he had any discussions with Director Crawford\nabout the scope of his authority, John Doe I stated:\nA.  Oh, yes.  We talk – I talk in his office and at the time of the execution.  In fact, he’s\nthe only director I have actually gone over to his office for other reasons and visited\nabout this.  And again, he has no background in corrections and he has no background\nin medicine, so the other corrections officers had long backgrounds in corrections so\nthey were aware of what we were doing and why we were doing it.  Since he has no\nbackground in either field, he reiterated that he’s totally dependent on me advising him\nwhat could and should and will be done, and he will back up – if I think there’s a change\nthat needs to be made, he wants me to quickly inform him so he can make the\nappropriate changes. \nQ.  I see. So, it’s your understanding that if you thought a change to the execution\nprocedure needed to be made you would – Director Crawford would defer to your\nopinion? \nA.  Absolutely. \n(John Doe Depo. pp. 63-64). \nC. Is Missouri’s Execution Procedure Constitutional?  \nIn Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp.2d 1037 (N.D.Cal. 2006), aff’d, 438 F.3d 926\n(9th Cir. 2006), cert. denied,126 S.Ct.1314,163 L.Ed.2d 1148 (2006), the Court stated:\n     The Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments that are incompatible\nwith the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society. . . . Executions that involve the unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain . . . or that involve torture or a lingering death . . . are not\npermitted.  When analyzing a particular method of execution or the\nimplementation thereof, it is appropriate to focus on the objective evidence\nof the pain involved. . . .In this case, the Court must determine whether\nPlaintiff is subject to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain or\nsuffering such that his execution by lethal injection under California’s\nprotocol must be restrained. \n10\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 11 of 16(cid:10)\nId. at 1039 (internal citations and quotations omitted)(emphasis added). In that case the\nCourt focused on the narrow issue of “whether or not there is a reasonable possibility\nthat Plaintiff will be conscious when he is injected with pancuronium bromide or\npotassium chloride, and, if so, how the risk of such an occurrence may be avoided.”  Id.\nat 1040.  This is precisely the same question which this Court must address.\nAfter learning more about how executions are carried out in Missouri,  through\nthe interrogatories submitted to the John Doe defendants, reviewing the chemical\ndispensary logs, reviewing the videotape of the execution chamber and listening to the\ntestimony of John Doe I, and to the testimony of the other expert witnesses at the June\n12-13, 2006 hearing, it is apparent that there are numerous problems.  For example,\nthere is no written protocol which describes which drugs will be administered, in what\namounts and defines how they will be administered.  John Doe I testified that he came\nup with the current protocol.  John Doe I also testified that he felt that he had the\nauthority to change or modify the formula as he saw fit.  It is apparent that he has\nchanged and modified the protocol on several occasions in the past.  He has reduced\nthe amount of thiopental given from 5.0 grams to 2.5 grams and has also changed the\nlocation on the inmate’s body where the drugs were administered.  It is obvious that the\nprotocol as it currently exists is not carried out consistently and is subject to change at a\nmoment’s notice. \nThe Court is also concerned that John Doe I possesses total discretion for the\nexecution protocol.  Currently, there are no checks and balances or oversight, either\nbefore, during or after the lethal injection occurs.  No one monitors the changes or\nmodifications that John Doe I makes.  John Doe I even testified that the Director of the\nDepartment of Corrections, Mr. Crawford, has no medical or corrections background,\n11\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 12 of 16(cid:10)\nand that he is “totally dependent on me advising him.”  (John Doe Depo. p. 64).\nIn addition to the fact that there is no oversight and the responsibility for making\nchanges or adjustments is completely vested in one individual, the Court also has\nconcerns about John Doe I’s qualifications.  John Doe I readily admitted that he is\ndyslexic and that he has difficulty with numbers and oftentimes transposes numbers. \nJohn Doe I testified “it’s not unusual for me to make mistakes. . . . But I am dyslexic and\nthat is the reason why there are inconsistencies in my testimony.  That’s why there are\ninconsistencies in what I call drugs.  I can make these mistakes, but it’s not medically\ncrucial in the type of work I do as a surgeon.”  (John Doe Depo. p. 25).  The Court\ndisagrees and is gravely concerned that a physician who is solely responsible for\ncorrectly mixing the drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of\ncondemned inmates has a condition which causes him confusion with regard to\nnumbers.  As the Court has learned, the process of mixing the three different drugs and\nknowing the correct amount of the drugs to dissolve in the correct amount of solution\ninvolves precise measurements and the ability to use, decipher, and not confuse\nnumbers.  Although John Doe I does not feel this is crucial in the type of work he does\nas a surgeon, it is critical when one is mixing and dissolving chemicals for a lethal\ninjection.  \nIn addition, John Doe I testified that although he is not an anesthesiologist, he\nmonitors the anesthetic depth of an inmate by observing the inmate’s facial expression. \nHowever, as can be seen from the videotape of the execution chamber, when the\ninmate is lying on the gurney in the execution room, the inmate is facing away from the\nOperations room where John Doe I is located.  Additionally, it is dark in the Operations\nroom and there are blinds on the window which are partially closed and obstruct the\n12\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 13 of 16(cid:10)\nview.  This would make it almost impossible for John Doe I to observe the inmate’s\nfacial expression.  This leads the Court to conclude that there is little or no monitoring of\nthe inmate to ensure that he has received an adequate dose of anesthesia before the\nother two chemicals are administered. \nAll of these concerns lead the Court to conclude that Missouri’s lethal injection\nprocedure subjects condemned inmates to an unnecessary risk that they will be subject\nto unconstitutional pain and suffering when the lethal injection drugs are administered.   \nD.  Revisions to the Execution Protocol\nHaving determined that Missouri’s current method of administering lethal\ninjections subjects condemned inmates to an unacceptable risk of suffering\nunconstitutional pain and suffering, the Court concludes that it is within its equitable\npowers to fashion a remedy that “preserves both the State’s interest in proceeding with\nPlaintiff’s execution and Plaintiff’s constitutional right not to be subject to an undue risk\nof extreme pain.”  Morales, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1046.  Director Crawford testified at the\nhearing that the Department of Corrections is in the process of developing a directive\nwhich would establish a protocol for administering lethal injections.  However, from his\ntestimony, it was apparent that the directive would not encompass all of the attributes\nwhich the Court finds are necessary to ensure that lethal injections are carried out\nhumanely.   Recently other courts have also faced this challenge and have modified\nexecution procedures in those states.  See e.g. Brown v. Beck, No. 5:06-CT-3018-H,\n(E.D.N.C. April 7, 2006)(Doc. No. 32) and Morales, 415 F.Supp.2d at 1046. \nAccordingly, the Court hereby AMENDS its previous order of January 31, 2006\nand ORDERS the Department of Corrections for the State of Missouri to prepare a\n13\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 14 of 16(cid:10)\nwritten protocol for the implementation of lethal injections which incorporates the\nfollowing provisions:\n1.  Personnel\n     A board certified anesthesiologist shall be responsible for the mixing of all drugs\nwhich are used in the lethal injection process.  If the anesthesiologist does not actually\nadminister the drugs through the IV, he or she shall directly observe those individuals\nwho do so.  Additionally, the Operations Room shall be sufficiently lighted so that the\ncorrections personnel can see which drugs are being administered. \n2.   Lethal Injection Drugs & Method of Administration\n      The level of thiopental administered shall not be less than 5 grams.  Pancuronium\nBromide and Potassium Chloride will not be administered until the anesthesiologist \ncertifies that the inmate has achieved sufficient anesthetic depth so that the inmate will\nnot feel any undue pain when the Potassium Chloride is injected.  The State in\nconjunction with the anesthesiologist will have discretion to determine the most\nappropriate location on the inmate’s body to inject the drugs. The State shall specify in\nthe protocol how the anesthesiologist will certify that the inmate has achieved the\nappropriate anesthetic depth.      \n3.   Monitoring\n      The State will put in place procedures which will allow the anesthesiologist to\nadequately monitor the anesthetic depth of the inmate.  This may require the State to\npurchase additional equipment in order to adequately monitor anesthetic depth.  The\nState should also consider repositioning the gurney so that the inmates’s face will be\nvisible to the anesthesiologist, using a mirror, or even allowing the anesthesiologist to\nbe present in the room with the inmate when the drugs are injected.    \n14\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 15 of 16(cid:10)\n4.  Contingency Plan\n      The State’s protocol shall also contain a contingency plan in case problems develop\nduring the execution procedure. \n5.  Auditing Process\nThe Department of Corrections shall put in place an auditing process which will\nensure that the individuals involved in the lethal injection process are correctly following\nthe protocol, including administering the correct dosages of the medication, in the\nproper order.  The Court contemplates that the State will consult with a board certified\nanesthesiologist in designing the auditing process.\n6.  Changes to the Lethal Injection Procedure\nAfter approval by the Court, no further changes shall be made to the lethal\ninjection protocol without seeking the prior approval of this Court. This Order\ncontemplates consultation with a board certified anesthesiologist in arriving at a\nproposed written protocol. The Court will retain jurisdiction over the State's\nimplementation of the lethal injection protocol for the next six executions or until the\nCourt is satisfied that the protocol is being administered in a consistent fashion. The\nDepartment of Corrections shall submit its revised lethal execution protocol to this Court\nfor review and approval on or before July 15, 2006.  All executions in the State of\nMissouri are hereby STAYED pending approval of the protocol. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court hereby AMENDS its January 31, 2006\nOrder and in accordance with the April 27, 2006 Order of the Eighth Circuit, this Court \n15\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 195     Filed 06/26/2006     Page 16 of 16(cid:10)\nhereby CERTIFIES this Order to the Eighth Circuit for its review and consideration. \nDate: June 26, 2006          S/ FERNANDO J.

Instead of taking this opportunity to embark on \na considered process of meaningful reform, the State has failed outright to address many \ndeficiencies and papered over others.  The result is not a true execution protocol -- which should \ntake the form of a set of step-by-step instructions that can be followed precisely by the execution \nteam -- but rather a set of provisions that only vaguely describes what personnel might do, or \nsimply parrots the Order’s language without explaining whether or how Defendants will actually \nalter their practices.  The State’s proposed protocol, if one can call it that, thus utterly fails to \nprotect inmates from the errors, ad hoc improvisations, and poor judgment of inadequately \ntrained personnel forced to carry out executions without adequate guidance. \n  Part I of this Opposition argues that this Court should reject the State’s proposed protocol \nfor two reasons.  First, the State has not complied with many aspects of the Order, including its \nrequirement that the State include a board-certified anesthesiologist.  Instead, the State would \nallow any physician (including John Doe I), nurse, or even EMT to carry out the execution.  \nSecond, the proposed protocol is not an acceptable alternative to the Court’s requirements \nbecause it perpetuates the unnecessary risk of excruciating pain present in the State’s procedures \nto date, see Heath Decl. ¶ 2 (Exh. A), and thus does not comply with the Eighth Amendment.  \nPart II argues that this Court should reject the State’s claim that it was legal error to require the \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 5 of 20(cid:10)\n \nparticipation of an anesthesiologist in its execution procedure.    \nI.    THE STATE’S PROPOSED PROTOCOL MUST BE REJECTED. \nA.  Monitoring Anesthetic Depth. \n  Plaintiff established at trial that so long as potassium chloride is used in the execution \nprocedure, it is necessary to induce general anesthesia to prevent the inmate from being \nsubjected to the excruciating pain caused by the potassium.  Trial Tr. 14; Heath Decl. ¶ 4.  \nAssessing anesthetic depth is imperative, because the substandard practices of catheterization \nand drug administration used for executions create a significant and unnecessary likelihood that \nthe intended dose of anesthetic will not in fact reach the inmate’s circulatory system.1  Id. ¶ 9.     \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Court’s Order. \n  This Court ordered Defendants to adopt procedures to require a board-certified \nanesthesiologist to “adequately monitor the anesthetic depth of the inmate.”  Order at 14.  As this \nCourt noted, Defendants have to this point performed “little or no monitoring of the inmate to \nensure that he has received an adequate dose of anesthesia.”  Id. at 13.  The requirement of \n“adequate” monitoring necessarily entails having a board-certified anesthesiologist exercise his \nor her medical judgment as to how, and with what equipment, to monitor anesthetic depth, given \nthe execution set-up and the excruciating pain that could be caused by potassium. \n  Defendants clearly have not complied with this crucial aspect of the Court’s Order.  \nRather than use a board-certified anesthesiologist, Defendants propose to use a physician, nurse \n                                                 \n1 Defendants, however, consistently refuse to acknowledge this basic point, arguing that “if five \ngrams of thiopental is administered, there would be no need to monitor the anesthetic depth of \nthe condemned.”  Defs. Mem. at 8.  As Defendants’ own qualification implies, the need to \nmonitor anesthetic depth arises from uncertainty regarding whether five grams of thiopental have \nin fact been administered into the inmate’s circulation – where it must arrive in order to have any \neffect – and whether the thiopental has had the expected effect of causing unconsciousness.  \nTrial. Tr. 253-56. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 6 of 20(cid:10)\n \nor EMT to monitor anesthetic depth.  Such personnel lack the years of advanced training in \nanesthesiology that inform the decisions and performance of a board-certified anesthesiologist.  \nSee Heath Decl. ¶¶ 11-12. \n  2.  The State’s Proposed Alternative Creates An Unnecessary Risk Of Pain. \n  The State’s proposed method of using “[a] physician, nurse, or emergency medical \ntechnician” to assess anesthetic depth in a manner prescribed by the State, see Protocol ¶ A.3, \nfails to minimize the risk that inmates will be subject to excruciating pain.  It is therefore not an \nadequate substitute for the procedure ordered by the Court.   \n  First, Defendants propose to use personnel untrained in anesthesiology to perform the \nmonitoring function.  Assessing and monitoring anesthetic depth is “inherently a complex task \nthat requires the real-time and continuous integration of multiple lines of evidence and \ninformation.”  Heath Expert Report ¶ 17.  Nurses, EMTs, and physicians who are not \nanesthesiologists all lack the advanced training in anesthesiology that is necessary to properly \ninterpret the subtle indicia of consciousness, and therefore will not be able to accurately and \nreliably monitor anesthetic depth.2  See Heath Decl. ¶¶ 11-12; Trial Tr. 26.   \n  Second, the means of anesthetic monitoring that Defendants propose are completely \ninadequate to ensure that an inmate has reached, and remains in, a surgical plane of anesthesia.  \nAs Plaintiff has established, the injection of a high concentration of potassium into the veins is \nexcruciatingly painful, akin to a surgical incision.  Trial Tr. 57-60.  Because anesthesia has many \nlevels, an inmate can be lightly anesthetized, and therefore not responsive to mild stimuli (such \n                                                 \n2 Perhaps most disturbing is the State’s statement that it might perform executions with only an \nEMT present.  EMTs in Missouri may provide patient care only under the supervision of a \ndoctor, 19 Mo. Code State Regs. § 30-40.303 -- which they would not have if no doctor were \npresent at the execution.  In addition, EMTs are trained to provide specific types of emergency \ncare, and thus are not trained in inducing and monitoring anesthetic depth.  See Heath Decl. ¶ 11. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 7 of 20(cid:10)\n \nas voice or touch), but still be fully aware of more painful stimuli.  Heath Decl. ¶ 22.  Thus, any \nassessment of anesthetic depth must effectively test whether the inmate is able to feel pain \nequivalent to surgery.   \n  Instead of leaving assessment of anesthetic depth to an anesthesiologist who would be \nable to bring extensive training to bear on the task, the DOC has simply copied a non-exclusive \nlist of monitoring techniques from a Practice Advisory meant for an audience of \nanesthesiologists.  See Exh. 3 to Heath Decl.; Heath Decl. ¶¶ 15-23; Protocol ¶ E.3.  The listed \ntechniques, however, each have a specific purpose, and provide specific types of information to \nanesthesiologists, who have the tools necessary to interpret them.  Some are effective only for \nmeasuring very shallow levels of unconsciousness.  Heath Decl. ¶ 22.  Using untrained personnel \nto employ some or all of the listed techniques, with no understanding of “what information each \ntechnique can provide and how each fits in to the broad suite of assessment techniques,” id., is \nwholly inadequate to ensure that the inmate is in fact sufficiently anesthetized.    \n  Although the proposed protocol also appears to provide for remote monitoring of the \ninmate’s face from the execution support room, see Protocol ¶ D.2, such monitoring will be \nineffective, particularly after the pancuronium has paralyzed the inmate’s face muscles.  See \nHeath Decl. ¶ 23; Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring, attached as Exh. 4 to Heath Decl. \n(“Qualified anesthesia personnel shall be present in the room throughout the conduct of all \ngeneral anesthetics . . . .”).  Thus, this aspect of the proposal does not provide a substitute for \nbedside monitoring of the inmate by an anesthesiologist.  Id.  \nFinally, the State offers no detail as to how it has improved the view from the support \nroom to allow adequate monitoring, merely stating that “the gurney is positioned so that the \nmedical personnel can observe the prisoner’s face directly or with the aid of a mirror.”  See \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\n \nProtocol ¶ D.2. 3  At a minimum, the vagueness of the State’s representation indicates that it has \nnot thought through how it actually will implement this part of the procedure.4  Even more \ndisturbingly, given that John Doe I already represented, incorrectly, that the prior set-up afforded \nan adequate view of the inmate’s face, see, e.g., Doe I Depo. Tr. at 41-42, it is entirely possible \nthat the State has changed nothing at all or has made changes that are not meaningful.    \nB.  IV Access. \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Order. \n \n  This Court’s Order provides that the State, in conjunction with an anesthesiologist, will \nhave discretion to determine the site of IV access.  See Order at 14.  The State has procured no \nanesthesiologist and therefore cannot comply with this portion of the Court’s Order.   \n  2.  The State’s Proposed Alternative Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Pain.   \n \n  Defendants’ proposed plan for obtaining IV access is seriously flawed.  First, the protocol \nfails to ensure that the process of inserting the IVs will be safe and humane.  Although the \nprotocol on its face provides medical personnel with discretion to determine the “most \nappropriate” location in which to insert the catheter, it does not specify whether the most \n“appropriate” location will be determined based on the medical judgment of a qualified \nindividual.  This vagueness is particularly disturbing in light of John Doe I’s previous \nprioritization of aesthetic concerns -- speed of injection and concealment of the IV site -- in \nchoosing the femoral line as the automatic means of IV access.  See Doe I Depo Tr. 87, 104-05. \nIn fact, the protocol explicitly reserves the execution team’s right to place central lines, \n                                                 \n3 Because the view of the inmate’s face from the execution support room was obstructed, this \nCourt noted that the State may have to reposition the gurney in order to render the inmate’s face \nvisible.  See Order at 12, 14.   \n4 Moving the gurney could affect other elements of the execution set-up, such as the length of the \nIV tubing. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\n \neven when they are not medically necessary.5  Every type of central line is significantly more \ninvasive than a peripheral line, and involves potentially agonizing complications.  Heath Decl. \n¶ 28.  It is inhumane, therefore, to determine whether to use a central line based on \nconsiderations other than medical necessity.6  Id. ¶ 25. \n  In addition, the protocol does not specify when the catheter site will be chosen.  This is a \ndetermination that could be made ahead of time, based on an examination of the inmate, and \nneed not be an on-the-spot decision.  Id. ¶ 30.  The protocol fails to recognize that allowing \nmedical personnel to decide to place a central line once the inmate is already on the gurney could \nforce personnel to perform the catheterization without the equipment necessary to treat the \ncomplications that could arise.  Id. \n  These dangers are compounded by the fact that the protocol contemplates that personnel \nwithout current and regular experience placing central lines could have sole discretion over these \naspects of the procedure.  Nurses and EMTs alone do not place central lines, or determine that a \ncentral line is necessary, except in emergency circumstances.  Id. ¶ 27.  Many doctors do not \nregularly place central lines, and therefore are not proficient in the procedures.  Trial Tr. 53.  \nDelegating authority to these personnel to place central lines, perhaps without advance planning \nand the necessary equipment, creates a significant and unnecessary risk that the inmate will \nexperience excruciating pain and complications from the IV procedure itself. \n  Second, these same inadequacies substantially increase the likelihood that the IV will not \nbe a reliable one.  Id. ¶¶ 24, 31.  Plaintiff previously proffered substantial evidence regarding the \n                                                 \n5 The protocol specifies that the backup line will always be peripheral, Protocol ¶ C.1, even if the \nprimary IV is central -- which necessarily means that Defendants contemplate inserting central \nlines in inmates whose peripheral veins are undamaged. \n6 John Doe I believed that the invasive and risky femoral line was the most appropriate because \nthe catheter site could be hidden from view under a sheet and the line would allow a very quick \ninjection.  Doe, Depo Tr. at 104-05.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 10 of 20(cid:10)\n \npotential that an IV line could become dislodged, infiltrated, or blocked, even when the \ncatheterization is performed by a board-certified surgeon.  Trial Tr. 77-82.  These dangers are \nexacerbated by the proposed protocol, and by existing deficiencies in the procedure, such as the \nuse of a sheet that hides the catheter site and IV tubing from view.7 \nC.  Mixing the Chemicals. \n \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Order. \n \n  This Court required that a board-certified anesthesiologist mix the drugs.  See Order at \n14.  Instead, acknowledging that it has failed to comply with this requirement, the State has \ndecided that a “physician, nurse, or pharmacist [will] prepare[] the chemicals.”  Protocol ¶ A.2; \nDefs. Mem. at 4.  The State thus leaves open the door for John Doe I to continue to do the \nmixing.  This Court was “gravely concerned that a physician who is solely responsible for \ncorrectly mixing drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of condemned \ninmates” was unable to mix the thiopental correctly.  Order at 12.  The State flouts this concern \nby allowing the mixing to be performed by this very individual. \n  Adequate provision for proper mixing of the thiopental is crucial to complying with the \nCourt’s requirement that the “thiopental administered shall not be less than 5 grams.”  Id. at 14. \nThe State’s proposal states that it will use 5 grams, see Protocol ¶ B.2, but its lack of detail \nregarding the mixing procedure fails to guarantee that it will in fact successfully mix that \namount.  This concern is a very real one, as the State was unable to ensure that 5 grams would be \nmixed in previous executions, and previously used a type of thiopental kit that made mixing a \nlarger-than-normal dose more difficult.  See Heath Decl. ¶ 37.  There is no indication that the \n                                                 \n7 That the State indicates it will inspect the catheter site when it checks anesthetic depth, see \nProtocol ¶ E.3, is not sufficient to guard against other foreseeable problems that might arise, such \nas leaks or kinks in the tubing.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 11 of 20(cid:10)\n \nDOC has considered or addressed these issues.  See id. ¶ 36-37.  The State’s failure to protect \nagainst ad hoc deviations from the mixing procedure, and the participation therein of John Doe I, \nthus prevent the State from effectively guaranteeing that 5 grams will in fact be prepared and \nadministered.  \n  2.  The State’s Proposed Alternative Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Pain.   \n \n  John Doe I’s participation, of course, raises special concerns that the State will fail to mix \n5 grams of thiopental.  But even if he does not perform the mixing, the State’s proposal fails to \nprovide adequate assurance that the drugs will be successfully mixed.  The State contemplates \nusing personnel with little to no experience in mixing drugs to perform the task, see Protocol \n¶ A.2, but has provided no instructions on how to perform the mixing.  See Heath Decl. ¶ 36.  \nBecause personnel must prepare a dose of thiopental that is much larger than the standard \nclinical dose for which thiopental kits are designed, the mixer must deviate from the mechanical \ninstructions provided in the package insert.  See id.  The State then creates a significant risk that \nuntrained personnel will improvise a mixing process, leading to mistakes and an inability to \nprepare a full dose of anesthetic.  Id. ¶ 37-38.   \nD.  Drug Administration. \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Order. \n \n  This Court required an anesthesiologist either to administer the drugs or directly oversee \nthose individuals who do so.  Order at 14.  It further required the anesthesiologist to certify that \nthe inmate has achieved sufficient anesthetic depth before the injection of the pancuronium \nbromide and potassium chloride.  Id.  Obviously, the State has failed to comply with this Court’s \ndirection that an anesthesiologist participate in the administration of the drugs, and certify \nanesthetic depth before the injection of the second and third drugs.  The protocol also fails to \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 12 of 20(cid:10)\n \nspecify how certification of anesthetic depth should be communicated to each member of the \nexecution team before the injection of the other drugs.   \n  The Court also requires the Operations Room to be “sufficiently lighted so that the \ncorrections personnel can see which drugs are being administered.”  Id.  The proposed protocol \nmerely parrots this language, stating that “[t]he lights in the execution support room are \nmaintained at a sufficient level to permit proper administration of the chemicals.”  Protocol \n¶ E.1.  This statement does not indicate how -- or even whether -- the State will adjust the \nlighting, or how the adjusted lighting will interact with the State’s anonymity concerns.  Clearly, \nthe State has not actually thought through what constitutes sufficient lighting, and thus has not \nmeaningfully complied with the Court’s order.    \n  2.  The State’s Proposed Alternative Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Pain.   \n \n  The fact that the protocol is silent regarding precisely how the drugs will be administered \nand how the IV equipment and gurney will be set up leads to the conclusion that Defendants \nintend to retain many of the dangerous elements of their existing execution procedure.  Plaintiff \npreviously offered extensive evidence regarding the numerous failings of the procedure, \nincluding remote drug administration, the failure to use an IV drip to ensure the patency of the \nIV line,8 the inability to see the inmate clearly through the one-way glass and blinds, and the \ninability to monitor the IV tubing or catheter site visually because of the sheet covering the \ninmate.  Trial Tr. 75-82.  None of these issues is addressed or mentioned in the protocol; thus, it \nis reasonable to conclude that Defendants are planning to maintain these aspects of the \n                                                 \n8 The protocol states that a “sufficient quantity” of saline will be injected to confirm that the IV \nlines have been properly inserted before the injection process begins.  While this technique, \nalong with effective monitoring of the catheter site, can confirm that the catheter is properly \ninserted at that point in the procedure, this technique by itself will not reveal whether the catheter \nhas become dislodged or has infiltrated at a subsequent point, after the drugs have begun to be \nadministered.  Trial Tr. 78-79; Heath Decl. ¶ 31. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 13 of 20(cid:10)\n \nprocedure.  In addition, the proposed protocol does not provide a means of certifying anesthetic \ndepth, which would help prevent miscommunications among the execution team.  See Heath \nDecl. ¶ 42.  Individually and combined, these problems create a risk that the inmate will not \nreceive the full dose of thiopental and the execution team will not be able to detect the problem. \n  Along similar lines, the proposed protocol and Defendants’ memorandum are \nconspicuously silent on the question of whether John Doe I will continue to participate in \nexecutions.  The proposed protocol is, as discussed above, vague on a number of crucial medical \nissues, apparently conferring unbridled discretion on the medical personnel.  If John Doe I \ncontinues to supervise executions, therefore, he will be entrusted with same degree of discretion \nthat he has enjoyed in the past.  See Order at 11-12.  Plaintiff proffered extensive testimony at \ntrial regarding John Doe I’s questionable medical judgment and the dangers created by his \ncontrol over the procedure, and this Court expressed serious concerns regarding his participation.  \nTrial Tr. 20-66; 152-68; Order at 8-12.  Defendants’ apparent reservation of their right to retain \nJohn Doe I is therefore completely unacceptable.   \nE.  Contingency Plan.  \n \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Order. \n \n  This Court also required the State’s protocol to contain a contingency plan in case \nproblems develop during the execution procedure.  Order at 15.  The State has complied only in \npart, providing for a second IV line through which an additional 5 grams of thiopental will be \nadministered if the initial 5 grams do not render the prisoner unconscious.  See Defs. Mem. at 3.  \nThis Court, however, found that the State’s lethal injection procedure created an unnecessary risk \nof pain, see Order at 13, so the State’s contingency plan should be designed to address the \ncontingencies that create a likelihood of pain.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 14 of 20(cid:10)\n \n  The State did not do that.  For instance, it has provided no contingency plan for treating \ncomplications arising out of IV access, including the numerous serious and painful complications \nof central line access.  Rather, the State apparently contemplates leaving the treatment of such \ncomplications – and the placement of an alternative IV line in the event that the first results in \nsome complication – to inexperienced or untrained personnel.  These personnel, however, need a \ncontingency plan to guide them because they cannot rely on their experience in these situations.     \n  The State has also offered no contingency plan for problems arising during the mixing of \nthe drugs.  Mixing problems have plagued previous executions, and a failure to prepare a proper \ndose of thiopental indisputably creates a likelihood of pain.  Nonetheless, the State has not \nconsidered its course of action if confronted with foreseeable mixing failures, such as inability to \ndissolve the thiopental.  See Heath Decl. ¶¶ 38.  The State’s failure to offer a contingency plan \nregarding the mixing not only fails to comply with the Court’s Order but is appalling in light of \nthe numerous mixing problems that have already come to light in this case.   \n  2.  The State’s Proposal Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Pain.   \n \n  The State’s failure to plan for contingencies creates an unnecessary risk of pain, because \nit forces personnel to confront difficulties that arise with ad hoc improvisation, rather than \ninformed, careful decision making.9 \nF.  Auditing Process.  \n \n  1.  The State’s Proposed Protocol Does Not Comply with the Order. \n \n  The Court required the State to put in place an auditing process to ensure that the \nindividuals carrying out the execution procedure are correctly following the protocol.  See Order \n                                                 \n9 The above examples of contingencies not accounted for in the proposed protocol are not meant \nto be an exclusive list.  It is the State’s duty to gain the expertise necessary to anticipate the range \nof foreseeable contingencies and adequately provide for them. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 15 of 20(cid:10)\n \nat 15.  The State’s proposal does not ensure that the execution team will correctly follow the \nprotocol.  The State only offers ex post measures that require the execution team, after the \nprocedure, to verify they have taken certain steps; it does nothing to ensure that the personnel \nwill properly follow the protocol during an execution.  Effective auditing requires a rigorous, on-\nthe-scene system of checks and balances.  See Heath Decl. ¶ 39.  Only with contemporaneous \noversight can the State be sure that execution personnel be constrained to perform their tasks \nproperly and safely.  Otherwise, a single individual can subvert the entire process and cause an \ninhumane execution, whether through error or malice.  Indeed, experience in this case should \ndemonstrate that ex post documentation of aspects of the procedure provide no constraint or \nassurance as to the performance of the execution.  The “Chemical Log” referenced in the State’s \nprotocol has been used in previous executions, but was insufficient to ensure that the execution \nteam prepared and injected the correct dose of thiopental, or even provide the State with any \nknowledge of what doses were prepared.  See Doe I Depo. Tr. at 9-10, 14, 24-25.  Disturbingly, \ndespite this previous experience, the State has offered no procedural change that would render \nthese ex post logs sufficient to guard against departures from the stated protocol.10       \n  Additionally, the proposed protocol may retain John Doe I as part of the execution team.  \nGiven his track record of error and misrepresentations, and the extreme extent to which the \nexecution team deferred to him, it is doubtful whether any execution procedure that includes \nJohn Doe I, without oversight by a doctor to whom he would report and defer, could provide \nmeaningful, contemporaneous checks and balances that ensure that the procedure goes as \nplanned and as stated.  Certainly, the State has provided no basis for such confidence. \n                                                 \n10 Indeed, while deviations from the protocol are to be reported to the Director of Department of \nCorrections, see Defs. Mem. at 4, the proposal does not even indicate that such deviations would \nlead to changes in the procedure or disciplinary measures against those individuals responsible \nfor the departure. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 16 of 20(cid:10)\n \n  2.  The State’s Proposal Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Pain.   \n \n  The State’s failure to put in place sufficient auditing processes creates an unnecessary \nrisk of pain, because it fails to provide sufficient guarantees that the execution procedure will be \nfollowed as planned.   \nG.  Changes to the Lethal Injection Procedure. \n  Finally, this Court ordered that after its approval, “no further changes shall be made to \nthe lethal injection protocol without seeking the prior approval of this Court.”  Order at 15.  The \nproposed protocol, however, operates at such a broad level of generality that the State could \nmake any number of changes in its actual practices without altering the language of the protocol.  \nAs noted above, in several instances, the State makes vague assertions about how it will carry out \nthe executions -- with “sufficient” lighting, “appropriate” catheter sites, etc. -- but provides little \nor no detail as to the particulars.  Because the State offers so little detail, it leaves itself enough \nleeway to make changes within the scope of its proposed protocol without having to seek \napproval from this Court.  In other words, were this Court to approve the instant proposal, the \nState would have free rein to make significant changes without judicial oversight.   \n        *  *  *  *  * \n  The State’s proposal does not comply with this Court’s Order, and the alternatives it \nproposes are inadequate and give rise to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain and \nsuffering.  The proposal is also exceedingly vague on many points.  This vagueness makes it \nimpossible to determine what the State is planning to do.  It also results in inadequate \ninstructions on how to perform complicated tasks, a failing that is particularly troublesome in \nlight of Missouri’s failure to identify qualified personnel.  The purpose of having a written \nprotocol is to provide step-by-step instructions that are binding on execution team members in \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 17 of 20(cid:10)\n \norder to ensure that executions are “carried out consistently,” with no ad hoc improvisations “at a \nmoment’s notice.”  Order at 11.  This would serve to protect the inmate and the State from the \ndeviations and poor judgment that have marred executions in the past.   \nCreating a safe execution protocol that does not risk unnecessary pain requires careful \nanalysis of each element of the procedure individually and in coordination with the others.  Quite \nsimply, the State has not invested the thoughtful consideration necessary to create a safe, humane \nprocedure.   \nII.  THIS COURT SHOULD REJECT THE STATE’S CHALLENGE TO ITS \n  REQUIREMENT THAT AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST PARTICIPATE IN THE \n  LETHAL INJECTION PROCEDURE. \n \n  The Order required that a board-certified anesthesiologist take part in the State’s lethal \ninjection procedure.  The State admits that it has been “unable to comply with the Court’s \ndirection” in this regard.  Defs. Mem at 4.  The State’s proposal, thus, is in essence a motion for \nreconsideration, contending that this Court erred in requiring an anesthesiologist.  Id. at 6.  There \nis no legitimate basis for reconsideration here. \n  The thrust of the State’s argument is that because it has so far been unable to identify a \nboard-certified anesthesiologist willing to participate in its execution procedure, it should be \nexcused from that requirement.  As an initial matter, though, the State plainly has not exhausted \nall avenues for compliance with the Order.  It has sent form letters to 298 board-certified \nanesthesiologists – out of the over 39,000 in the country – and has not yet found a willing \nparticipant.  See Moore Aff. ¶¶ 2-3; http://www.asahq.org/aboutAsa/membership.htm.  The State \ndoes not explain why it has apparently not considered other means of recruiting an \nanesthesiologist, such as employing medical recruiters.  Indeed, the State’s insistence that it will \nbe impossible for it to comply rings especially hollow in light of a survey indicating that 19% of \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 18 of 20(cid:10)\n \nall doctors indicated willingness to personally take part in lethal injection procedures.  See \nPhysicians’ Willingness To Participate in the Process of Lethal Injection for Capital \nPunishment, Ann. Intern. Med. 2001 Nov. 20, Exh. 5 to Heath Decl.; Heath Decl. ¶¶ 43-45.   \n  Even more to the point -- and contrary to the State’s contention -- this Court’s \nrequirement of an anesthesiologist does not bar implementation of the death penalty in Missouri.  \nSee Defs. Mem. at 6.  There are methods of execution that do not require an anesthesiologist.  \nIndeed, the State itself identifies one of those methods, when it notes that the Morales court \noffered the option of execution by a properly administered massive dose of a barbiturate \n“without any direction that a doctor be present.”  Id. at 7 (citing Morales v. Hickman, 415 F. \nSupp. 2d 1037, 1047 (N.D. Cal. 2006)).  Plaintiff himself has also suggested this method.   See \nPlaintiff’s Pretrial Br. at 10.  The State is thus flatly mistaken when it claims the Order imposes \nan insurmountable bar to carrying out the death penalty.11  Instead, this Court merely required \nwhat was evident at trial:  that if the State chooses to inject potassium chloride, then it must use a \nboard certified anesthesiologist.  Nothing, however, requires the State to continue to use the \nproblematic three-chemical sequence it has selected. \n        *  *  *  *  * \n  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should reject the State’s proposed protocol.   \n                                                 \n11 In arguing that this Court committed “legal error” in requiring an anesthesiologist, the State \nmisconceives the nature of the Court’s decision.  The Court found that the execution procedure \nviolated the Eighth Amendment because it exposed prisoners to an unnecessary risk of pain.  \nOrder at 13.  The Court then fashioned a remedy, including the use of an anesthesiologist, that it \nfound was “necessary to ensure that lethal injections are carried out humanely.”  Id.  The cases \ncited by the State are thus inapposite, as those decisions all found that the execution procedures \nat issue did not present an unnecessary risk of pain.  Because no Eighth Amendment violation \nwas found in those states, the courts in those cases issued no remedy and, accordingly, declined \nto order the participation of an anesthesiologist.  See Bieghler v. State, 839 N.E. 691, 696 (Ind. \n2005) (no showing of an “unacceptable risk of . . . wanton infliction of pain”); Evans v. Saar, \n412 F. Supp. 519, 524 (D. Md. 2004) (no “substantial and unnecessary risks intrinsic to the \nprocedure”).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 202-1     Filed 07/24/2006     Page 19 of 20(cid:10)\n \n   \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ JOHN WILLIAM SIMON           /s/ DONALD B.

MARK HEATH \n \n1.  Counsel for Mr. Taylor have asked me to comment on the proposed execution protocol \nsubmitted by the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) on July 14, 2006.  I read the judge’s \ndecision of June 26, 2006, and then I reviewed the DOC’s new protocol.  I think that the judge \nproposed an effective means of addressing the concerns about the practice of lethal injection in \nMissouri, but I do not believe that the DOC has listened to what the judge said or proposed an \nalternative remedy that is as good as what the judge proposed.  \n2.  At the risk of repeating myself, it appears to me that the DOC in the past has not \nperformed executions with the gravity, seriousness and care that ought to be observed.  I do not \nsee any attempt to make a clear break with their past systems and process in this proposed \nprotocol.  Instead, it appears to me that the DOC intends to keep as much of its previous \nprocedure in place as is possible.  Indeed, John Doe I may still run the execution process.  The \nprotocol as written also creates a significant and needless risk that the inmate will not be properly \nanesthetized prior to the administration of pancuronium and potassium. \nI.  The Requirement of a Board-Certified Anesthesiologist \n3.  The Court’s Order of July 26, 2006 required that a board-certified anesthesiologist \nparticipate in executions by preparing and mixing the chemicals, determining the appropriate \nmeans of IV access, supervising or administering the injection, and verifying and certifying that, \nin the anesthesiologist’s medical judgment, the inmate is sufficiently anesthetized prior to the \nadministration of pancuronium and potassium.   \n4.  I believe that a protocol containing these safeguards, and requiring that they be properly \nexecuted by a competent board-certified anesthesiologist with the ability and intent to physically \nexamine the inmate, would reasonably minimize the risk that an inmate would be aware during \nthe administration of the pancuronium and potassium.  So long as potassium is used to cause \n \n\n \ndeath, it is necessary to induce general anesthesia before injecting the potassium.  A board-\ncertified anesthesiologist has the advanced training necessary to allow him or her, using proper \ntechniques, to ensure that general anesthesia has been successfully induced.   \n5.  The court’s requirement of a board-certified anesthesiologist to monitor anesthetic depth \nsatisfies the standard of care that anesthesiologists and veterinarians agree is absolutely \nnecessary when potassium is used to cause death.   Dr. Orin Guidry, the president of the \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists, recently published his observations regarding \nanesthesiologist participation in lethal injection, stating: “If the courts demand that inmates be \nsufficiently anesthetized, then I would have to agree with the court that the only way to assure \nthat would be to have an anesthesiologist prepare and administer the drugs, carefully observe the \ninmate and all pertinent monitors, and finally to integrate all this information. I don’t think that \nany of us would want to say that untrained individuals under current death chamber conditions \ncan reliably produce a satisfactory level of unconsciousness.”  (Dr. Guidry’s letter is attached as \nExhibit 1.) \n6.  The 2000 Report of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation reaches the same conclusion.  In discussing euthanizing animals using potassium \nchloride, the Report states: “It is of utmost importance that personnel performing this technique \nare trained and knowledgeable in anesthetic techniques, and are competent in assessing \nanesthetic depth appropriate for administration of potassium chloride intravenously. \nAdministration of potassium chloride intravenously requires animals to be in a surgical plane of \nanesthesia characterized by loss of consciousness, loss of reflex muscle response, and loss of \nresponse to noxious stimuli.” (Page 681, attached as Exhibit 2.) \n7.  I feel that it is necessary to note here that whenever one hires a doctor, one must take \nprecautions to make sure that the doctor, in addition to being trained and board-certified, is also \ncompetent and will perform his or her duties in good faith.  For instance, if the DOC were to hire \nan anesthesiologist who has been barred from practice, for example for incompetence or \ncommission of a felony, or states that he believes inmates should be subject to excruciating pain, \nthen I would be concerned that that doctor’s participation in the execution procedure would \ncreate a significant risk that the inmate would suffer during the procedure.  As the DOC has not \nyet found an anesthesiologist, however, this concern is purely theoretical at this point.  \n8.  In sum, while no complex endeavor can be completely risk-free, I believe that the Court’s \nrequirement that a board-certified anesthesiologist monitor anesthetic depth prior to the \nadministration of pancuronium and potassium will properly safeguard the inmate’s and State’s \ninterest in a humane execution.  By contrast, the DOC’s proposed protocol does not provide \nthese safeguards.  Further, it appears that the DOC does not understand the need for these \nsafeguards even after being informed about them during the hearings. \nII.  The Execution Protocol Submitted by the DOC \n9.  The execution protocol submitted by the DOC on July 14, 2006, fails to ensure that \nexecutions in Missouri are performed humanely.  The DOC has chosen to execute prisoners by \nmeans of potassium, which everyone agrees requires the induction and maintenance of general \nanesthesia until the time of death.  While the DOC’s attempt to provide some form of monitoring \n2 \n \n\n \nof anesthetic depth is a positive step, the monitoring contemplated is not meaningful, especially \nin light of the fact that the monitoring will not be performed by a board-certified \nanesthesiologist.  Overall, the protocol is deficient in a number of respects, including its reliance \non inadequately trained personnel, failure to provide meaningful monitoring of anesthetic depth, \nfailure to provide specific instructions on a number of issues, and failure to anticipate a number \nof foreseeable contingencies.   \n  A.  Inadequately Trained Personnel \n10.  The execution protocol provides that “a physician, nurse, or emergency medical \ntechnician” will insert the IV lines, monitor the prisoner’s anesthetic depth, and supervise the \ninjection.  \n11.  Physicians, nurses, and EMTs generally do not have any training in inducing general \nanesthesia.  It is my understanding, based on my review of the protocol, that the DOC does not \nintend to require that the particular physician, nurse, or EMT who participates in executions have \nany training or background in the induction of general anesthesia.   \n12.  As I testified at trial, inducing general anesthesia, and verifying that a patient has reached \na surgical plane of anesthesia, is a complex task that requires the integration of multiple \nmodalities of information.  To perform this task reliably and properly, a person must have \nextensive training in the medical subspecialty of Anesthesiology.  It is also necessary to have \ncurrent and practical experience in monitoring patients’ anesthetic depth (such as an \nanesthesiologist would gain during his or her training and residency) in order to be able to \nreliably discern when a patient has been insufficiently anesthetized.  Doctors who are not \nanesthesiologists, nurses, and EMTs do not, except in rare cases, have this advanced training or \nexperience.   \n13.  Using personnel untrained in anesthesiology to induce general anesthesia and monitor \nanesthetic depth is not consistent with the standard of care in Missouri or elsewhere.  In the \nmedical context, only a fully trained anesthesiologist should supervise or perform the induction \nand maintenance of general anesthesia in a surgical setting; other doctors, nurses, and EMTs \nwould not be credentialed (i.e., permitted by the hospital) to do so.   \n14.  Not only does the protocol contemplate using medical personnel who have no \nbackground or training in anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these personnel would receive any \ninstruction in how to perform the monitoring techniques required by the protocol (testing for \nphysical movement, eyelash reflex, etc.).  The protocol is noticeably silent regarding whether \nthis type of instruction will take place, and if so, who will provide the instruction.  Thus, the \npersonnel asked to perform the monitoring may have absolutely no understanding of what they \nare supposed to do or what observations they need to make.  A “crash course” on using specific \nmethods of testing anesthetic depth would not substitute for the years of extensive training and \npractice that inform an anesthesiologist’s exercise of medical judgment. \n  B.    Inadequate Monitoring of Anesthetic Depth \n15.  The monitoring provided by the DOC’s protocol is not an adequate substitute for using a \nboard-certified anesthesiologist to ascertain and monitor anesthetic depth.  In this respect, the \n3 \n \n\n \nprotocol fails to provide any reasonable assurance that inmates will be properly anesthetized \nprior to the administration of the pancuronium and potassium. \n16.  There are many useful tests, techniques, and monitors that anesthesiologists use in their \nassessment of anesthetic depth.  It is important to understand that the ability to effectively and \naccurately use these techniques can only be developed through extensive clinical training in the \nfield of anesthesiology.  I note that while a board-certified anesthesiologist would be able to use \nhis or her medical judgment to determine what techniques to use to monitor anesthetic depth, the \nDOC has had to specify what techniques will be used because it seeks to use personnel who have \nno background in anesthesiology that they can bring to bear on the situation.  This is why the \njudge’s order makes logical sense: rather than prescribing what tests should be used, he specified \nthat an anesthesiologist should determine what to do using his or her training and judgment. \n17.  This point is underscored by the litigation preceding the Brown execution in North \nCarolina, in which the state proposed to substitute a BIS monitor for a professional assessment of \nanesthetic depth.  Virtually everyone, including the medical director of the manufacturer of the \nBIS monitor and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), agreed that the BIS monitor \ncannot substitute for an anesthesiologist who, relying on multiple streams of information and \ntheir extensive training and experience, carefully synthesizes information to assess anesthetic \ndepth.   Only Dr. Dershwitz seemed to believe otherwise.  The ASA’s Practice Advisory for \nIntraoperative Awareness and Brain Function Monitoring is attached as Exhibit 3 (see pages 14-\n15, 21-22 for a discussion of the BIS monitor).   \n18.  The protocol provides that the physician, nurse, or EMT will monitor anesthetic depth \nusing “standard clinical techniques, such as checking for movement, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, \npupillary responses or diameters, and response to verbal commands and physical stimuli.”  This \nlanguage is lifted from the ASA Practice Advisory on Intraoperative Awareness.  (See Exhibit 3, \nPart III.A.)  This is particularly troubling because this document is intended for use by \nindividuals who are trained and proficient in the administration and maintenance of general \nanesthesia.  See Exhibit 3, Part D, p.4.  It is not intended as a substitute for training and \nexperience in anesthesiology, nor is it possible for any document or any set of documents or \nbooks to substitute for such training.  The assessment of anesthetic depth, like driving or flying, \nis something that can only be learned from experience and practice.   One cannot just “do a test”; \none has to know which tests to perform, how to perform them, how to interpret them, and how to \nintegrate the results with other streams of real-time data to form an impression or conclusion \nabout anesthetic depth.  Learning how to assess anesthetic depth requires formal anesthesia \ntraining from individuals who are themselves proficient in the assessment of anesthetic depth.  \nThe training necessarily includes extensive clinical experience in which anesthetic depth is \nassessed over and over again on many patients until one develops the intuitive capacity for doing \nit accurately and properly.     \n19.  Not surprisingly, the DOC has misinterpreted the ASA guidelines.  In addition to listing \nsome of the “clinical techniques used to assess intraoperative consciousness,” the ASA advisory \nmentions “conventional monitoring systems” that include “ASA standard monitoring.”  The \naudience for whom the Practice Advisory was written understands that “standards for basic \nanesthetic monitoring” include the measurement of blood pressure.  See ASA Standards for \nBasic Anesthetic Monitoring, attached as Exhibit 4.  No anesthesiologist would plan to monitor \n4 \n \n\n \nanesthetic depth (as is necessary during the execution until the prisoner is dead) without \nmeasuring the blood pressure.  The DOC’s proposed protocol does not list this, because the DOC \ndoes not understand what is involved in assessing anesthetic depth, and it believes that assessing \nanesthetic depth is a simple matter that can be conveyed in a few short sentences. \n20.  Obviously the DOC is now, on the basis of the above criticism, going to revise the \nprotocol by adding the measurement of blood pressure to their laundry list of tests.  But this does \nnot address the overarching problem, which is that the DOC believes that it can, without the on-\nsite “in-the-room” supervision of an anesthesiologist, reliably and meaningfully assess (and if \nneeded deepen) anesthetic depth.  The very fact that it would propose that these tests be done by \npersonnel untrained in anesthesiology shows that they do not understand what is at stake here. \n21.  For these reasons, the set of tests listed in the protocol is incomplete and inadequate.  In \nmy opinion, an anesthesiologist participating in an execution and exercising his or her medical \njudgment regarding how to verify and monitor anesthetic depth, given the execution set-up and \nthe chemicals used, would not be satisfied or willing to proceed if they were restricted to this set \nof tests.   \n22.  Any monitoring of anesthetic depth must test whether the inmate has reached a surgical \nplane of anesthesia.  Some of the techniques listed in the proposed protocol are useful only for \ntesting whether the inmate has reached a relatively shallow plane of anesthesia (an inmate might \nnot respond correctly to verbal commands, and thus appear unconscious according to this \ntechnique, yet still be sufficiently aware to suffer when the potassium is injected).  It is simply \nimpossible to use personnel untrained in anesthesia to perform some or all of the listed tests, \nwithout any understanding of what information each technique can provide and how each fits in \nto the broad suite of assessment techniques, and gain any assurance that the inmate is in fact \nsufficiently anesthetized. \n23.  Moreover, the tests, taken together, are not sufficient to guarantee that the inmate remains \nsufficiently anesthetized until death.  Once the pancuronium paralyzes the inmate, any \nassessment of anesthetic depth -- which remains necessary because the inmate could regain \nconsciousness before the potassium is injected -- must take into account the fact that the inmate \ncould not respond to stimuli or indicate distress even if he were fully conscious.  Verifying the \nanesthetic depth of an individual paralyzed by pancuronium requires the assessment of extremely \nsubtle indicators of consciousness that do not rely on the activity of facial muscles or any other \nmotor responses.  The DOC has not attempted to provide techniques for post-pancuronium \nmonitoring, and obviously untrained personnel do not have any of the experience necessary to \nperform this type of monitoring. \n  C.  Inadequate Provisions for Obtaining IV Access \n24.  As I testified during the hearing, successfully and humanely achieving IV access is a \ncrucial element of a humane execution protocol.  The provisions regarding IV access set forth in \nthe DOC’s new protocol do not, in my opinion, adequately ensure that the process of inserting \nthe IV will be humane, or that the IVs placed will be sufficiently reliable to ensure successful \ndelivery of the chemicals. \n5 \n \n\n \n25.  The Court’s order contemplates that the anesthesiologist will have the authority to \ndetermine “the most appropriate location on the inmate’s body to inject the drugs.”  I believe that \nthe judge envisions that a board-certified anesthesiologist will exercise his or her medical \njudgment to determine what catheter location is medically indicated (and therefore \n“appropriate”), rather than choosing the catheter site based on non-medical considerations.  I was \nconcerned that John Doe I stated that he chose to use central lines in part based on the warden’s \ndesire to have a rapid execution, rather than on sound medical considerations.  As a result of this, \nhe ended up obtaining IV access in a manner that is not used as the first choice in any other \nsetting, medical or execution, because it is much more invasive, painful, and risky.   The judge’s \norder is therefore a major improvement over the past practice of automatically placing a central \nline.   \n26.  The protocol submitted by the DOC simply states that “medical personnel determine the \nmost appropriate locations for” the IV lines.  This vague language raises several concerns.  It is \nnot clear whether the most appropriate location will be chosen based on medical considerations, \nor on non-medical factors, such as penological and aesthetic concerns.  For instance, John Doe I \nindicated that he used femoral catheterization, even though it was not medically indicated, in \norder to ensure that the injections could be performed very quickly.   \n27.  The protocol also does not specify which medical personnel will be given authority to \ndecide where to place the catheter.  If John Doe I continues to participate in the execution \nprocess, I am extremely concerned that he will continue to insert central lines as a matter of \ncourse, because, as I testified during the hearing, his medical judgment during executions was in \nmy opinion, rather poor.  Moreover, nurses and EMTs do not determine whether to place central \nlines except in emergent circumstances and, depending on the individual nurse or EMT, may not \nbe competent to make such a decision. \n28.  If sound medical judgment has determined that a central line is needed, it is also \nappropriate for a properly trained person to determine which kind of central line to use.  Each \ntype of central line (jugular, subclavian, femoral) has its own risks, its own benefits, and its own \nset of known complications.  All types of central lines can lead to catastrophic bleeding.  Placing \na jugular line risks puncturing or lacerating the carotid artery, a not-infrequent complication, \nwhich could lead to a hematoma that obstructs the airway and causes death by asphyxiation if \nuntreated.  A massive stroke and paralysis could result from decreased blood flow in the carotid \nartery.  Placing a subclavian line can also cause a pneumothorax, which is a collection of air \ninside the chest but outside the lungs.  This can cause an agonizing death by asphyxiation and \ncardiovascular collapse.  All of these complications are more likely to occur, and less likely to be \nadequately treated, if the catheterization is performed by personnel who are inadequately trained \nor inexperienced.   \n29.  Nor does the protocol state whether the execution team will ensure that it has the \nequipment that is necessary to place central lines and deal with the potential complications of \ncentral lines.  It is very important that any personnel placing a central line have the equipment \nnecessary to react to the foreseeable complications that are known to arise, many of which are \nboth excruciatingly painful and agonizing.  Subclavian lines, for instance, require a bed that can \ntilt (lowering the head relative to the feet distends the subclavian vein so that the needle and \ncatheter can enter the lumen) and the ability to place a chest tube should a pneumothorax occur.  \n6 \n \n\n \nPersonnel placing jugular lines must be prepared, among other things, to intubate the inmate if \nthe airway is obstructed, and must have chest tube capability.  In fact, John Doe I agreed that \nadditional equipment was necessary for subclavian lines, and that the execution team was not \nequipped to place them (although this knowledge did not deter him from using a subclavian line \nat least once).  \n30.  The protocol also does not specify when the determination as to where to place the \ncatheter is made.  If an inmate were examined days or weeks before the execution date, as is the \npractice in several other states, the determination could be made at that point, and the execution \nteam could be prepared in advance if, for instance, it were decided that only a subclavian line \nwould provide reliable venous access.  In contrast, if the determination is made on the night of \nthe execution, the decision to do a central line could necessitate ad hoc improvisation, \nparticularly if the team does not have the equipment necessary to ensure that the procedure is \nperformed safely.   \n31.  The protocol also does not contain adequate provisions for ensuring the patency of the IV \nlines.  As was the case before the Court’s order, the DOC intends to inject saline solution into the \nIV lines just after they are inserted to make sure that they have been inserted properly.  There is \nno plan to monitor the patency of the IV lines during the injection process, however.  It is \nstandard medical practice to use an IV bag dripping saline or another solution in conjunction \nwith the IV tubing used to deliver intravenous drugs because doing so enables medical personnel \nto ensure that fluids are properly flowing through the IV tubing.  To my knowledge, this peculiar \npractice is not used in any other state.  The use of the line without a drip was implemented by \nJohn Doe I, and so I am worried that the DOC’s failure to use an IV bag in the new protocol \nindicates that John Doe I is still basically in charge of the procedure. \n32.  The judge commented in his order that the DOC needs to institute contingency plans to \nprovide for foreseeable problems (such as leaking, infiltration, etc.).  I completely agree with \nthis.  As the above discussion indicates, the DOC has not thought through a number of \ncontingencies that could arise with respect to IV access, including the need to place a central line \nand failure of one IV line during the injection process.  Not to belabor the point, but if a person \ntrained in anesthesia were involved, it would be much less necessary to “game out” all of the \ncontingencies, because that is an inherent and core feature of anesthesiology training.  \n  D.  Other Inadequacies in the Protocol  \n33.  I have discussed above what I see as the major problems with the DOC’s failure to be \nresponsive to the judge’s suggestions.  In addition to these problems, there are a number of other \nunsatisfactory elements of the proposed protocol.  The DOC has failed to provide specific \ninstructions with regard to a number of additional issues.  This may indicate that the DOC has \nfailed to think through a number of aspects of the execution process, or it may reflect an \nassumption that execution personnel will improvise or use their discretion in a number of areas, \nmuch like what has occurred at previous executions.  Either possibility is very concerning. \n34.  The lack of specific instructions is problematic for a number of reasons.  Allowing \nunchecked discretion to any inadequately qualified individual or group of individuals can lead to \nerrors in judgment and unjustifiable deviations from stated procedures, resulting in increased risk \n7 \n \n\n \nto the inmate.  John Doe I’s questionable decisions with regard to aspects of the execution \nprocess demonstrate this point.  In addition, when untrained or unqualified personnel are given \nroles in the execution procedure -- though I repeat that they should never be used to assess \nanesthetic depth in an execution -- increased detail and instructions are necessary to ensure that \nthey can simply follow the steps provided without being forced to exercise their discretion.   \n35.  Following are examples of areas in which the protocol is vague or incomplete. \n36.  Mixing the Thiopental.  The protocol does not provide any instructions as to how the \nthiopental will be mixed.  Most nurses and EMTs have little to no experience mixing anesthetic \ndrugs, and would therefore need detailed instructions to guide them.  The instructions provided \nin the package insert are insufficient in the execution context.  Thiopental is generally packaged \nin 500-mg kits, and the kits are designed so that a medical professional can mix a single clinical \ndose of thiopental using the materials in the kit.  The proposed protocol requires deviating from \nthe instructions in the package insert, which addresses only the preparation of a standard \nindividual dose of 500 mg or less, but does not give concrete mechanical instructions for doing \nso.   \n37.  Such instructions would protect the inmate from the possibility of ad hoc deviations like \nthose resorted to by John Doe I.  He testified that he had created a mixing procedure because the \nthiopental kits procured by the DOC contained ready-made syringes that already contained the \nthiopental powder, and were not designed for creating a single overdose of thiopental.  This \nscenario could easily arise again, and the need for untrained personnel to improvise a mixing \nprocess could lead to confusion, mistakes, and inability to prepare the full dose of anesthetic.  \nJohn Doe I’s mixing procedure, for instance, did not allow him to prepare the full five-gram dose \nof thiopental.  This is a foreseeable situation and the protocol ought to address it.   \n38.  Nor does the protocol provide any course of action if the execution team is unable to \ndissolve the thiopental in the diluent.  Obviously, this contingency is foreseeable because, based \non the testimony, it appears to have occurred in the past.  Although the DOC states that the \nexplanation for that problem was the high concentration used by John Doe I, I testified that there \nare other causes of insolubility, including that the thiopental was defective.  The DOC has no \nway of knowing which explanation is correct, given its failure to collect toxicology data from \nexecuted inmates, without testing the thiopental.  The DOC should not simply hope and assume \nthat this problem will not recur.   \n39.  Auditing Process.  The judge’s order discusses an auditing process to correct the previous \nfailure to institute any checks and balances before, during, or after the execution.  I think this is \nan important step because I believe that people will be more motivated to perform executions in \na considered, thoughtful, and humane manner if they know that they are being observed.  \nAlthough the protocol provides that DOC officials will sign off on the chemical log after each \nexecution, there are no on-the-scene checks and balances that can prevent mistakes from \noccurring during an execution.  As I testified at trial, a system of “checks and balances” is \ncritical to ensuring that no one person, whether through inadvertent error or bad faith, can thwart \nefforts to perform executions humanely. \n8 \n \n\n \n40.  In addition, the protocol states that the medical personnel will complete a “Chemical \nLog” indicating the quantities of chemicals used and discarded during the execution.  As John \nDoe I testified, however, the document currently used by the DOC as a “Chemical Log” is not \ndesigned to allow personnel to record the quantities of chemicals discarded or actually used.  Is \nthe DOC going to prepare a new chemical log form?  Or are they simply going to continue using \nthe old one?  Again, it appears that the DOC simply has not thoroughly considered the need for a \nmeans of accurately recording the amounts of chemicals used. \n41.  Lighting.  The Court’s order specified that the execution support room should be \nsufficiently lighted to allow the execution team to see clearly while they perform their tasks.  \nCorrections officials stated that the level of lighting in the execution support room was designed \nto protect their legitimate interest in obscuring the identities of the execution team, and the \ninterest in ensuring a humane execution by using sufficient lighting is somewhat in tension with \nthe team’s security interest.  The new protocol states only that the lighting in the execution \nsupport room will be “sufficient” to “permit proper administration of the chemicals.”  It is \ntherefore unclear to me whether and how the DOC plans to resolve the tension described above, \nand whether the DOC intends to increase the lighting in the support room.  I think that the level \nof lighting should be set by an anesthesiologist, who, based on their clinical experience and \npractice, knows the level of illumination that is necessary for them to do their job. \n42.  In his decision, the judge indicated that the new protocol should “specify . . . how the \nanesthesiologist will certify that the inmate has achieved the appropriate anesthetic depth.”  I \nthink this is a good suggestion, but the DOC appears not to be interested in following it.  No \nprovision is made for communicating to the executioners the medical personnel’s conclusion as \nto whether the inmate is anesthetized.  Failing to instruct team members as to how to \ncommunicate vital information to each other, and to institute procedures for ensuring that \ninformation is communicated accurately, increases the risk of miscues and errors.  \nIII.  The DOC’s Failure to Recruit an Anesthesiologist \n43.  Another issue that warrants discussion is the DOC’s approach to recruiting an \nanesthesiologist to participate in executions.  My understanding of the judge’s order was that the \nstate was required to design a procedure incorporating an anesthesiologist by July 15, but was \nnot required to find an anesthesiologist in this time period.  Recruiting is necessarily a somewhat \ntime-consuming process, and clearly the ethical dimensions of participation in executions will \nsomewhat narrow the field of candidates.  I would not expect that the State would be able to find \nan anesthesiologist within the three weeks between the order and the July 15 deadline.  Rather, I \nthought the point of the judge’s order was that the State would specify in the protocol that there \nwould be a central role for an anesthesiologist, but that the DOC would not need to identify who \nwould fill that role until an execution approached.  \n44.  Despite the ethical issues that surround this, the reality is that there are many physicians, \nincluding anesthesiologists, who, at a personal level, are comfortable with participation in \nexecutions.  This opinion is backed up by published literature.  In an article entitled “Physicians’ \nattitudes about involvement in lethal injection for capital punishment,” attached hereto as Exhibit \n4, Neil Farber and colleagues surveyed physicians in 2000 and found that 34% approved of eight \nactions related to the conduct of lethal injection, including actually injecting the drugs.  (Arch. \n9 \n \n\n \nIntern. Med. 2000 Oct. 23; 160(19):2912-6).  In a related study, Farber and colleagues found that \n25% of physicians would personally perform five or more actions intrinsic to the conduct of \nlethal injection.  (“Physicians’ willingness to participate in the process of lethal injection for \ncapital punishment,” Ann. Intern. Med. 2001 Nov. 20; 135(10):884-8, attached hereto as Exhibit \n5.)  Nineteen percent of responding physicians stated that they would personally administer the \nlethal drugs.  While the survey did not specifically target anesthesiologists, I have no reason to \nbelieve that the attitude of anesthesiologists would depart markedly from the attitudes of \nphysicians in general. \n45.   The survey data strongly suggest that, of the several tens of thousands of \nanesthesiologists in the United States, some significant minority would be willing to participate \nin executions in the manner envisioned by the court’s order.  Thus, it appears to me that the DOC \nhas not meaningfully explored the possibility of recruiting an anesthesiologist.  While I am not \ninvolved in the recruiting side of the medical profession, I do believe that simply sending out 298 \nletters of the type sent by the DOC would foreseeably fail to attract candidates. \nIV.  Conclusion \n46.  I am concerned that the DOC believes that its proposed protocol is adequate, and that it \nreasonably ensures that this important procedure is performed in a humane and dignified fashion.  \nIt appears that the DOC did not understand or appreciate the important issues that were being \ndiscussed during the hearing.  Overall, the problem is that the DOC does not understand that if \npancuronium and potassium are used, an anesthesiologist is necessary to assess anesthetic depth.  \nThe procedures proposed by the DOC do not come close to satisfying the standard of care that \nmust be observed whenever a person is subjected to an excruciatingly painful procedure. \n \n     \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the \nforegoing is true and correct. \n \n \n \n \n            __________________________ \n                          Mark Heath, M.D. \n \nDated:  July 24, 2006 \n \n10 \n \n\nPractice Advisory for Intraoperative Awareness and Brain Function Monitoring \n \nA Report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Intraoperative Awareness*\n \nPRACTICE advisories are systematically developed reports that are intended to assist decision-\nmaking in areas of patient care.

This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nfor extended periods of time.5  However, in some circumstances, intraoperative awareness may be \nunavoidable in order to achieve other critically important anesthetic goals. \nThe following terms or concepts discussed in this Advisory include:  consciousness, general \nanesthesia, depth of anesthesia or depth of hypnosis, recall, amnesia, intraoperative awareness, and \nbrain function monitors.  Consistent definitions for these terms are not available in the literature.  For \npurposes of this Advisory, these terms are operationally defined or identified as follows: \n(1) Consciousness:  Consciousness is a state in which a patient is able to process information \nfrom his or her surroundings.  Consciousness is assessed by observing a patient’s purposeful \nresponses to various stimuli.  Identifiers of purposeful responses include organized \nmovements following voice commands or noxious/painful stimuli.†  For example, opening of \nthe eyes is one of several possible identifiers or markers of consciousness.  Purposeful \nresponses may be absent when paralysis is present as a consequence of neurological disease \nor the administration of a neuromuscular blocking drug. \n(2) General anesthesia:  General anesthesia is defined as a drug-induced loss of consciousness \nduring which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation.‡  The ability to maintain \nventilatory function independently is often impaired.  Patients often require assistance in \nmaintaining a patent airway, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of \ndepressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. \nCardiovascular function may be impaired. \n(3) Depth of anesthesia:  Depth of anesthesia or depth of hypnosis refers to a continuum of \nprogressive central nervous system depression and decreased responsiveness to stimulation. \n                                                           \n† Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is NOT considered a purposeful response, as indicated by the “continuum of \ndepth of sedation, definition of general anesthesia, and levels of sedation/analgesia;” American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, 2004. \n‡ American Society of Anesthesiologists: Continuum of depth of sedation, definition of general anesthesia, and levels of \nsedation/analgesia;” ASA Standards, Guidelines and Statements, 2004. \n \n   2\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \n(4) Recall:  For the purpose of this Advisory, recall is the patient’s ability to retrieve stored  \nmemories.  Recall is assessed by a patient’s report of previous events, in particular, events \nthat occurred during general anesthesia.  Explicit memory is assessed by the patient’s ability \nto recall specific events that took place during general anesthesia.  Implicit memory is \nassessed by changes in performance or behavior without the ability to recall specific events \nthat took place during general anesthesia that led to those changes.6  A report of recall may be \nspontaneous or it may only be elicited in a structured interview or questionnaire.  This \nAdvisory does not address implicit memory. \n(5)  Amnesia:  Amnesia is the absence of recall.  Many anesthetic drugs produce amnesia at \nconcentrations well below those necessary for suppression of consciousness.  Anterograde \namnesia is intended when a drug with amnestic properties is administered before induction of \nanesthesia.  Retrograde amnesia is intended when a drug such as a benzodiazepine is \nadministered after an event that may have caused or been associated with intraoperative \nconsciousness in the hope that it will suppress memory formation and “rescue” from recall. \n(6)  Intraoperative awareness:  Intraoperative awareness occurs when a patient becomes conscious  \nduring a procedure performed under general anesthesia and subsequently has recall of these \nevents.  For the purpose of this Advisory, recall is limited to explicit memory, and does not \ninclude the time before general anesthesia is fully induced or the time of emergence from \ngeneral anesthesia, when arousal and return of consciousness are intended.  Dreaming is not \nconsidered intraoperative awareness. \n(7)  Brain function monitors:  Brain function monitors are devices that record or process brain \nelectrical activity and convert these signals mathematically into a continuous measure \ntypically scaled from 0 to 100.  In addition to spontaneous cortical electrical activity \n(electroencephalogram, EEG), these devices may also record and process evoked cortical and \n   3\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nsubcortical activity (auditory evoked potentials, or AEP) as well as electromyographic (EMG) \nactivity from scalp muscles.  For the purpose of this Advisory, only monitors purported to \nmeasure depth of anesthesia or hypnosis will be considered.  Other, non-EEG/AEP/EMG \ndevices are also available, but are not addressed by this Advisory. \nB.  Purposes of the Advisory \n   \nIntraoperative awareness under general anesthesia is an important clinical problem that clearly is \nwithin the foundation of training and continuing medical education in anesthesiology.  The purposes \nof this Advisory are to identify risk factors that may be associated with intraoperative awareness, \nprovide decision tools that may enable the clinician to reduce the frequency of unintended \nintraoperative awareness, stimulate the pursuit and evaluation of strategies that may prevent or reduce \nthe frequency of intraoperative awareness, and provide guidance for the intraoperative use of brain \nfunction monitors as they relate to intraoperative awareness. \nC.  Focus \n \nThis Advisory focuses on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing a \nprocedure during which general anesthesia is administered.  This Advisory is not intended for the \nperioperative management of minimal, moderate, or deep sedation in the OR or ICU; regional or \nlocal anesthesia without general anesthesia; monitored anesthesia care; tracheal intubation of patients \nor those undergoing resuscitation in emergency trauma after the administration of a neuromuscular \nblock, or intentional intraoperative wake-up testing (e.g., for the purposes of assessing intraoperative \nneurologic function).  In addition, this Advisory is not intended to address the perioperative \nmanagement of pediatric patients. \nD.  Application \n \nThis Advisory is intended for use by anesthesiologists, other physicians who supervise the \nadministration of general anesthesia, and all other individuals who administer general anesthesia.  \n   4\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nThe Advisory may also serve as a resource for other physicians and health care professionals who \nare involved in the perioperative management of patients receiving general anesthesia. \nE.  Task Force Members and Consultants \n \nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) appointed this Task Force of 10 members to \n(1) review and assess the currently available scientific literature on intraoperative awareness, (2) \nobtain expert consensus and public opinion, and (3) develop a practice advisory.  The Task Force is \ncomprised of anesthesiologists from various geographic areas of the United States, an \nanesthesiologist from the Netherlands, and two methodologists from the ASA Committee on Practice \nParameters. \nThe ASA appointed the 10 members to the Task Force because of their knowledge or expertise in  \nthe medical specialty of anesthesiology, and the development of practice parameters.  The members \ninclude but are not limited to anesthesiologists with specialized knowledge or expertise in the area of \nneuroanesthesiology.  Two of the 10 members disclosed receipt of funds from or a financial interest \nin a company developing or manufacturing brain function monitors, which companies have a direct \nfinancial interest in the expanded use of such monitors.  Other members may have received funds \nfrom or have a financial interest in other companies, such as developers or manufacturers of \nanesthetics, that may be indirectly affected by the expanded use of brain function monitors.  The Task \nForce did not request its members to disclose such interests because they were deemed too remote \nand speculative to present conflicts of interest. \nThe Task Force, in turn, sought input from consultants, many of whom who had particularized \nknowledge, expertise and/or interest in intraoperative awareness and brain function monitors.  Such \nknowledge or expertise is based in part in some cases on research or investigational activities funded \nby a company developing or manufacturing brain function monitors.  Fifty-four percent of the \nconsultants disclosed receipt of funds from or a financial interest in a company developing or \n   5\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nmanufacturing brain function monitors.  Consultants also may have received funds from or have a \nfinancial interest in other companies that may be indirectly affected by the use of brain function \nmonitors.  The Task Force did not request its consultants to disclose such interests because they were \ndeemed too remote and speculative to present conflicts of interest. \nThe Task Force used a six-step process.  First, the members reached consensus on the criteria for \nevidence of effective perioperative interventions for the prevention of intraoperative awareness.  \nSecond, they evaluated original articles published in peer-reviewed journals relevant to this issue.  \nThird, consultants who had expertise or interest in intraoperative awareness and who practiced or \nworked in diverse settings (e.g., scientists and/or physicians in academic and private practice) were \nasked to participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness of various perioperative management \nstrategies, and to review and comment on a draft of the Advisory developed by the Task Force.  \nFourth, additional opinions were solicited from a random sample of active members of the ASA.  \nFifth, the Task Force held open forums at three national and international anesthesia meetings to \nsolicit input on the key concepts of this Advisory.  Sixth, all available information was used to build \nconsensus within the Task Force on the Advisory. \nThe draft document was made available for review on the ASA website, and commentary was \ninvited via e-mail announcement to all ASA members.  All submitted comments were considered by \nthe Task Force in preparing the final draft. \nF.  Availability and Strength of Evidence \n \nPractice advisories are developed by a protocol similar to that of an ASA evidence-based practice \nguideline, including a systematic search and evaluation of the literature.  However, practice \nadvisories lack the support of a sufficient number of adequately controlled studies to permit \naggregate analyses of data with rigorous statistical techniques such as meta-analysis.  Nonetheless, \nliterature-based evidence from case reports and other descriptive studies are considered during the \n   6\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \ndevelopment of the Advisory.  This literature often permits the identification of recurring patterns of \nclinical practice. \nAs with a practice guideline, formal survey information is collected from consultants and \nmembers of the ASA.  The following terms describe survey responses for any specified issue.  \nResponses are solicited on a  5-point scale; ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) \nwith a score of 3 being equivocal.  Survey responses are summarized based on median values as \nfollows:  \n  Strongly Agree:  Median score of 5 (At least 50% of the responses are 5) \n  Agree:  Median score of 4 (At least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5) \nEquivocal:  Median score of 3 (At least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other \nresponse category or combination of similar categories contain at least \n50% of the responses) \n  Disagree:  Median score of 2 (At least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2) \n  Strongly Disagree:  Median score of 1 (At least 50% of responses are 1) \nAdditional information is obtained from open forum presentations and other invited and public \nsources.  The advisory statements contained in this document represent a distillation of the current \nspectrum of clinical opinion and literature-based findings.§\n \nAdvisories \nI. Preoperative Evaluation \nA preoperative evaluation includes (1) obtaining a focused history (i.e., medical records, \nlaboratory reports, patient or patient and family interview), (2) conducting a physical examination, \n(3) identifying patients at risk for intraoperative awareness (e.g., planned anesthetics, type of \nsurgery), and (4) informing selected patients of the possibility of intraoperative awareness. \nDescriptive studies and case reports suggest that certain patient characteristics may be associated \nwith intraoperative awareness, including age, gender, ASA status, and drug resistance or tolerance.4,7-\n                                                           \n§ Refer to appendix 1 for a summary of the advisories. \n   7\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \n11  Descriptive studies and case reports suggest that certain procedures (e.g., cesarean section, cardiac \nsurgery, trauma surgery) 4,8,12-29 as well as anesthetic techniques (e.g., rapid-sequence induction, \nreduced anesthetic doses with or without the presence of paralysis)2,3,9,13,16,21, 23,30-33 may be associated \nwith an increased risk of intraoperative awareness.  No studies were found that examined the clinical \nimpact of informing the patient prior to surgery of the possibility of intraoperative awareness. \nThe consultants and ASA members agree that a preoperative evaluation may be helpful in \nidentifying patients at risk for intraoperative awareness.**  In addition, they agree that a focused \npreoperative evaluation to identify patients at risk of intraoperative awareness should include review \nof a patient’s medical record, a thorough physical examination, and a patient or patient and family \ninterview.  They agree that patient characteristics that may place a patient at risk for intraoperative \nawareness include: substance use or abuse, limited hemodynamic reserve, and ASA status of 4 or 5.  \nThe consultants strongly agree and the ASA members agree that a history of intraoperative awareness \nmay place a patient at risk.  The consultants disagree and the ASA members are equivocal regarding \nwhether all patients should be informed of the possibility of intraoperative awareness.  The \nconsultants strongly agree and the ASA members agree that only patients considered to be at elevated \nrisk of intraoperative awareness should be informed of the possibility of intraoperative awareness.  \nFinally the consultants  and the ASA members disagree that informing the patient preoperatively of \nthe risk of intraoperative awareness increases the actual risk of intraoperative awareness. \nAdvisory.  The Task Force believes that some components of the preoperative evaluation may be \nuseful in identifying a patient at increased risk for awareness.  An evaluation should include, if \npossible, a review of a patient’s medical records for previous occurrences of awareness or other \npotential risk factors, a patient interview to assess level of anxiety or previous experiences with \nanesthesia, and a physical examination.  Potential risk factors to consider for patients undergoing \n                                                           \n** Refer to appendix 2 for complete results of the consultant and ASA membership surveys. \n   8\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \ngeneral anesthesia include substance use or abuse (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine), a history \nof awareness, a history of difficult intubation or anticipated difficult intubation, chronic pain patients \non high doses of opioids, cardiac surgery, Cesarean section, trauma and emergency surgery, reduced \nanesthetic doses in the presence of paralysis, planned use of muscle relaxants during the maintenance \nphase of general anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia, the planned use of nitrous oxide-opioid \nanesthesia, ASA status of 4 or 5, and limited hemodynamic reserve.  The consensus of the Task Force \nis that patients whom the individual clinician considers to be at substantially increased risk of \nintraoperative awareness should be informed of the possibility of intraoperative awareness when \ncircumstances permit. \nII. Preinduction Phase of Anesthesia \nIssues concerned with the preinduction phase of anesthesia related to the prevention of \nintraoperative awareness include checking the functioning of anesthesia delivery systems, and the \nprophylactic administration of benzodiazepines.  \nAlthough checking the functioning of anesthesia delivery systems is standard practice, some cases \nof intraoperative awareness have resulted from too low concentrations of inspired volatile anesthetics \nor drug errors, including drug delivery errors.8,34-39  One double-blind randomized clinical trial \nevaluated the efficacy of the prophylactic administration of midazolam as an anesthetic adjuvant \nduring ambulatory procedures under total intravenous anesthesiaand reported a lower frequency of \nintraoperative awareness in the midazolam groups compared to the placebo group.40  Two \nrandomized clinical trials examined anterograde amnesia by providing pictures as stimuli after \nadministration of midazolam but before induction of general anesthesia. Although these studies \nreported reduced recall in patients administered midazolam, the presence of consciousness during \ngeneral anesthesia and subsequent intraoperative awareness was not examined.41,42\n   9\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nThe consultants and ASA members strongly agree that the functioning of anesthesia delivery \nsystems (e.g., vaporizers, infusion pumps, fresh gas flow, IV lines) should be checked to reduce the \nrisk of intraoperative awareness.  The consultants disagree, and the ASA members are equivocal that \na benzodiazepine or scopolamine should be used as a component of the anesthetic to reduce the risk \nof intraoperative awareness for all patients.  The consultants agree that a benzodiazepine or \nscopolamine should be used for patients requiring smaller dosages of anesthetics, patients undergoing \ncardiac surgery, and patients undergoing trauma surgery.  They are equivocal regarding patients \nundergoing Cesarean section, emergency surgery, and with total intravenous anesthesia.  The ASA \nmembers agree that a benzodiazepine or scopolamine should be used for patients requiring smaller \ndosages of anesthetics, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, emergency surgery, trauma surgery, and \ntotal intravenous anesthesia.  They are equivocal regarding patients undergoing Cesarean section. \nAdvisory.  Since intraoperative awareness may be caused by equipment malfunction or misuse, \nthe Task Force believes that there should be adherence to a checklist protocol for anesthesia machines \nand equipment to assure that the desired anesthetic drugs and doses will be delivered.  These \nprocedures should be extended to include verification of the proper functioning of intravenous access, \ninfusion pumps and their connections.  The Task Force consensus is that the decision to administer a \nbenzodiazepine prophylactically should be made on a case-by-case basis for selected patients (e.g., \npatients requiring smaller dosages of anesthetics).  The Task Force cautions that delayed emergence \nmay accompany the use of benzodiazepines. \nIII.  Intraoperative Monitoring \nIntraoperative awareness cannot be measured during the intraoperative phase of general \nanesthesia, since the recall component of awareness can only be determined postoperatively by \nobtaining information directly from the patient.  Therefore, the primary issue regarding intraoperative \n   10\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nmonitoring addressed by this Advisory is whether the use of clinical techniques, conventional \nmonitoring systems, or brain function monitors reduce the occurrence of intraoperative awareness. \nThe majority of literature obtained during the search and review process did not directly address \nwhether these techniques, systems, or monitors reduce the frequency of intraoperative awareness.  \nHowever, many studies were found that report intraoperative measures or index values from \nmonitoring activities.  This literature, while not directly assessing the impact of an intervention on \nawareness, often reported patterns or values that occurred at identifiable times during the \nperioperative period with the intention of describing or predicting variations in the depth of \nanesthesia.  Therefore, commonly reported findings from this literature are summarized below. \nThe literature for each intervention is presented in the following order: (1) randomized clinical \ntrials, (2) nonrandomized comparative studies (e.g., quasi-experimental, prospective cohort studies), \n(3) correlational studies (e.g., correlations of index values with end-tidal concentrations of hypnotic \ndrugs or with movement in response to noxious stimuli), (4) descriptive reports of monitor index \nvalues at particular times during a procedure; and (5) case reports of unusual or unintended benefits \nor harms occurring during a monitoring activity.  Correlational studies often report a measure of \nassociation between two continuous variables (e.g., the correlation between index values and \nanesthetic drug concentrations).  Other correlational measures include a prediction probability (Pk) \nvalue that provides a measure of how well a monitor or technique can differentiate between two \ndifferent clinical states (e.g., response versus no response to verbal command).43  A Pk value of 1.0 \nindicates perfect association between an index value and a clinical state, while a Pk value of 0.50 \nindicates a prediction probability equal to chance. \nA. Clinical Techniques and Conventional Monitoring: \nAmong the clinical techniques utilized to assess intraoperative consciousness are checking for \nmovement, response to commands, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, pupillary responses or diameters, \n   11\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nperspiration and tearing.  Conventional monitoring systems include ASA standard monitoring†† as \nwell as the end-tidal anesthetic analyzer. \nNo clinical trials or other comparative studies were found that examine the effect of clinical \ntechniques or conventional monitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness.  Correlational \nstudies reported Pk values ranging from 0.74 to 0.76 for the association between reflex or purposeful \nmovement and indicators for depth of anesthesia.44  One study reported a significant association \nbetween response to command and memory when continuous infusions of propofol were used as the \ninduction anesthetic.45  Pk values for mean arterial pressure (MAP) ranged from 0.68 to 0.94 for \ndistinguishing a responsive state from an unresponsive state, and from 0.81 to 0.89 for distinguishing \nan anesthetized state from emergence following anesthesia (i.e., first response).  Pk values for heart \nrate (HR) ranged from 0.50 to 0.82 for distinguishing a responsive state from an unresponsive state, \nand from 0.54 to 0.67 for emergence.46-48  Wide ranges of mean MAP and HR values were reported \nduring various intraoperative times.  Studies reported ranges of mean MAP values as follows: before \ninduction or baseline, 90 to 103 mmHg; at induction, 58.4 to 88 mmHg; during surgery, 78 to 102 \nmmHg; at emergence or end of surgery, 58.7 to 97 mmHg; and during postoperative recovery, 86 to \n104mmHg.  Mean HR ranges were reported as follows: before induction or baseline, 61 to 82 bpm; at \ninduction, 55 to 67 bpm; during surgery, 74 to 82 bpm; at emergence or end of surgery, 59 to 92 bpm; \nand during postoperative recovery, 82 to 89 bpm.49-56  Awareness has been reported to occur in the \nabsence of tachycardia or hypertension.8,23,24\nThe consultants and ASA members agree that clinical techniques (e.g., checking for purposeful or \nreflex movement) are valuable and should be used to assess intraoperative consciousness.  In \naddition, the consultants and ASA members agree that conventional monitoring systems (e.g, ECG, \n                                                           \n†† American Society of Anesthesiologists: Standards for basic anesthetic monitoring.

It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nBP, HR, end-tidal anesthetic analyzer, capnography) are valuable and should be used to help assess \nintraoperative consciousness. \nB.  Brain Electrical Activity Monitoring: \nMost of the devices designed to monitor brain electrical activity for the purpose of assessing \nanesthetic effect record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from electrodes placed on the \nforehead.  Systems can be subdivided into those that process spontaneous EEG and \nelectromyographic (EMG) activity and those that acquire evoked responses to auditory stimuli \n(auditory evoked potential, AEP).  After amplification and conversion of the analog EEG signal to \nthe digital domain, various signal processing algorithms are applied to the frequency, amplitude, \nlatency and/or phase relationship data derived from the raw EEG or AEP to generate a single number, \noften referred to as an “index” typically scaled between 100 and zero.  This index represents the \nprogression of clinical states of consciousness (‘awake’, ‘sedated’, ‘light anesthesia’, ‘deep \nanesthesia’), with a value of 100 being associated with the awake state, and values of zero occurring \nwith an isoelectric EEG (or absent middle latency AEP).  These processing algorithms may either be \npublished and in the public domain or proprietary.  Detailed descriptions of the various approaches to \nEEG signal processing, including bispectral analysis may be found elsewhere.57  Artifact recognition \nalgorithms intended to avoid contaminated, and therefore spurious, ‘index’ values are an important \ncomponent of the software in most monitors. \n  Although EMG activity from scalp muscles can be considered an artifact from the viewpoint of \npure EEG analysis, it may be an important source of clinically relevant information.  Sudden \nappearance of frontal (forehead) EMG activity suggests somatic response to noxious stimulation \nresulting from inadequate analgesia and may give warning of impending arousal.  For this reason, \nsome monitors separately provide information on the level of EMG activity. \n1.  Spontaneous EEG Activity Monitors. \n   13\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nBispectral Index.  Bispectral index (BIS) is a proprietary algorithm (Aspect Medical \nSystems) that converts a single channel of frontal EEG into an index of hypnotic level (bispectral \nindex; BIS).  BIS is available either as a separate device (BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems) \nor incorporated - under license from Aspect Medical Systems - in ‘BIS modules’ made by various \nanesthesia equipment manufacturers.  To compute the BIS, several variables derived from the \nEEG time domain (burst-suppression analysis), frequency domain (power spectrum, bispectrum: \ninterfrequency phase relationships) are combined into a single index of hypnotic level.  BIS \nvalues are scaled from 0 to 100, with specific ranges (e.g., 40-60) reported to reflect a low \nprobability of consciousness under general anesthesia.  The weight factors for the various \ncomponents in the multivariate model that generates the BIS were empirically derived from a \nprospectively collected database of over 1500 anesthetics.  The BIS model accounts for the \nnonlinear stages of EEG activity by allowing different parameters to dominate the resulting BIS \nas the EEG changes its character with increasing plasma concentrations of various anesthetics, \nresulting in a linear decrease in BIS.  As more data have become available and as methods and \nalgorithms to suppress artifacts have been improved, revised iterations of the algorithm and \noptimized hardware have been released. \nSeveral RCTs have compared outcomes with BIS-guided anesthetic administration versus \nstandard clinical practice without BIS.  In one RCT that enrolled 2500 patients at high risk of \nintraoperative awareness, explicit recall occurred in 0.17% of patients when BIS monitors were \nused and in 0.91% of patients managed by routine clinical practice (p < 0.02).58  A small (N = 30) \nsingle-blinded RCT (i.e., the anesthesiologists were blinded to the recorded BIS values) compared \nBIS monitoring with clinical signs during cardiac surgery), and reported one episode of recall in \nthe clinical signs group compared to no episodes in the BIS-monitored group (p > 0.50).59  In \nother RCTs, times to awakening, first response, or eye opening and consumption of anesthetic \n   14\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \ndrugs were reduced with the use of BIS.8,60-68   \nOne nonrandomized comparison of the use of BIS monitoring versus a cohort of historical \ncontrols (N = 12,771) found explicit recall occurring in 0.04% of the BIS monitored patients \nversus 0.18% of the historical controls (p < 0.038).68  Another prospective nonrandomized cohort \nstudy (N = 19,575) designed to establish the incidence of awareness with recall during routine \ngeneral anesthesia and to determine BIS values associated with intraoperative awareness events \nreported no statistically significant difference when BIS was used (0.18% of patients) compared \nto when BIS was not used (0.10% of patients).  Other nonrandomized comparative studies \nreported higher index values upon arrival in the PACU, shorter recovery times, and lower \nanesthetic usage among patients monitored with BIS compared to patients not monitored with \nBIS.70,71  Numerous correlational studies reported Pk values for BIS ranging from 0.72 to 1.00 for \nawake versus loss of response following induction with propofol (with or without opioids); and \nfrom 0.79 to 0.97 for anesthetized versus first response.46-48,72-78  One study reported a Pk value of \n0.86 for movement from electrical stimulation.44  Wide ranges of mean BIS values have been \nreported during various intraoperative times.  Ranges of mean BIS values were as follows: before \ninduction or baseline, 80 to 98; at or after induction, 37 to 70; during surgery, 20 to 58; at \nemergence or end of surgery, 42 to 96; and during postoperative recovery, 64 to 96.50,51,54-56,79-110  \nSeveral case reports indicate that intraoperative events unrelated to titration of anesthetic agents \ncan produce rapid changes in BIS values, e.g., cerebral ischemia or hypoperfusion, gas embolism, \nunrecognized hemorrhage, inadvertent blockage of anesthesia drug delivery.111-119  Other case \nreports suggest that routine intraoperative events (e.g., administration of depolarizing muscle \nrelaxants, activation of electromagnetic equipment or devices, patient warming or planned \nhypothermia) may interfere with BIS functioning.120-128  Two case reports were found that \nreported patients experiencing intraoperative awareness in spite of monitored values indicating an \n   15\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nadequate depth of anesthesia.129,130  Finally, still other case reports suggested that certain patient \nconditions may affect BIS values.131-133\nEntropy.  Entropy (GE Healthcare Technologies) describes the irregularity, complexity, or \nunpredictability characteristics of a signal.  A single sine wave represents a completely \npredictable signal (entropy = 0), whereas noise from a random number generator represents \nentropy = 1.  The algorithm for calculation of entropy in the EEG signal (as incorporated in the \nDatex-Ohmeda S/5 entropy Module) is in the public domain and detailed descriptions have \nrecently been published.134\nEntropy is independent of absolute scales such as the amplitude or the frequency of the signal.  \nThe commercially available Datex-Ohmeda module calculates entropy over time windows of \nvariable duration and reports two separate entropy values.  State entropy (SE) is an index ranging \nfrom zero to 91 (awake), computed over the frequency range from 0.8 Hz to 32 Hz, reflecting the \ncortical state of the patient.  Response Entropy (RE) is an index ranging from zero to 100 (awake) \ncomputed over a frequency range from 0.8 Hz to 47 Hz, containing the higher EMG-dominated \nfrequencies, and will thus also respond to the increased EMG activity resulting from inadequate \nanalgesia.  No clinical trials or other comparative studies were found that examine the impact of \nentropy monitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness.  One clinical trial reported \nreduced times to eye opening, response to command, and consumption of anesthetic drugs with \nthe use of entropy monitoring.135\nCorrelational studies report the following Pk values for loss of consciousness: for RE, 0.83 to \n0.97; for SE, 0.81 to 0.90.45,136-137  For anesthetized versus first response, the following Pk values \nare reported: for RE, 0.85; and for SE, 0.82.46  Ranges of mean RE and SE values were as \nfollows: before induction or baseline, 98 (RE) and 89 to 91 (SE); during surgery, 34 to 52 (RE) \nand 50 to 63 (SE); and at emergence or end of surgery, 96 (RE) and 85 (SE).52,135,138,139\n   16\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nNarcotrend.  The Narcotrend (MonitorTechnik) is derived from a system developed for the \nvisual classification of the EEG patterns associated with various stages of sleep.  After artifact \nexclusion and Fourier transformation, the original electronic algorithm classified the raw (frontal) \nEEG according to the following system: A (awake), B (sedated), C (light anesthesia), D (general \nanesthesia), E (general anesthesia with deep hypnosis), F (general anesthesia with increasing \nburst suppression).  The system included a series of sub-classifications resulting in a total of 14 \npossible sub-stages: A, B0–2, C0–2, D0–2, E0–1, and F0–1.140  In the most recent iteration of the \nNarcotrend software (version 4.0), the alphabet-based scale has been “translated” into a \ndimensionless index, the Narcotrend index, scaled from zero (deeply anesthetized) to 100 \n(awake), with the stated intention of producing a scale quantitatively similar to the BIS index. \nNo clinical trials or other comparative studies were found that examine the impact of \nNarcotrend monitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness.  One RCT has compared the \nuse of Narcotrend-controlled versus clinically controlled anesthetic administration and found a \nshorter recovery time in the Narcotrend group (i.e., opened eyes) after termination of anesthesia.63  \nPk values for Narcotrend ranged from 0.93 to 0.99 for awake versus loss of response following \ninduction with propofol combined with an opioid, and from 0.94 to 0.99 for anesthetized versus \nfirst response.47,48  Reported mean Narcotrend values are as follows: after induction (loss of \nresponse), 72 to 80; and at emergence or end of surgery (spontaneously opened eyes), 80.73\nPatient State Analyzer.  The Patient State Index, or PSI (Physiometrix) is derived from a 4-\nchannel EEG.  The derivation of the PSI is based on the observation that there are reversible \nspatial changes in power distribution of quantitative EEG at loss and return of consciousness.  \nThe Patient State Index (PSI) has a range of 0 to 100, with decreasing values indicating \ndecreasing levels of consciousness or increasing levels of sedation, similar to BIS, Entropy and \nNarcotrend.  The PSI algorithm was constructed using stepwise, discriminant analysis based on \n   17\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

One correlational study reported a Pk \nvalue of 0.70 for predicting response to command, with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of \n38.8%,77 and another study reported a significant correlation of the PSI with unconsciousness.141  \nReported mean PSI values are as follows: before induction or baseline, 92; during surgery, 32; at \nemergence or end of surgery, 53; and during postoperative recovery, 81.141 \nSNAP index.  The SNAPII (Everest Biomedical Instruments) calculates a “SNAP index” \nfrom a single channel of EEG.  The index calculation is based on a spectral analysis of EEG \nactivity in the 0-18 Hz and 80-420 Hz frequency ranges, and a burst suppression algorithm.  \nThere are no published data on the actual algorithm used to calculate the SNAP index, which is \nbased on a composite of both low (0-40 Hz) and high (80-420 Hz) frequency components. \nNo clinical trials or other comparative studies were found that examine the impact of SNAP \nmonitoring on the incidence of intraoperative awareness.  One correlational study was found that \nreported a mean SNAP index of 71 to be predictive of a loss of consciousness in 95% of elective \nsurgery patients.142\nDanmeter Cerebral State Monitor/Cerebral State Index.  The Danmeter CSM is a \nhandheld device that analyzes a single channel EEG and presents a cerebral state ‘index’ scaled \nfrom 0-100. In addition, it also provides EEG suppression percentage and a measure of EMG \nactivity (75-85 Hz). \nNo published literature was found that examined the impact of Danmeter CSM monitoring on \nthe incidence of intraoperative awareness. \n2.  Evoked Brain Electrical Activity Monitors. \n   18\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nAEP Monitor/2 (Danmeter).  Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) are the electrical responses \nof the brainstem, the auditory radiation and the auditory cortex to auditory sound stimuli (clicks) \ndelivered via headphones.  The effects of anesthetics on AEP have been studied since the early \n1980s.143-145  The brainstem response is relatively insensitive to anesthetics while early cortical \nresponses, known as the middle-latency AEP (MLAEP) change predictably with increasing \nconcentrations of both volatile and intravenous anesthetics.  The typical AEP response to \nincreasing anesthetic concentrations is increased latency and decreased amplitude of the various \nwaveform components.  These signals are extremely small (less than one microvolt) necessitating \nextraction from the spontaneous EEG using signal averaging techniques.  Prior to recent \ninnovations, signal averaging was relatively time consuming (several minutes per averaged \nwaveform).  More recent signal filtering advances have resulted in an instrument (A-Line) that \ncan record and rapidly update a single channel of AEP from forehead electrodes.  From a \nmathematical analysis of the AEP waveform, the device generates an ‘AEP-index’ that provides a \ncorrelate of anesthetic concentration.  The AEP index, or AAI, is scaled from 0 to 100.  In \ncontrast to many EEG indices, the AAI corresponding with low probability of consciousness is \nless than 25, rather than the higher numeric thresholds associated with the other monitors.  The \ndevice is FDA approved but is not currently marketed in North America. \nRCTs that compared MLAEP monitoring (e.g., to titrate anesthetics) to standard clinical \npractice without MLAEP reported reduced times to eye opening or orientation.63,64,146  A Pk value \nof 0.79 was reported for loss of eyelash reflex following induction with propofol and an opioid,74 \nand Pk values of 0.63 and 0.66 were reported for responsiveness following discontinuation of \nremifentanil or sevoflurane, respectively.147  One study reported a Pk value of 0.87 for \nmovement,148 and another study reported a Pk value of 0.99 for awareness after LMA insertion,149  \nDescriptive studies reported ranges of mean values as follows: before induction or baseline, 73.5 \n   19\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

Consultant and ASA Member Survey Findings. \nConsultants who participated in this Advisory typically either had a particular knowledge or an \nexpressed interest in intraoperative awareness and brain function monitors.  The majority of these \nconsultants disclosed receipt of funds from or a financial interest in a company developing or \nmanufacturing brain function monitors.  Consultants were not asked to disclose similar relationships \nwith other companies that may be indirectly affected by the use of brain function monitors.  ASA \nmembers were randomly selected from a list of active members of the society. \nThe consultants and ASA members disagree that a brain electrical activity monitor is valuable \nand should be used to reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness for all patients.  The consultants \nand ASA members disagree that a brain electrical activity monitor is valuable and should be used to \nreduce the risk of intraoperative awareness for no patient.  The consultants agree that a brain \nelectrical activity monitor should be used for patients with conditions that may place them at risk, \npatients requiring smaller doses of general anesthetics, trauma surgery, Cesarean section, and total \nintravenous anesthesia.  They are equivocal regarding the use of brain electrical activity monitoring \nfor cardiac surgery and emergency surgery.  The ASA members agree with the use of such monitors \nfor patients with conditions that may place them at risk, patients requiring smaller doses of general \nanesthetics, and patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  They are equivocal regarding the use of these \nmonitors for patients undergoing Cesarean section, emergency surgery, trauma surgery, and total \nintravenous anesthesia. \nThe consultants and ASA members disagree that a brain electrical activity monitor is valuable \nand should be used to assess intraoperative depth of anesthesia for all patients.

The ASA members agree with the use of brain electrical activity monitors for \npatients with conditions that may place them at risk and patients requiring smaller doses of general \nanesthetics.  They are equivocal regarding the use of such monitors for patients undergoing cardiac \nsurgery, Cesarean section, emergency surgery, trauma surgery, and total intravenous anesthesia. \nAdvisory.  Intraoperative monitoring of depth of anesthesia, for the purpose of minimizing the \noccurrence of awareness, should rely on multiple modalities, including clinical techniques (e.g., \nchecking for clinical signs such as purposeful or reflex movement) and conventional monitoring \nsystems (e.g., ECG, BP, HR, end-tidal anesthetic analyzer, capnography).  The use of neuromuscular \nblocking drugs may mask purposeful or reflex movements, and adds additional importance to the use \nof monitoring methods that assure the adequate delivery of anesthesia. \nBrain function monitors are dedicated to the assessment of the effects of anesthetics on the brain, \nand provide information that correlates with some depth of anesthesia indicators, such as plasma \nconcentrations of certain anesthetics (e.g., propofol).  In general, the indices generated by these \nmonitors vary in parallel with other established correlates of depth of anesthesia, although the values \ngenerated by individual devices in any given anesthetic state differ among the various monitoring \ntechnologies.  In addition, the values generated by individual devices in the face of a given depth of \nanesthesia achieved by different combinations of anesthetic drugs (e.g., with or without opioids) will \nalso differ.  In other words, a specific numerical value may not correlate with a specific depth of \nanesthesia.  Furthermore, the measured values do not have uniform sensitivity across different \nanesthetic drugs or types of patients.  As with other monitors, common occurrences in the OR may \nintroduce artifacts into the values derived by these monitors (e.g., electrocautery, lasers, warming \ndevices). \n   21\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nThe general clinical applicability of these monitors in the prevention of intraoperative awareness \nhas not been established.  While a single randomized clinical trial reported a decrease in the \nfrequency of awareness in high-risk patients, there is insufficient evidence to justify a standard, \nguideline, or absolute requirement that these devices be used to reduce the occurrence of \nintraoperative awareness in high-risk patients undergoing general anesthesia.  In addition, there is \ninsufficient evidence to justify a standard, guideline, or absolute requirement that these devices be \nused to reduce the occurrence of intraoperative awareness for any other group of patients undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia. \nIt is the consensus of the Task Force that brain function monitoring is not routinely indicated for \npatients undergoing general anesthesia, either to reduce the frequency of intraoperative awareness or \nto monitor depth of anesthesia.  This consensus is based, in part, on the state of the literature and \nsurvey responses from the consultants and ASA membership, who generally disagree with the \nfollowing statements:  \"Brain function monitors are valuable and should be used to reduce the risk of  \nintraoperative awareness for all patients under general anesthesia,\" and \"Brain function monitors are \nvaluable and should be used when possible to assess intraoperative depth of anesthesia for all patients \nunder general anesthesia\" (see above and tables 1 and 2). \nIt is the consensus of the Task Force that the decision to use a brain function monitor should be \nmade on a case-by-case basis by the individual practitioner for selected patients (e.g., light \nanesthesia).  This consensus is based, in part, on the state of the literature and survey response \npatterns from consultants and ASA members regarding specific risk factors (see above and tables 1 \nand 2).  The Task Force cautions that maintaining low brain function monitor values in an attempt to \nprevent intraoperative awareness may conflict with other important anesthesia goals (e.g., \npreservation of vital organ functions, minimizing the risks of aggravating existing co-morbidities 152).  \nIt is the opinion of the Task Force that brain function monitors currently have the status of the many \n   22\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

Intraoperative and Postoperative Interventions \nIntraoperative and postoperative interventions include: (1) the intraoperative administration of \nbenzodiazepines to patients who may have become conscious, (2) providing a postoperative \nstructured interview to patients to define the nature of the episode after an episode of intraoperative \nawareness has been reported, (3) providing a postoperative questionnaire to patients to define the \nnature of the episode, and (4) offering postoperative counseling or psychological support. \nNo studies were found that evaluated the efficacy of the intraoperative administration of \nbenzodiazepines to patients who have unexpectedly become conscious in reducing the occurrence of \nawareness.  Two randomized clinical trials examined retrograde amnesia by providing pictures as \nstimuli to awake patients before administration of midazolam and induction of general anesthesia.  \nThe studies reported no evidence of retrograde amnesia.41,42  However, these studies did not examine \nthe effect of administering a benzodiazepine to patients after the apparent occurrence of \nconsciousness during general anesthesia. \nAlthough several studies have applied structured interviews and questionnaires to obtain \nadditional information about reported incidences of intraoperative awareness,4,11,26,28,153-157 no studies \nwere found that demonstrated improvements in patient well-being or psychological state following \nsuch interactions.  No studies were found that followed up on the efficacy of counseling or \npsychological support provided to patients who experienced a documented incidence of \nintraoperative awareness. \nThe consultants are equivocal and ASA members agree that benzodiazepines or scopolamine \nshould be administered intraoperatively to prevent awareness after a patient has unexpectedly become \nconscious.  The consultants strongly agree, and the ASA members agree that, once an episode of \n   23\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

Both the consultants and ASA members are equivocal regarding whether a \nquestionnaire should be given to define the nature of the episode.  The consultants strongly agree, and \nthe ASA members agree that, in documented cases of intraoperative awareness, patients should be \noffered counseling or psychological support.  Finally, the consultants strongly agree, and the ASA \nmembers agree that, in documented cases of intraoperative awareness, an occurrence report \nconcerning the event should be completed for the purpose of quality management. \nAdvisory.  The Task Force consensus is that the decision to administer a benzodiazepine \nintraoperatively after a patient unexpectedly becomes conscious should be made on a case-by-case \nbasis. .  This consensus is based, in part, on the state of the literature and on responses from the \nConsultants and ASA members who generally agree with the following statement: “Benzodiazepines \nor scopolamine should be administered intraoperatively to prevent awareness after a patient has \nunexpectedly become conscious.”  However, the Task Force believes that evidence from the literature \nis not sufficient to provide guidance regarding this issue.  Finally, the Task Force cautions that the \nuse of scopolamine may result in unintended side-effects (e.g., emergence delirium). \nPractitioners should speak with patients who report recall of intraoperative events to obtain details \nof the event and to discuss possible reasons for its occurrence.‡‡  A questionnaire or structured \ninterview may be used to obtain a detailed account of the patient’s experience.  Once an episode of \nintraoperative awareness has been reported, an occurrence report concerning the event should be \ncompleted for the purpose of quality management.  Finally, the patient should be offered counseling \nor psychological support. \n                                                           \n‡‡ Refer to the ASA Director of Communications at 847-825-5586 for further information and guidance. \n   24\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

State of the Literature. \nA study or report that appears in the published literature is included in the development of an \nadvisory if the study: (1) is related to one of the specified linkage statements, (2) reports a finding or \nset of findings that can be tallied or measured (e.g., articles that contain only opinion are not \nincluded), and (3) is the product of an original investigation or report (i.e., review articles or follow-\nup studies that summarize previous findings are not included). \nFor the literature review, potentially relevant studies were identified via electronic and manual \nsearches of the literature.  The electronic search covered a 40-year period from 1966 through 2005.  \nThe manual search covered a 36-year period of time from 1970 through 2005.  Over 1500 citations \nwere initially identified, yielding a total of 711 non-overlapping articles that addressed topics related \nto the evidence linkages and met our criteria for inclusion.  Following review of the articles, 389 \nstudies did not provide direct evidence, and were subsequently eliminated.  A total of 322 articles \ncontained direct linkage-related evidence.  No evidence linkage contained enough studies with well-\ndefined experimental designs and statistical information to conduct a quantitative analysis (i.e., meta-\nanalysis). \nInterobserver agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by \ninterrater reliability testing.  Agreement levels using a kappa (κ) statistic for two-rater agreement \npairs were as follows: (1) type of study design, κ = 0.60 to 0.85; (2) type of analysis, κ = 0.60 to 0.93; \n(3) evidence linkage assignment, κ = 0.77 to 0.88; and (4) literature inclusion for database, κ = 0.76 \nto 1.00.  Three-rater chance-corrected agreement values were: (1) study design, Sav = 0.82, Var (Sav) \n= 0.007;  (2) type of analysis, Sav =0.73, Var (Sav) = 0.008; (3) linkage assignment, Sav = 0.69 Var \n(Sav) = 0.012; (4) literature database inclusion, Sav = 0.84, Var (Sav) = 0.014. These values represent \nmoderate-to-high levels of agreement. \n   28\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nThe primary focus of this Advisory was to examine studies with hypothesis-driven research \ndesigns, such as RCTs, that examined the effect of an intervention (such as a brain function monitor) \non reducing the occurrence or frequency of intraoperative awareness.  To date, only two randomized \ncontrolled trials were found that reported intraoperative awareness as the primary study endpoint.55,56  \nAdditional controlled trials will be necessary before data from published literature can be aggregated \nto provide a basis for quantitative evidence (i.e., meta-analysis). \nSeveral other RCTs were reviewed that reported primary outcomes other than intraoperative \nawareness, including emergence time, consumption of anesthetic drugs and recovery characteristics. \nIn addition, many other published studies applied non-hypothesis driven research designs to obtain \nnon-causal or indirect data.  For example, descriptive literature (i.e., reports of frequency or \nincidence) may provide an indication of the scope of the problem.  Correlational or predictive data \nprovides information regarding the direction and strength of association of values obtained from \npatient monitoring devices with other intraoperative measures such as blood concentrations of \nanesthetic drugs, time to loss of eyelash reflex, and time to awakening.  Case reports are typically \nemployed as a forum for reporting and recognizing unusual or unintended benefits or harms.  Often, \ncase reports, as well as descriptive or correlational data provide useful hypotheses-generating \ninformation that may stimulate additional causal examination of the topic of intraoperative \nawareness. \nFuture studies should focus on prospective methodologies, when possible, that utilize traditional \nhypothesis testing techniques.  Use of the following methodological procedures for assessing the \nimpact of interventions for intraoperative awareness is recommended: (1) comparison studies \nassessing the efficacy of one technique versus other techniques; (2) random assignment to treatment \ngroups with blinding if appropriate; and (3) full reporting of sample size, effect size estimates, test \nscores, measures of variability, and p-values.  The Task Force recognizes that conducting such \n   29\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.  It should \nbe considered final. This practice advisory will be published in a future issue of the journal Anesthesiology. \n \nstudies may be difficult and expensive, because  intraoperative awareness is a very low incidence \nevent.  The required sample size for a RCT to test the impact of an intervention (e.g., brain function \nmonitor) on the incidence of intraoperative awareness is invariably large.  The Task Force also \nrecognizes that, with low incidence data, a difference in the recording of one or two cases of \nintraoperative awareness can affect the statistical significance of study findings. \nLimiting the study to patient subgroups thought to have a higher risk for intraoperative awareness \n(e.g., cardiac surgery, cesarean section, emergency trauma surgery) may allow for a smaller sample \nsize and provide useful information regarding these subgroups.  However, the Task Force recognizes \nthat the generalizability of these findings to the larger population of general anesthesia patients may \nbe limited. \n \nB.  Consensus-Based Evidence. \nConsensus was obtained from multiple sources, including: (1) survey opinion from \nConsultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in intraoperative awareness, \n(2) survey opinions from a randomly selected sample of active members of the American Society \nof Anesthesiologists, (3) testimony from attendees of three open forums held at national anesthesia \nmeetings,§§ (4) internet commentary, and (5) Task Force opinion and interpretation.  The survey \nrate of return was 60% (N = 57/95) for Consultants, and 30% (N=151/500) for the ASA \nmembership.  Survey results are presented in the text of the document and in tables 1 and 2. \nNinety-one percent of the consultants and 72% of the ASA members indicated that they had \npersonally used a brain function device in the past.  Fifty-seven percent of the consultants \nindicated that they make use in their current practice of a brain function device either always \n(11.1%), frequently (20.4%), or sometimes (25.9%).  Thirty-six percent of the ASA members \n                                                           \n§§ American Society of Anesthesiologists, Annual Meeting, October 25, 2004 in  Las Vegas, NV; International Anesthesia \nResearch Society, 79th Clinical and Scientific Congress, March 12, 2005 in Honolulu, HI; and Association of University \nAnesthesiologists 52nd Annual Meeting, May 6, 2005 in Baltimore, MD. \n   30\n \n\nThe following practice advisory was approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 25, 2005.

The percent of responding Consultants expecting no change associated with each linkage \nwere as follows: preoperative evaluation - 82%; informing patients of the possibility of intraoperative \nawareness - 65%; check anesthesia delivery systems - 94%; prophylactic use of benzodiazepines as \nco-anesthetics - 100%; use of clinical techniques to monitor for intraoperative awareness - 94%; use \nof conventional monitoring systems to monitor for intraoperative awareness - 100%; use of brain \nfunction monitors to monitor for intraoperative awareness - 59%; intraoperative use of \nbenzodiazepines for uuunexpected consciousness - 100%; use of a structured interview for patients \nwho report recall of intraoperative events - 41%; use of a questionnaire for patients who report recall \nof intraoperative events - 53% and counseling for patients who report recall of intraoperative events - \n76%.  Seventy-one percent of the respondents indicated that the Advisory would have no effect on the \namount of time spent on a typical case.

      "text": "Case 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 213     Filed 09/12/2006     Page 1 of 4(cid:10)\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\nCENTRAL  DIVISION\nMICHAEL ANTHONY TAYLOR )\n)\nPlaintiff, )\nvs. )       No. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG\n)\nLARRY CRAWFORD, et al., )\n)\nDefendants. )\nORDER\nOn August 9, 2006, the Eighth Circuit remanded the above captioned case to this\nCourt.  In that Order the Eighth Circuit stated, “[s]ince Crawford has now proposed the\nrevised protocol for use in the execution of Taylor’s death sentence, the court remands\njurisdiction of this dispute to the district court for consideration of this newly propounded\nprotocol and all other issues now framed by the parties’ pleadings and notices of\nappeal.”  (August 9, 2006 Order, p. 3).  The Court has reviewed the protocol proposed\nby the State, as well as the plaintiff’s objections and the state’s reply to those\nobjections.  \nI. Revised Protocol\nFirst, this Court’s June 26, 2006 Order (Doc. # 195) was premised on the stated\nintent of the State to continue using the three drug protocol.  However, the Court found\nthat  the lack of a written protocol for the use of these three drugs,  plus an inconsistent\nand arbitrary application of these drugs subjected condemned inmates to an\nunreasonable risk of cruel and unusual punishment. The Eighth Amendment provides\nthat “cruel and unusual punishment” shall not be inflicted.  It  prohibits punishments that\nare “incompatible with ‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.’” Estelle v. Gamble 429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d\n251 (1976), (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 213     Filed 09/12/2006     Page 2 of 4(cid:10)\n(1958)).  As to executions, it prohibits “the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” as\nwell as methods involving torture or a lingering death.  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.\n153, 173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). \nWhile the State’s revised protocol is an improvement over the previous\nprocedures used by John Doe No. 1, it falls short of providing the critical Constitutional\nprotections required.  It was never the intention of this Court to prevent the State of\nMissouri from executing its death row inmates.  Rather, the Court sought only to ensure\nthat the State was meeting Constitutional standards.  Those standards can be achieved\nin various ways.  However, certain protocols suggested by the State fall short of those\nstandards.  If the State wants to continue using the three drug method of lethal injection,\nits proposal shall be modified as follows: \n1.  First, John Doe No. 1 shall not participate in any manner, at any level, in the\nState of Missouri’s lethal injection process.  \n2.  Second, while a board certified anesthesiologist is preferred, the Court hereby\nmodifies its previous order (Doc. # 195, p. 14) to permit a physician with training in the\napplication and administration of anesthesia to either mix the chemicals or to oversee\nthe mixing of the chemicals for lethal injections.\n3.  Anesthetic Depth - The States’ proposal is rejected in favor of that proposed\nby the Court. As noted in the Court’s previous order, the State may have to \npurchase additional equipment in order to adequately monitor anesthetic depth. The\nmethod of monitoring anesthetic depth shall be determined after the State consults with\nthe physician who is chosen to assist in the lethal injection process.  The State has\nagreed to reposition the gurney on which the inmate is positioned, so that the inmate’s\nface will be directly visible to the medical personnel. \n  4.  Contingency Plan - The State’s proposed contingency plan is acceptable.\n5.  Auditing Process - The “Sequence of Chemicals” form that verifies that the\n2\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 213     Filed 09/12/2006     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\ndrugs were given in the order specified in the protocol shall be signed by each staff\nmember taking part in the protocol as soon as the inmate has been declared dead.  The\nphysician in charge of the lethal injection procedure will also complete and sign the\nchemical log.\n6.  Any deviations from this written protocol shall be a matter of written record\nsubmitted to the appropriate state officials and subject to Court review.  Said review\nmay result in further modifications of the approved protocol. \n7.  Obtaining Use of a Board Certified Anesthesiologist - this provision has been\nmodified to allow a physician trained in the administration and application of anesthetic\ndrugs to be involved.  The State’s proposed use of “medical personnel” is rejected to the\nextent they propose the use of paramedics and/or emergency medical technicians. \nHowever, the supervising physician previously referred to may employ medical\npersonnel whom he or she believes are necessary to assist the physician. \n8.  The State shall submit a revised protocol to the Court for review and approval\non or before October 27, 2006.  The State shall select a physician who is in good\nstanding with their State’s licensing board. The physician selected shall not have any\ndisciplinary action taken against them by their State’s licensing authority. \nII. Motion to Withdraw\nAlso pending before the Court is a Motion to Withdraw and Motion for\nAppointment of Successor Counsel.  This motion was filed in the Eighth Circuit, but was\nremanded to this Court on August 9, 2006.  Mr. Simon moves to withdraw as counsel\nfor plaintiff because he has accepted a position with the Missouri State Public Defender\nSystem.  Co-counsel in plaintiff’s habeas corpus and executive clemency\nrepresentation, Mark Thornhill, will continue representing plaintiff in his clemency\nproceedings and Jenner & Block, LLP will continue to represent plaintiff in his lethal\ninjection litigation.  Plaintiff has filed an affidavit requesting that the Court appoint C.\n3\n\nCase 2:05-cv-04173-FJG     Document 213     Filed 09/12/2006     Page 4 of 4(cid:10)\nJohn Pleban, to succeed Mr. Simon in the habeas corpus and executive clemency\nlitigation.  As plaintiff has adequate counsel which are continuing to represent him, the\nCourt finds it unnecessary to appoint replacement counsel.  Accordingly, Mr. Simon’s\nMotion to Withdraw is hereby GRANTED and the Motion to Appoint Replacement\nCounsel is hereby DENIED.  \n  \nDate: September 12, 2006      S/ FERNANDO J.

On October 12, 2006, plaintiff filed\nSuggestions in Opposition stating that the July 14 protocol does not come close to\nproviding for effective assessment of anesthetic depth and also fails to correct the\nadditional flaws in the State’s lethal injection procedure identified by the Court.  Plaintiff\nnotes that the State has provided no grounds for the Court to reconsider it’s September\n12, 2006 Order.  \nThe Court declines to reconsider its September 12, 2006 Order.  As the Court\nnoted, although the State’s proposal was an improvement, there were still several areas\nwhich the Court finds do not meet Constitutional standards.  The State’s response does\nnothing to address these concerns and indicates its lack of willingness to even attempt\nto comply with the Court’s order.  Therefore, the Court hereby DENIES the State’s\nMotion for Reconsideration (Doc. # 217) and restates is previous determination that the\nprotocol proposed by the State of Missouri is unconstitutional because it subjects\ninmates to unreasonable risk of cruel and unusual punishment. \nDate:   October 16, 2006        S/ FERNANDO J.

Summary \nAs set forth in detail in the declarations of anesthesiology professors \nMark J.S. Heath, M.D. (Exhibit 1), and David A. Lubarsky, M.D. (Exhibit 2) \nwhich are attached to this complaint, the use of a specific succession of \nchemicals in judicial executions by lethal injection—which the defendants \nor their predecessors in office have admitted they use—creates a \nforeseeable risk of the gratuitous infliction of pain and suffering, in that the \nfirst of the three chemicals is used by health‐care professionals specifically \nbecause it wears off when the patient experiences stimuli which produce \npain; the second chemical paralyzes the prisoner such that he cannot \nbreathe and he suffers from suffocation, but the prisoner cannot cry out or \neven flinch, because of the paralysis; the third chemical burns as it works \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\nits way through his veins to the heart, killing him with a heart attack—\nwhich to a conscious person is painful.  The co‐authors of a peer‐reviewed \nstudy published April 16, 2005, in the world‐renowned medical journal \nTHE LANCET found that in 43% of the executions for which four states \nprovided information, the levels of anesthesia were inadequate to render \nthe prisoner unconscious at the time of his death; and those executions \nwere in jurisdictions which (unlike Missouri) were careful enough to keep \nrecords and confident of the humanness of their several practices to share \nthese data with the co‐authors.  None of the three chemicals are required by \nMissouri statute; neither any one of them nor the combination of them is \nnecessary to bring about the death of the plaintiff.  Defendants could bring \nabout the death of the prisoner by the administration of a single, lethal \ndose of a single anesthetic, pentobarbital, as their veterinarians would do if \nthey had a pet which they decided to have euthanized.  The Eighth \nAmendment forbids the gratuitous infliction of pain and suffering, and the \nFourteenth Amendment applies this guaranty against the states.  The \nThirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery, of which not only the \ncontemporary infliction of the death penalty but more specifically the use \nof a form of execution more painful than necessary to bring about the death \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\nof the prisoner is a relic, a vestige, and a badge.  Plaintiff is entitled to the \nrelief he seeks. \nII.

Unless permanently enjoined against doing so, the defendants \nand each of them intend to act in their respective official capacities and \nunder color of state law to execute the plaintiff by lethal injection in the \nmanner set forth in this complaint. \nIV.  Jurisdiction \n28.  Plaintiff brings this action to enforce and protect his rights \nunder the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied \nagainst the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, and also to enforce and \nprotect his rights under the Thirteenth Amendment. \n29.  This Court has jurisdiction over this cause under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331, in that it arises under the Constitution of the United States; under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343(a)(3), in that it is brought to redress deprivations, under color \nof state law, of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the United \nStates Constitution; under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), in that it seeks to secure \nequitable relief under an Act of Congress, i.e., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which \nprovides a cause of action for the protection of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States; \n‐ 12 ‐ \n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), in that one purpose of his action is to secure \ndeclaratory relief; and under 28 U.S.C. § 2202, in that one purpose of his \naction is to secure permanent injunctive relief. \n30.

Article 1, ¶ 1 of the Convention defines “torture” as “any act by \nwhich severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third \nperson information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third \nperson has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating \nor coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on \ndiscrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at \nthe instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or \nother person acting in an official capacity.”  (Emphasis supplied.) \n32. Article 2, ¶ 1, provides that “Each State Party shall take effective \nlegislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of \ntorture in any territory under its jurisdiction.” \n‐ 13 ‐ \n\n33. Article 1, ¶ 1 adds that torture “does not include pain or suffering \narising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.”  Because \nthe plaintiff invokes the treaty as providing a remedial structure rather \nthan as a source of substantive law, it would be begging the question or \nbeside the point for the defendants to argue that the pain from their \nspecific method of lethal injection is part of a “lawful” sanction.  The Eighth \nAmendment controls on the question whether such an execution is lawful. \n34. Consequently, because this Court’s jurisdiction does not depend \non a federal statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e would not bar relief even if the \nselection of a garrote rather than lethal injection were a “prison condition.” \nV.  Venue \n35.  Venue is proper in this federal judicial district under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(b)(1)‐(3) in that (1) defendant Crawford resides in its territorial \njurisdiction; (2) defendant Crawford’s decisions regarding the specific \nmeans of using lethal injection are made in its territorial jurisdiction, and \n(3) defendant Crawford may be found in its territorial jurisdiction. \nVI.  Facts \n36.  Plaintiff restates and realleges the contents of each preceding \nparagraph as if fully set forth again. \n‐ 14 ‐ \n\n37.  Defendants intend to execute the plaintiff by lethal injection \nusing a succession of three chemicals:  sodium pentothal, pancuronium \nbromide, and potassium chloride. \n38.  As set forth in greater detail in the declarations of \nanesthesiologists, Mark J.S. Heath, M.D. (Exhibit 1), and David A. \nLubarsky, M.D. (Exhibit 2), the use of this succession of chemicals in \njudicial executions by lethal injection creates a foreseeable risk of the \ngratuitous infliction of pain and suffering.  The use of this succession of \nchemicals, or of any one or more of them, is absolutely unnecessary to \nbring about the death of the plaintiff.  (E.g., Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 25, 36, 41 & 45.) \n39.  Specifically, sodium pentothal, also known as thiopental, is a \nultra‐short acting substance which produces shallow anesthesia.  Health‐\ncare professionals use it as an initial anesthetic in preparation for surgery \nwhile they set up a breathing tube in the patient and use different drugs to \nbring to patient to a “surgical plane” of anesthesia that will last through \nthe operation and will block the stimuli of surgery which would otherwise \ncause pain.  Sodium pentothal is intended to be defeasible by stimuli \nassociated with errors in setting up the breathing tube and initiating the \n‐ 15 ‐ \n\nlong‐run, deep anesthesia; the patient is supposed to be able to wake up \nand signal the staff that something is wrong.  (Exhibit 1 ¶¶ 20‐22.) \n40.  Sodium pentothal is unstable in liquid form.  To be effective as \nan anesthetic, it must be mixed up and administered by a person with the \nqualifications of a licensed health‐care professional.  Licensed health‐care \nprofessionals cannot by law and professional ethics participate in \nexecutions.  (Exhibit 1, ¶ 26.) \n41.  Therefore, on information and belief, the sodium penthothal \nwhich the defendants administer to condemned persons in Missouri has \nnot been prepared and administered by one who is qualified under \nMissouri law to do so in the therapeutic environment.  This fact increases \nthe risk—if not guarantees the result—that the sodium pentothal will not \nhave the intended anesthetic effect on the condemned person. \n42.  The second chemical the defendants use in lethal injections is \npancuronium bromide, sometimes referred to simply as pancuronium.  It is \nnot an anesthetic.  It is a paralytic agent, which prevents any of the \nvoluntary muscles of the body from moving, including those which control \nbreathing, and effectively stops the lungs from functioning.  It has two \ncontradictory effects:  first, it causes the person to whom it is applied to \n‐ 16 ‐ \n\nsuffer suffocation when the lungs stop moving; second, it prevents the \nperson from manifesting this suffering, or any other sensation, by facial \nexpression, hand movement, or speech.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 27‐30.) \n43.  When sodium pentothal is exposed to pancuronium bromide, it \nprecipitates, i.e., returns to the solid condition it was in before the \nexecutioner of unknown qualifications or lack thereof mixed it up in \npreparation for the execution.  Once it returns to its solid condition, the \nsodium pentothal is no longer active as an anesthetic.  Any one of a \nnumber of mistakes—the type of mistakes that one would expect to occur \nwhen sodium pentothal is prepared and administered by a non‐licensed \nperson—or simply bad luck, can cause this abatement of the anesthetic \neffect toward the beginning of the lethal injection.  In the absence of the \nassurance that the executioners have the same skills as anesthesiologists, \nnurse‐anesthetists, or even veterinarians or their staff, the likelihood is \nsubstantial that this will happens in any given execution by lethal injection \nperformed in the State of Missouri. \n44.  Pancuronium bromide is unnecessary to bring about the death \nof a person being executed by lethal injection.  It has the unconscionable \neffect of creating the possibility that the sodium pentothal will become \n‐ 17 ‐ \n\nineffective when the prisoner begins to suffer suffocation from the \npancuronium bromide.  Its only relevant function is to prevent the media \nand the conscientious staff from knowing when the sodium pentothal has \nworn off and the prisoner is suffering from suffocation or from the \nadministration of the third chemical.  (Exhibit 1, ¶ 41.) \n45.  That third chemical is potassium chloride, which is the \nsubstance that causes the death of the prisoner.  It burns intensely as it goes \nthrough the veins toward the heart.  Because the veins are running back to \nthe heart after the arteries have carried it to the extremities, the blood runs \nmore slowly than it does in the arteries.  This prolongs the pain the \nprisoner suffers when the sodium pentothal wears off, as it is selected by \nsurgical anesthetists because it does.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 43‐44.) \n46.  When the potassium chloride reaches the heart, it causes a heart \nattack.  If the sodium pentothal has worn off by the time the potassium \nchloride reaches the heart (as it foreseeably would, given the shallow \nnature of the anesthesia sodium pentothal is supposed to produce, from the \npotassium chloride burning its way through the veins), the prisoner feels \nthe pain of a heart attack, but no one but the prisoner can tell, because the \npancuronium bromide has paralyzed his face, his arms, and his entire body \n‐ 18 ‐ \n\nso that he cannot express himself either verbally or otherwise.  (Exhibit 1, \n¶¶ 43‐46.) \n47.  Veterinarians would not use any of these three chemicals in \neuthanizing animals, because the veterinary profession knows that the first \nis short‐acting and that the second and third are cruel means of bringing \nabout the death of a sentient being; for these reasons it would be illegal to \nuse either of the latter two chemicals in euthanizing a pet.  (Exhibit 1, \n¶¶ 25, 37‐40 & 47‐50.)  They cause pain and suffering far in excess of what \nis necessary to bring about the mere extinguishment of life. \n48.  Veterinarians are forbidden to use these chemicals even though \nthey may personally participate in euthanasia and may also recruit and \nretain the most qualified available personnel to assist them.  By contrast, \nphysicians are forbidden by the Hippocratic Oath and by positive law from \nparticipating in executions.  (Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 55‐58.) \n49.  A veterinarian would use a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a long‐\nacting anesthetic, to perform euthanasia consistently with professional \nregulations, positive law, and the values of humaneness which the latter \nnorms reflect.  This substance is an alternative to the three‐chemical \nformula the defendants use on other people.  Although the plaintiff is \n‐ 19 ‐ \n\nchallenging the outstanding sentence of death against him by other judicial \nmeans (not in this civil action), and has applied for executive clemency, and \nis not advocating his own death, he points out pentobarbital as a specific \nalternative to the three‐chemical sequence, with the amount, concentration, \nand timing, and the qualifications of staff performing and monitoring the \nexecution, to be determined in the course of discovery. \n50.  On April 16, 2005—the day after the Missouri Supreme Court \nset the execution date in the Vernon Brown case—Dr. David A. Lubarsky \nand three co‐authors published in the world‐renowned medical journal \nTHE LANCET the results of their research on the effects of these chemicals in \nlethal injections in the few states which bothered to conduct autopsies and \nprepare toxicology reports, and which did not refuse to produce these data \nfor these scholars. \n51.  This publication is Exhibit 2 to Exhibit 2, the declaration of the \nplaintiff’s expert witness Dr. Lubarsky. \n52.  The LANCET team found that in 43% of the lethal injections they \nstudied, the prisoner had an inadequate amount of sodium pentothal in his \nbloodstream to provide anesthesia.  (Exhibit 2, ¶ 16.)  In other words, in \nclose to half of the cases, the prisoner felt the suffering of suffocation from \n‐ 20 ‐ \n\npancuronium bromide, and the burning through the veins followed by the \nheart attack caused by the potassium chloride. \n53.  Another Missouri prisoner under sentence of death, Timothy \nJohnston, has filed an action before the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Missouri under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 raising a claim which \nsubstantially overlaps with the claim that this plaintiff is raising.  Johnston \nv. Kempker, No. 4:04‐CV‐01075‐DJS (E.D. Mo. Mar. 31, 2005) (memorandum \nin support of motion to compel answers filed by plaintiff Johnston’s \ncounsel). \n54.  Represented by the Office of the Attorney General, specifically \nAssistant Attorneys General Denise G. McElvein and Stephen David \nHawke, the defendants in the Johnston case—including the predecessor in \noffice of defendant Crawford and also defendant Purkett—have resisted \nvirtually every syllable of discover promulgated by Mr. Johnston’s counsel, \nbut have admitted, by their response to interrogatories to defendant \nCrawford’s predecessor in office (Exhibit 3 at 4), that the defendants use \nthe three chemicals identified in this complaint, though the defendants \nhave refused to disclose the amounts or the timing of their injection into \nthe person. \n‐ 21 ‐ \n\n55.  Although a Missouri statute specifies that death sentences will \nbe carried out by lethal gas or lethal injection, it does not prescribe any \ngiven chemical to be used in either process, but leaves these decisions up to \ndefendant Crawford.4 \n56.  In Johnston v. Kempker, the defendants have refused to disclose \nthe training or lack thereof which the actual executioners have had.  Only \nblind faith would lead this Court to find that the personnel they have been \nable to recruit to participate in this activity have the skills of licensed \nmedical and veterinary professionals which would be necessary to \nadminister the chemicals in a minimally competent manner.  (Exhibit 1, \n¶¶ 55‐58; Exhibit 2, ¶¶ 19.f & 21.) \n57.  One of the defenses the Johnston defendants asserted was \nnonexhaustion of administrative remedies.  (Exhibit 4 at 12‐13.)  Mr. \nJohnston’s counsel filed an Informal Resolution Request (IRR) in which Mr. \nJohnston had sought to raise the grievance in his complaint, Mr. Jones’s, \nand Mr. Brown’s, but the Department of Corrections had not processed the \ngrievance beyond noting in writing that it raised “a non‐grievable issue.”  \n(Exhibit 5.)  Although the Johnston defendants’ counsel, Ms. McElvein and \n                                           \n4Mo. Rev. Stat. § 546.720. \n‐ 22 ‐ \n\nMr. Hawke, filed a reply to the response to which this IRR was an exhibit, \nthey did not dispute the plaintiff’s showing that because the issue was non‐\ngrievable according to the agency which promulgated the grievance policy \non which the defense of nonexhaustion relied, the defense was unavailing.  \n(Exhibit 6 at 5 (digitally signed “/s/Denise G. McElwein”). \n58.  On January 21, 2005, the undersigned counsel, while \nrepresenting Vernon Brown, CP‐75, filed a pleading in the Missouri \nSupreme Court in response to its order to show cause why it should not set \nan execution date in Mr. Brown’s case, raising the grievance with the use of \nthe three‐chemical sequence described in the attached declarations, and \nalso arguing that the Missouri Supreme Court should not set an execution \ndate while the defendants’ motion to dismiss was pending before the sister \ndistrict court in Mr. Johnston’s case. \n59.  On April 15, 2005, the Missouri Supreme Court set an execution \ndate on Mr. Brown notwithstanding his pleading as aforesaid, which it had \nduly filed and to which the Office of the Attorney General (specifically \ncounsel of record for the state, Assistant Attorney General Stephen D. \nHawke) filed no response. \n‐ 23 ‐ \n\n60.  On April 16, 2005, Dr. Lubarsky (whose declaration is attached \nto this complaint) and his co‐authors published in the world‐renowned \nmedical journal THE LANCET the article attached to Dr. Lubarsky’s \ndeclaration (Exhibit 2) as Exhibit 2. \n61.  This article confirmed, through the analysis of empirical after‐\nthe‐fact data, that the scientific critique of the use of sodium pentothal, \npancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride creates a foreseeable risk of \nthe gratuitous infliction of pain on a person being executed. \n62.  On April 21, 2005, Mr. Brown filed a petition for a writ of \nhabeas corpus under Mo. S. Ct. R. 91 before the Missouri Supreme Court, \nrenewing the grievance Mr. Brown had set forth on January 21, 2005, but \nwith the additional authority of the LANCET article by Dr. Lubarsky and his \nco‐authors. \n63.  On the same day that Mr. Brown filed his state habeas corpus \npetition challenging this three‐chemical sequence on the new basis of the \nLANCET article, so did Donald Jones, CP‐110, represented by the \nundersigned court‐appointed counsel. \n64.  The Missouri Supreme Court denied Mr. Jones’s petition the \nnext day. \n‐ 24 ‐ \n\n65.  Represented by Michael A. Gross—his lead appointed counsel \nin the federal courts—Mr. Jones filed an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on \nMonday, April 25, 2005, less than forty‐eight hours before his scheduled \nexecution using this sequence of three chemicals. \n66.  The same day, the Court (the Hon. Rodney W. Sippel, District \nJudge) held a proceeding at which Mr. Jones was represented by Mr. Gross, \nand the defendants (including defendants Crawford and Purkett here) \nwere represented by Assistant Attorneys General Denise McElwein, in \nperson, and Andrew W. Hassell, by telephone.  (Exhibit 7 is a true and \ncorrect copy of the transcript of proceedings in the Jones section 1983 \naction.) \n67.  Before Judge Sippel, Ms. McElwein (who had signed a pleading \nin the Johnston case recognizing by silence that the issue before Judge \nSippel was non‐grievable) re‐raised the defense of nonexhaustion of \nadministrative remedies: \n . . . even if you look at this as a Section 1983 action, \nthen it is barred under the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct because the plaintiff has failed to allege that he \nhas exhausted his administrative remedies as \nrequired by the PLRA. \nAnd I think the PLRA is pretty clear that no \naction—it says:  “No action shall be brought with \n‐ 25 ‐ \n\nrespect to prison conditions under Section 1983 \nuntil such administrative remedies as are available \nare exhausted.” \nAnd according to this circuit in McAlphin v. Morgan, \n216 F.3d. 680, which is a 2000 Eighth Circuit \nopinion, states that dismissal is appropriate in the \nabsence of proof of exhaustion.5 \n68.  Immediately before retiring to deliberate, Judge Sippel sought \nto probe the facts regarding prisoners’ having raised the issue in Mr. \nJones’s section 1983 action, in a way that would have disclosed the \nunavailability of an administrative remedy for Mr. Jones to have pursued: \nTHE COURT:  Do you all know?  I mean, it would \nbe a matter of some significance if there was a claim \nthat the dosage, if you will, was wrong and that the \nState should re‐examine the three‐drug treatment \nand use of the three drugs in what order and how \nmuch, strikes me that’s something you might know \nabout if that had been an issue. \nMS. MCELVEIN:  Oh, you mean if he had filed a \ngrievance? \nTHE COURT:  As an officer of the court, can you tell \nme if you have any knowledge about a grievance to \nthat effect? \nMS. MCELVEIN:  No, Your Honor, I do not. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Hassell? \nMR. HASSELL:  I have no knowledge, Your Honor. \n                                           \n5Exhibit 7 at 22‐23. \n‐ 26 ‐ \n\nTHE COURT:  It strikes me that they might have \ntold you about it if that was becoming a big issue \nin the facility. \nMR. HASSELL:  I would expect so, Your Honor, but \nI just donʹt know. \nTHE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Iʹm going to take a \nshort recess and give you a sense of where weʹre \ngoing.  One way or the other, I suspect you might \nbe in another court tomorrow some way, some \nhow.6 \n69.  Judge Sippel went back to chambers with Ms. McElvein’s \nsilence in his ears.  She knew that Mr. Johnston had filed an IRR, and her \nclients had held it “non‐grievable.”  We do not presently have evidence \nthat Mr. Hassell knew about it until the undersigned faxed him to that \neffect while the 1983 was still before the Eighth Circuit; we do have \nevidence that Ms. McElvein did. \n70.  After retiring to deliberate under these circumstances, Judge \nSippel returned to the courtroom and announced that he was relying on \nMs. McElwein’s nonexhaustion defense as his first and basic reason for \ndenying relief:  “the basis of my judgment will be that the complaint fails to \nstate a cause of action under Section 1983 for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies.”  (Exhibit 7 at 30‐31.) \n                                           \n6Id. at 28‐29 (emphasis supplied). \n‐ 27 ‐ \n\n71.  Over a vote of five to two for commutation by the Board of \nProbation & Parole, the Governor denied executive clemency, and the \ndefendants executed Mr. Jones on April 27, 2005, at or about 12:01 a.m. \n72.  Later the same morning (after the fact of the execution was \npublic knowledge), the district court (the Hon. Carol E. Jackson) granted \nVernon Brown’s motion—filed before the Missouri Supreme Court had set \nan execution date in his case—for leave to proceed ex parte to request \nfunding for expert and investigative services.  Thereafter and thereby, Mr. \nBrown’s counsel were able to obtain the services, inter alia, of the senior co‐\nauthor of the LANCET article published the day after the Missouri Supreme \nCourt set Mr. Brown’s execution date. \n73.  After the sister district court allowed Vernon Brown’s counsel \nto seek funding for expert and investigative services without disclosing \ntheir mental impressions to opposing counsel, the Missouri Supreme Court \nsummarily denied Mr. Brown’s habeas corpus action raising this issue, \nwith explanation and without ordering the respondents to show cause or \notherwise respond. \n74.  Vernon Brown filed an Informal Resolution Request seeking to \nraise the issue of the lethal injection chemicals (Exhibit 8), but received a \n‐ 28 ‐ \n\nresponse different from the one which previous prisoners had received, \nwith the special response in his case suggesting that there were multiple \nlevels he would need to go through in order to exhaust his administrative \nremedies (Exhibit 9). \n75.  Counsel filed a verified complaint and accompanying papers \non behalf of Mr. Brown as soon as counsel received the attached \ndeclarations prepared by the LANCET team (through Dr. Lubarsky) and by \nDr. Mark Heath, the leading expert on the underlying mechanism under \nwhich the defendants’ three‐chemical sequence creates a foreseeable risk of \ninflicting gratuitous pain. \n76.  Unless the defendants answer several questions that the \nLANCET team has expressed through Dr. Lubarsky’s declaration (Exhibit 2, \n¶¶ 19‐21), and which are reflected in the plaintiff’s discovery, the petitioner \nis entitled to the inference that because the defendants’ practices are \nsubstantially similar to those of the lethal‐injection jurisdictions which \nconducted autopsies and toxicology reports, which kept records of them, \nand which disclosed them to the LANCET scholars, there is at least the same \nrisk (43%) as in those jurisdictions that he will not be anesthetized at the \ntime of his death.  (Exhibit 2, ¶¶ 22‐23.) \n‐ 29 ‐ \n\n77. In Mr. Brown’s case as aforesaid, counsel learned after filing the \ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nMissouri that the lead co‐author of a study he had already cited before the \nMissouri Supreme Court had completed his Ph.D. dissertation and that it \nincluded evidence bearing on the claim concerning the lethal‐injection \nchemicals and their administration. \n78. By leave of court, counsel filed an amendment by interlineation \nwith memorandum in support raising this additional claim. \n79. Likewise in this action, the plaintiff relies on certain facts set forth \nin the Ph.D. dissertation of Michael Lenza, and in his declaration \naccompanying this memorandum, which is incorporated herein and \nmarked as “Exhibit 10”; his curriculum vitae is attached to, incorporated in \nhis declaration, and marked as “Declaration Exhibit 1.” \n80. Plaintiff tendered Dr. Lenza as a witness at the hearing of May 13, \n2005, on the motion for temporary restraining order in Vernon Brown’s \ncase.  Defendants were represented by Assistant Attorneys General Hawke \nand McElwein, and did not object when the district court declined the \nplaintiff’s offer to present live testimony from Dr. Lenza. \n‐ 30 ‐ \n\n81. Dr. Lenza’s Ph.D. dissertation is entitled POLITICS OF DEATH: A \nSTATISTICAL, THEORETICAL, AND HISTORICAL EXAMINATION OF THE DEATH \nPENALTY IN MISSOURI, University of Missouri–Columbia (2005).  It is \nattached hereto, incorporated herein, and marked as “Exhibit 11.” \n82. Its central finding is that in the customs and practices of the State \nof Missouri, there is a strong historical association between the presence of \nblack slavery, the incidence of lynching, and a disproportionate number of \ndeath sentences after Furman v. Georgia7 and Gregg v. Georgia.8  It bears not \nonly on the absence of a lawful capital punishment régime—which is \nbeyond the scope of this action—but also on the defendants’ selection of \nlethal‐injection chemicals that have an elevated likelihood of inflicting \ngratuitous pain, when they could use at least one (pentobarbital) which \nwould—as they advertise their current practice, in contradiction to \nveterinary law and practice—be like putting a dog to sleep. \n83. In the research for his dissertation, Dr. Lenza discovered that there \nis a strong historical association in fact within Missouri between counties \nthat had the heaviest levels of black slavery until the Civil War, the \n                                           \n7408 U.S. 238 (1972). \n8428 U.S. 153 (1976). \n‐ 31 ‐ \n\nincidence of lynching, and an elevated rate of death sentences after Furman \nv. Georgia and Gregg v. Georgia.  (Exhibit 10.)  In the judicial circuits falling \ninto the slave and Southern cultural regions as Dr. Lenza defines them, a \nhomicide case is 286% more likely to be prosecuted as a capital case and \ntaken to trial as such than in the circuits he categories as urban.  (Exhibit 11 \nat 232.)  Such a case was 71% more likely to result in a death sentence.  (Id. \nat 233.)  Whether a case arose in the slave and Southern cultural regions \nwas the most important variable in predicting death sentences even when \ncompared such other reliable predictors to the color of the accused versus \nthe color of the decedent, whether the accused was a stranger to the \ndecedent, whether the homicide was performed with a knife (producing \nbetter gruesome photographs to inflame the jury), and whether the accused \nhad prior convictions and was represented by a public defender (both of \nwhich are surrogates for lower socio‐economic status of the accused).  (Id. \nat 233‐35.)  These data are not samples, but the universe of cases; there is a \n92% certainty that the associations Dr. Lenza found did not happen by \nchance fluctuation in the data.  (Id. at 235.) \n84. Just as 89% of executions occur in states which used to have \nslavery (Exhibit 11 at 3‐5), the practice of the death penalty in Missouri \n‐ 32 ‐ \n\ntoday is a reflection of the attitudes towards one’s fellow human beings \nwhich allowed slavery to exist and thrive until put down by force of arms. \n85. An underlying explanatory principle is that slavery “vested white \ncitizens with the power of the State to utilize extra‐legal violence to \nmaintain the social order,” i.e., the supremacy of whites over African‐\nAmericans.  (Exhibit 11 at viii.)  Like all Ph.D. theses, this one finds that \nmore research is called for, but also suggests that the results are consistent \nwith the proposition that the death penalty is “an institutionalized social \nartifact of slavery, maintaining the racialized social order through violence, \ncarried forth into our present by our social institutions.”  (Exhibit 11 at 244.) \n86. One of the subsidiary themes of Dr. Lenza’s dissertation is that \ngreater pain was imposed on slaves and their descendents who were \nexecuted—officially or unofficially—than on members of the master race \nwho were executed:  this frequently took the form of burning alive (Exhibit \n11 at 7, 63, 82, 108, 160‐62 & 174‐76), for which potassium chloride is as \nclose as the defendants can get away with in the court of public opinion.  \nSee Exhibit 10, ¶¶ 8‐11. \n87. Plaintiff does not here contend that the death penalty in Missouri \nis unlawful because despite the color‐neutral statutes, it discriminates \n‐ 33 ‐ \n\nagainst men of color and on other arbitrary or independently unlawful \nbases.  Plaintiff does, however, plead—as in an intermediate premise in his \nclaim for relief under the Thirteenth Amendment—that the death penalty \nin Missouri falls disproportionately on African‐American residents.  \nPlaintiff pleads this premise in the course of establishing that the specific \nmethod of lethal injection the defendants have chosen is a badge of slavery. \n88. In support of the intermediate premise regarding disparate impact \nof the death penalty, the plaintiff relies on four additional attachments, \nincluding one which was chiefly co‐authored by Dr. Lenza before he \ncompleted his dissertation.  Because the plaintiff does not advance this \npremise as a freestanding ground for relief, this Court need not consider \nwhether McCleskey v. Kemp9 need be overruled. \n89. In other death‐sentenced persons’ cases before the Missouri \nSupreme Court, the Missouri State Public Defender System presented a \nstudy by University of Missouri–Columbia Professor John F. Galliher of the \nreports from Missouri circuit judges that the Missouri Supreme Court itself \ncollected as the statute on proportionality review mandated.  The Missouri \nState Public Defender System filed this study with the Missouri Supreme \n                                           \n9481 U.S. 279 (1987). \n‐ 34 ‐ \n\nCourt in State v. Parker.10  Plaintiff presents it here as Exhibit 12.  There is \nalso available on the Internet a subsequent report based on later and more \ninclusive data prepared by Professor Galliher’s original co‐author, \nProfessor David Keys, and others, headed by Dr. Michael Lenza.11  Plaintiff \npresents it as Exhibit 13. \n90. The original Galliher report was based entirely on the reports of \nMissouri trial judges in homicide cases that the Missouri Supreme Court \ngathered in response to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 565.035.6.  The report showed that \nout of 439 death‐eligible cases during the period it covered, the prosecutors \nhad waived the death penalty in 212, or 52%.  (Exhibit 12 at 1.)  The \nremainder of the report showed that aggravating and mitigating factors \nplayed virtually no role in determining whether a person actually got the \ndeath penalty for a homicide.  (Id. at 2‐8.)  For example, in respect to eight \nof the fourteen statutory aggravating factors, sentencers were more likely \n                                           \n10886 S.W.2d 908 (Mo. 1994) (en banc), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1098 \n(1995), citing In re Estate of Danforth, 705 S.W.2d 609, 610 (Mo. Ct. App., S.D. \n1986) (providing for judicial notice of the record resulting in an opinion to \ndetermine grounds on which opinion is based). \n11M. LENZA ET AL., THE PREVAILING INJUSTICES IN THE APPLICATION OF \nTHE DEATH PENALTY IN MISSOURI (1978‐1996) (2002), available May 18, 2004, \nat http://www.umsl.edu/divisions/artscience/forlanglit/mbp/Lenza1.html.  \n(Exhibit 13.) \n‐ 35 ‐ \n\nto impose life without parole than death if they found that factor;12 in cases \nwhere accused citizens received life without parole, the sentencer found an \naverage of 2.17 statutory mitigating factors, whereas in cases where the \naccused received a death sentence, the sentencer found 2.2.13  Whereas the \nrelationship between the total number of aggravating factors and a \nsentence of death is positive, it is only slightly so.  (Id. at 2‐3.) \n91. By contrast, the clearest, strongest predictor of whether a \nprosecutor would seek the death penalty was whether the accused was a \nblack person and the decedent was a white person.  In 89% of the cases in \nwhich prosecutors waived the death penalty, the accused and the decedent \nwere the same color, and prosecutors rarely charged whites for killing \nblacks.  (Id. at 11.)  Prosecutors were radically less likely to waive the death \npenalty in cases where they charged blacks with killing whites than in any \nother class of death‐eligible cases: \nFor black offenders 44 percent of those receiving the \ndeath penalty killed a white victim, 44 percent of \nblack offenders sentenced by a jury to life in prison \nkilled a white victim, but only 18 percent of black \noffenders where the death penalty was waived \nkilled a white victim.  These figures indicate that in \n                                           \n12Id. at 4‐5. \n13Id. at 6. \n‐ 36 ‐ \n\nMissouri the race of the victim makes little \ndifference for the legal outcome of white offenders, \nbut for black offenders killing a white victim \nseverely reduces the chances of having the death \npenalty waived by the prosecution—a reduction \nfrom 97 percent of white offenders who had killed \nwhite victims to 78 percent of black offenders who \nhad killed white victims.14 \n92. The Galliher study examined the influence of youth on charging \nand sentencing decisions, because it is a statutory mitigating factor.  The \ndata from the circuit judges collected by the Missouri Supreme Court \nshowed that youth was a mitigating factor for white accused citizens but \nnot for black ones: \nAmong cases where the prosecution waived the \ndeath penalty 14 percent of defendants were 18 \nyears old or less, and 32 percent were 21 or less with \na mean age of 28.2 years.  In cases where a jury \nhanded down a life sentence 9 percent were 18 or \nless, and 25 percent were 21 or less with a mean age \nof 28.2 years—exactly the same average age as for \ncases in which the prosecutor waived the death \npenalty.  Those receiving the death penalty were \nslightly older than others.  Prosecutors perhaps \ncorrectly perceive the common bias of jurors against \nimposing the death penalty against the very young. \n . . .  \nThe mean age of black offenders sentenced to death \nis 27.7 years, and for whites the mean age is 35 \n                                           \n14Id. at 11 (emphasis supplied). \n‐ 37 ‐ \n\nyears.  Twenty‐two percent of black defendants \nunder the age of 21 were sentenced to death, while \nthis was true of only 14 percent of white offenders \nunder 21.15 \nThe authors concluded that “young black defendants are in greater \njeopardy of a death sentence than are white offenders.”16 \n93. Another factor that the Galliher study explored was the reputation \nof the decedent as a mitigating factor.  The data from the circuit judges, as \ncollected by the Missouri Supreme Court, showed that the reputation of the \ndecedent made a difference only if the decedent was white: \nWhile killing a white person with a bad reputation \nnearly always saved a defendant from death, it is \nmuch less likely to operate in the same fashion in \nthe case of black victims.  Perhaps this is true \nbecause all black victims were devalued whether or \nnot they were noted to have a bad reputation.17 \n94. Prosecutors waived the death penalty as a rule if the accused was \na woman, as long as she was white: \nProsecutors seem less likely to seek the death \npenalty against female defendants than juries are to \nsentence females to death.  The application of this \napparent chivalry is, however, differentially \ndistributed across races.  Among death waived \n                                           \n15Id. at 8. \n16Id. at 17. \n17Id. at 13. \n‐ 38 ‐ \n\ncases 20 percent of white offenders and only 3 \npercent of black offenders were females.  In other \nwords, white females were proportionately nearly \nseven times as likely to benefit from a waived death \npenalty as were black females.18 \n95. Dr. Lenza’s study included data into 1996, and was not available \nuntil 2002.  Whereas the Galliher study observed that the reports from the \ntrial judges in the Missouri Supreme Court’s database were incomplete, \nand listed 189 names of persons in the Department of Corrections for \ndeath‐eligible offenses at the relevant time that were missing from the \ndatabase,19 the authors of the Lenza et al. study used FBI Supplemental \nHomicide Reports to enhance their coverage.20  They divided capital cases \ninto three stages:  (1) the prosecutor’s decision whether to charge a death‐\neligible offense, (2) the prosecutor’s decision whether to seek the death \npenalty for a death‐eligible offense, and (3) the result of a penalty phase \nonce the prosecutor had decided to seek death.21  The first stage accounts \nfor most of the decision‐making, as prosecutors charged only 5.8% of \nhomicides (574 out of 9857) as death‐eligible cases; the second stage \n                                           \n18Id. at 16. \n19Id. at 18 & attached memorandum. \n20Exhibit 13:4 \n21Id. at 4‐5. \n‐ 39 ‐ \n\naccounts for the next largest number of decisions, as prosecutors waived \nthe death penalty in 49% of the cases they had charged as death‐eligible \n(270 out of 551).22  Of the remaining cases, circuit courts sentenced 54% of \nthe accused (152 out of 281) to death.23 \n96. At the first stage, in which the prosecutor decides whether to \ncharge a homicide as “capital murder” or “first‐degree murder” \n(depending on the statutory classification of death‐eligible homicide at the \ntime of the case), Missouri prosecutors were almost twice as likely to \ncharge a black who killed a white with death‐eligible homicide as they \nwere to charge a white who killed a black:24 \n                                           \n22Id. at 4‐5.  The authors dropped 23 cases due to insufficient data. \n23Id. at 5. \n24Id. at 8. \n‐ 40 ‐ \n\nAccused/Decedent  Capital  Total  Percent \nWhite/Black  274  2945  8.39% \nWhite/White  12  254  4.72% \nBlack/Black  188  6045  3.11% \nBlack/White  88  599  14.69% \nMissing Cases  12  14  N/A \nTotals  574  9857  5.8% \nThe authors explained that these data confirmed previous studies: \nThe percentages of all Missouri homicides charged \nwith capital murder by offender/victim racial \ncharacteristics indicates blacks killing whites are 5 \ntimes more likely to be charged with capital murder \nthan blacks killing blacks.  Whites with black \nvictims are half as likely to be charged with capital \nmurder than whites killing other whites. . . . this \npattern confirms the suspicion that whiteness is \nvalued over non‐whiteness, predicting that the \nseverest punishment would be visited on cases \nwhere the non‐white offender kills a Caucasian (‐/+) \n14.69%, followed by a descending hierarchical \nstructuring of the proportion of cases charged with \ncapital murder based on racial characteristics: \nwhites killing whites (+/+) 8.39%, whites killing \nblacks (+/‐) 4.72%, to the lowest, blacks killing \nblacks (‐/‐) 3.11%.25 \n                                           \n25Id. at 14 (emphasis supplied). \n‐ 41 ‐ \n\n97. At the next stage of a capital case—the prosecutor’s decision \nwhether to waive the death penalty for a death‐eligible homicide—the \nLenza study found that the color of the accused and the color of the \ndecedent played a strong explanatory role: \nCompared to whites killing whites (W/W) one sees \nthat blacks with black victims (B/B) are 59% less \nlikely to be taken forward to trial, while blacks \nkilling whites (B/W) are 56% more likely than \n(W/W) to be taken to trial.  In the few cases where \nwhites have killed a black victim and were charged \nwith capital murder, they were 115% more likely to \nbe taken to trial than whites taking the lives of other \nwhites.  The last category, whites killing blacks \n(W/B), represents the only 12 cases in Missouri over \n18 years in which white defendants were charged \nwith capital murder for killing an African‐\nAmerican, a mere 2% of the total cases.26 \n98. In contrast to the decisions made by prosecutors, the Lenza et al. \nstudy found, the decisions made by judges and juries in the third stage of a \ncapital case—the actual sentence—did not reflect bias according to the \ncolor of the accused or the color of the decedent.27  The Lenza et al. study \nfound other factors—such as low socio‐economic status of the accused and \nthe availability of gruesome photographs to inflame the jury—that were \n                                           \n26Id. at 15. \n27Id. at 15‐16. \n‐ 42 ‐ \n\nassociated with prosecutorial decisions to seek death.28  For example, \nwhereas juries and sentencing judges did not in fact respond measurably \ndifferently to cases involving the use of firearms as opposed to knives, \nprosecutors were 133% more likely to seek the death penalty in knife cases, \nsuch as the instant case, because they produce more gruesome photographs \nthey could use to inflame the jury, as this prosecutor did, regardless of the \nrelative moral blameworthiness of the offense.29  The conclusions of the \nLenza study pointed to prosecutorial discretion as the main cause of racial \ndisparity in the use of the death penalty in Missouri: \nthe seat of prosecutorial discretion is also the \nlocation of and the mechanism responsible for the \ngreatest racial disproportionality in capital \nsentencing [in] Missouri.  It is those elements of the \nprocess, in the hands of prosecutors, who are \ncharged with selecting offenders and crimes for \neventual capital consideration and sentencing, that \nput in place factors which proportionate sentencing \nhas sought to avoid.30 \n99. In 2001, the Executive Director of the ACLU of Eastern Missouri \npresented data on Missouri death sentences both from the time the state \ncreated a central execution process in 1937 until 1965, when the pre‐Furman \n                                           \n28Id. at 17‐19 & 20‐22. \n29Id. at 17‐18. \n30Id. at 22. \n‐ 43 ‐ \n\nmoratorium took effect, and then from the post‐Gregg reinstitution of the \ndeath penalty until the date the paper was written in October 2001.31  This \nstudy, which was obviously not available at the time of the plaintiff’s \nconsolidated appeal, complements the data the Missouri State Public \nDefender System had provided the Missouri Supreme Court in State v. \nParker.  Initially this paper emphasizes the variation among counties in the \nstate:  several sizable counties had no one under sentence of death, \nregardless of their homicide rate.32 \n100.  From the creation of a centralized state death penalty to the \npre‐Furman moratorium, the split between black and white persons that \nMissouri executed was 23 to 16 over almost thirty years.33  The split after \nGregg was 21 to 30 to one Native American over about eleven years.34  The \n                                           \n31DENISE LIEBERMAN, Legal Director, American Civil Liberties Union \nof Eastern Missouri, PROSECUTORS:  THE FIRST LINE OF OFFENSE—\nPROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION AND ARBITRARINESS IN ADMINISTRATION OF THE \nDEATH PENALTY, http://www.umsl.edu/~phillips/dp/ACLUDenise.html \n(2001)  (Exhibit 14.) \n32Id. at 5‐10. \n33Id. at 1‐2. \n34Id. at 11. \n‐ 44 ‐ \n\nstate achieved this leveling of racial impact by increasing the executions \nper year by about 300%, and killing more white men:35 \nPeriod  Black  White  Native  Total  Years  Annual \nAmerican  Rate \n1937‐65  23  16  0  39  28  1.4 \n1989‐ 21  30  1  52  12  4.3 \n2001 \nTotals  47  43  1  91  40  2.3 \n \n101.  Although this state is executing more white men, its death \npenalty continues to fall on black men convicted of killing whites far out of \nproportion to any other combination of homicide convicts and their \ndecedents.  While the death penalty continues to target black men out of \nproportion to their numbers, it has added white men to the pie of persons \nexecuted and has thereby decreased the proportion of blacks. \n102.  A 2003 article—which is not limited to Missouri data—shows \nthat support for the death penalty among white people tends to vary \nstrongly according to a combination of racial prejudice and the proximity \nof black residents to the person surveyed:36 \n                                           \n35Id. at 11‐12. \n36J. SOSS ET AL., Why Do White Americans Support the Death Penalty? 65 \nJ. OF POLITICS 397, 409 (2003).  (Exhibit 15.) \n‐ 45 ‐ \n\nas the black percentage of a county’s population \nrises, racial prejudice becomes a much more \npowerful predictor of whether a white person will \nstrongly favor state executions.  Indeed, the effect of \ncontext on the relationship between prejudice and \nwhite support is dramatic.  Among white people \nwho live in all‐white counties, the largest possible \nincrease in prejudice (from 0 to 100) produces only a \n34‐point increase in the probability of strong death \npenalty support (from .52 to .86).  By contrast, when \nthe black percentage of the county population \nstands just below 20%, the same increase in \nprejudice raises the probability of strong support \nfrom fairly unlikely (.29) to a virtual certainty (.95).  \nThus, the interplay of racial beliefs and racial \nproximity go far to explain strong white preferences \nfor state executions—but neither factor can be \nadequately understood in isolation from the other.37 \n103.  The case against this plaintiff arose in Jackson County, one with \na high proportion of African‐American citizens, yet one in which they are a \ndistinct minority.  This is exactly the kind of jurisdiction in which the \nforegoing article would predict a high correlation between racist attitudes \nand support for the death penalty. \n104.  As elected officers who retain their positions at the will of the \nelectorate, Missouri prosecutors are presumptively aware of and \nresponsive to the level of support for the death penalty.  In its current form, \nthe prosecutorial discretion created by Missouri statutes leads to racial \n                                           \n37Id. at 411. \n‐ 46 ‐ \n\ndiscrimination in the imposition of the death penalty.  The longitudinal \ndata in the latter two articles cited in this response raise the question \nwhether after Furman and Gregg have addressed various aspects of fairness \nat the jury and trial‐judge level, it is possible in any case for there to be a \ndeath‐charging decision which is free from impermissible attention—one \nway or the other—to the color of the accused and the color of the decedent. \n105.  Because the death penalty as practiced in Missouri both before \nand after Furman and Gregg is disproportionately applied against African‐\nAmerican men like Stanley Hall, Donald Jones, and Vernon Brown—and \nthis plaintiff—the fact that it is more tortuous than it need be is consistent \nwith the behavior Dr. Lenza found beginning with the introduction of \nslavery into the Missouri Territory. \n106.  The use of a gratuitously painful form of suffocation, followed \nby the burning through the veins and the heart attack caused by potassium \nchloride, instead of a single, lethal dose of an otherwise legitimate \nmedication such as pentobarbital is evidence that the state keeps the death \npenalty around primarily for “them.” \n107.  The proposition that the death penalty itself bears more heavily \nagainst blacks than whites is not before this Court as a claim for relief.  In \n‐ 47 ‐ \n\nlight of this fact, however, the additional fact that the defendants use a \nspecial form of lethal injection which creates a foreseeable, completely \nunnecessary, risk of inflicting gratuitous pain and suffering, when the \nexecutions of slaves and their descendants have historically been more \npainful than the execution of others in a slave jurisdiction such as Missouri, \n is a badge or vestige of slavery over and above the existence of the death \npenalty in the abstract and over and above the judicial decision to impose \nthe death penalty in a given case. \nVII.  Claims for Relief \n108.  Plaintiff restates and realleges the contents of each preceding \nparagraph as if fully set forth again. \nClaim I \n109.  Unless this Court stops them, the defendants, acting \nindividually and under color of state law, will violate the plaintiff’s right to \nbe free of cruel and unusual punishments secured to him by the Eighth \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied against the \nstates by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment by executing him using \nthe sequence of three chemicals (sodium pentothal a/k/a thiopental, \npancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) which they have admitted \n‐ 48 ‐ \n\nto be their practice in their discovery responses in Johnston v. Kempker as \naforesaid, which is unnecessary as a means of employing lethal injection \nand not required by the statute creating this form of execution in the State \nof Missouri, and which creates a foreseeable risk of inflicting gratuitous \npain and suffering. \nClaim II \n110.  Defendants’ chosen use of a specific form of lethal injection \nwhich is more painful than necessary to bring about the statutory objective \nof killing the condemned person is a vestige and badge of slavery, and \ntherefore violates the Thirteenth Amendment as well as the Eighth and \nFourteenth, and impinges on the vertical‐equity (color and socio‐economic \nstatus of accused) and horizontal‐equity (irrationality of who among the \nmass of homicide defendants gets the death penalty, even irrespective of \ncolor and SES) prongs of Eighth Amendment analysis (applied against the \nstates through the Fourteenth) as well as the severity prong, the latter of \nwhich is the focus of Count I. \nVIII.  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n111.  Plaintiff has exhausted any available administrative remedy for \nthe issues contained in this complaint, because the selection of chemicals \n‐ 49 ‐ \n\nfor lethal injection is not a grievable issue within the meaning of the \nadministrative grievance procedure as adopted and applied by the \ndefendants’ actual penological agents as distinguished from the \nDepartment’s outside counsel in the Attorney General’s Office, and these \nagents have so informed him in response to his attempt to seek \nadministrative remedies.  (Exhibit 16.) \n112.  As noted, in the Johnston, Jones, and Brown litigation, the \ndefendants initially asserted that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust \nadministrative remedies. \n113.  In Johnston, the defendants’ clients in the Department of \nCorrections had admitted, by signed notation on Mr. Johnston’s IRR, that \nthe issue of which chemicals the executioners use is “non‐grievable.”  \n(Exhibit 5). \n114.  Counsel for the defendants in Johnston (who were also counsel \nfor the defendants in Jones and Brown) recognized this fact by dropping the \nnonexhaustion point in the reply to Mr. Johnston’s response to which the \nIRR was attached as an exhibit.  (Exhibit 6.) \n115.  The same counsel raised the same defense in Jones, knowing \nthat this issue was not grievable according to the Department of \n‐ 50 ‐ \n\nCorrections, in whose favor the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997e is supposed to run; the Court relied on her representations; Mr. \nJones was executed by the use of the specific chemical sequence which Mr. \nJohnston’s pleadings and Mr. Jones’s pleadings showed to create a \nforeseeable risk of inflicting gratuitous pain and suffering in violation of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n116.  As of the time this claim manifested itself beyond cavil with the \npublication of the LANCET article, Vernon Brown was not only aware of \nwhat happened to Mr. Johnston’s grievance but had also heard that when \nother prisoners have attempted to file IRR’s on this issue, the staff of the \nDepartment of Corrections have actually refused to give them IRR forms \nbecause of the Department’s position that the issue was not grievable.  \n(Exhibit 8.) \n117.  Nonetheless, on the advice of counsel, Mr. Brown filed an IRR, \nand this plaintiff, Michael Taylor, submits a true and correct copy of it with \nthe above‐referenced affidavit by Mr. Brown as Exhibit 8.  This filing was \nexpressly made in an abundance of caution and not by way of admission \nthat the issue is grievable notwithstanding the well‐established position of \nthe Department of Corrections, reflected both to the federal courts through \n‐ 51 ‐ \n\ncounsel and to the prisoners affected by the issue by the staff of the \nDepartment. \n118.  Because the issue which chemicals the state uses in lethal \ninjections is not within the scope of the Department of Corrections \ngrievance policy, this complaint is not subject to the requirement of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997e. \n119.  Parties in privity with the State of Missouri, such as these \ndefendants, are estopped to assert the nonexhaustion of administrative \nremedies because the Department of Corrections does not consider this \nissue grievable (and their attorneys know it). \n120.  In Mr. Brown’s case, the staff who responded to Mr. Brown’s \nIRR changed the response from what it had been in Johnston and what Mr. \nBrown had heard it had been to other prisoners under sentence of death, \nand asserted that Mr. Brown—whose execution date had already been \nset—had to pursue multiple levels of review in order to exhaust \nadministrative remedies on the issue.  (Exhibit 9.) \n121.  In Mr. Brown’s case, the district court relied on these \nrepresentations to deny a temporary restraining order.  A divided United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a stay of execution, as \n‐ 52 ‐ \n\ndid the United States Supreme Court over the dissenting votes of four \nJustices, and Mr. Brown was executed on May 18, 2005. \n122.  This plaintiff, Michael Taylor, filed an Informal Resolution \nRequest, and the staff returned it to him with the explanation that he could \nnot file it because the subject‐matter of the issue was not grievable but was \ninvolved in litigation.  (Exhibit 16.)  Defendants’ counsel are estopped to \ncontradict their clients’ correct interpretation of their own administrative \nregulations in order to avoid this issue once more. \n123.  After counsel had prepared and circulated a complete draft of \nthis complaint, he received a telephone call from the plaintiff, Mr. Taylor, \nindicating that the staff had told the plaintiff he could, after all, file an IRR, \nbut that there was no guaranty the result would be any different.  Plaintiff \nis proceeding with the re‐filing of an IRR. \n124.  Pendency of this new IRR need not delay the filing of this \ncomplaint.  Selection of a specific means of lethal injection is not a “prison \ncondition” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), the source of the \nrequirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Selection of a \nspecific means of lethal injection is not a matter of “institutional life” within \nthe meaning of the administrative remedy the Department of Corrections \n‐ 53 ‐ \n\nadopted to take advantage of section 1997e.  (Exhibit 17 at 2, ¶ D5‐3.2, II.J.)  \nDefendants’ agents have admitted the inapplicability of the grievance \nprocedure in Johnston.  (Exhibits 5‐6.) \n125.  This Court should not allow the defendants to avoid \naccountability for their actions by invoking section 1997e.  Their shift of \nground in the Vernon Brown case was belied by their attorneys’ admissions \nin the hearing on Mr. Brown’s motion for a temporary restraining order.  \nDuring the hearing, the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies was \ndiscussed at some length.  Defendants represented the complete exhaustion \nof administrative remedies requires three steps:  (1) the filing of an IRR, (2) \nthe filing of a grievance, and (3) the filing of a grievance appeal.  (Exhibit 18 \nat 60.)  Defendants further represented the grievance is filed with the \nsuperintendent of the institution where the prisoner is incarcerated, and \nthe grievance appeal is addressed by “central office,” which counsel for the \ndefendants elided with defendant Crawford, the Director of the \nDepartment of Corrections.  (Id. at 61‐62.) \n126.  In Vernon Brown’s case, the defendants—who were the same as \nthe defendants in Johnston and Jones, and one of whom was opposing \ncounsel on this plaintiff’s federal habeas corpus petition and on his motion \n‐ 54 ‐ \n\nto recall the mandate of the Missouri Supreme Court—conceded that the \ncorrections classification worker who would address the initial IRR has no \nauthority to change the lethal injection protocol; they further conceded the \nsuperintendent of the institution where the prisoner is incarcerated has no \nauthority to change the protocol for the lethal injection.  (Id. at 61.)  They \nadmitted the only person with authority to change the protocol would be \ndefendant Crawford.  When asked whether an inmate had the ability to \nbring an initial grievance before the Director, they conceded there was no \nprocedure for that: \nTHE COURT:  Okay. Could Mr. [Brown] have \nbypassed the IRR procedure and the grievance?  \nSince it is clear that no one at the institution had \nauthority to make any changes, could he have \nbypassed the institutional officials and gone directly \nto the director with his complaint? \nMS. McElvein:  No, your Honor.  Not that I am \naware of.  [Id. at 62‐63.] \n127.  There is therefore no administrative process available to the \nplaintiff to grieve this claim.  By the defendants’ admissions in open court, \nthe Director’s role in the normal administrative process is to function as an \nappellate decisionmaker, reviewing the disposition of the grievance filed \nwith the superintendent of the institution where the prisoner is \n‐ 55 ‐ \n\nincarcerated.  In this case, the defendants concede that the superintendent \nof an institution, even of the institution where the executions occur, has no \nauthority—no jurisdiction—to change the protocol for lethal injections.  \nThus, as the appellate decisionmaker reviewing any decision made by the \nsuperintendent, the only role the Director would serve would be to \ndetermine whether the superintendent correctly determined the \nsuperintendent had no authority to change the chemicals which other \npersonnel use in lethal injections.  The Director’s appellate role in the \nadministrative grievance process is not the same as his role as the initial \ndecisionmaker.  Here, the defendants have conceded there was no \nadministrative grievance procedure available to seek to change the \nDirector’s position as the initial decisionmaker, rather than in the role of an \nappellate decisionmaker reviewing the question whether the \nsuperintendent had the authority to determine which chemicals to use, \nwhich they concede he does not. \n128.  It is therefore irrelevant whether the staff of the Department of \nCorrections adhere to their correct position that the issue in this plaintiff’s \nIRR is not grievable, or attempt to manipulate this Court as they did a sister \ncourt in Vernon Brown’s case by moving the goalposts. \n‐ 56 ‐ \n\n129.  Missouri does not provide an administrative grievance process \nfor presenting this issue, and therefore section 1997e would not apply even \nif the method of execution were a “prison condition,” even if “institutional \ndeath” equaled “institutional life,” and even if the United Nations \nConvention Against Torture were not part of “the supreme law of the \nland” requiring the United States to afford the plaintiff a forum for raising \nthis issue. \nIX.  Prayer for Relief \n130.  Initially, the plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent \nthe defendants from executing him until the defendants have responded to \nhis discovery (including what appears to be the inevitable time it will take \nto litigate motions to compel as Mr. Johnson has had to do) and until this \nCourt has adjudicated his underlying claim for relief on the merits \n(including the time it would take for any appeal from the disposition). \n131.  Second, the plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment holding that \nthe defendants’ current means, methods, practices, procedures, and \ncustoms regarding execution by lethal injection violate the Eighth, \nThirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. \n‐ 57 ‐ \n\n132.  Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction preventing the \ndefendants from using their current means, methods, practice, procedures, \nand customs regarding execution by lethal injection. \n133.  Finally, the plaintiff seeks an order granting him reasonable \nattorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and the laws of the United States; for \nhis costs of suit; and for such other and further relief as the Court deems \nappropriate. \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays the Court for its orders as \naforesaid. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJOHN WILLIAM SIMON, J.D., PH.D. \n \n/s/ John William Simon \n \nOf Counsel            2683 South Big Bend Boulevard, # 12 \nSindel, Sindel & Noble, P.C.      St. Louis, Missouri  63143‐2100 \n \n   (314) 645‐1776 \n   FAX (314) 645‐2125 \n \nAttorney for Plaintiff \n \n‐ 58 ‐ \n\n- 59 -\n\n- 60 -\n\nDeclaration of Verification \nCOMES NOW the declarant, John William Simon, and as authorized \nby 28 U.S.C. § 1746, states and declares under penalty of perjury all as \nfollows: \n1.

Foundation \n1.  My name is Mark J.S. Heath. \n2.  I live in New York City. \n3.  I earned a B.A. in Biology, magna cum laude, from Harvard \nUniversity, and an M.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. \n4.  I am licensed to practice medicine in the State of New York. \n5.  I am diplomate of the American Board of Anesthesiology, i.e., I \nam a board‐certified anesthesiologist. \n6.  I have taught anesthesiology since 1993. \n7.  I serve as an Assistant Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology at \nColumbia University. \n8.  My work consists of approximately equal parts of performing \nclinical anesthesiology, teaching residents, fellows and medical students, \nand managing an NIH‐funded neuroscience laboratory. \n\n9.  Additional credentials, including 27 publications, are listed on \nmy curriculum vitae, which is attached hereto, incorporated herein, and \nmarked as Heath Exhibit 1. \n10.  As a result of my training, practice, and research as an \nanesthesiologist, I am familiar and proficient with the basic science \ninvolved in producing and reversing unconsciousness in human beings \nand other mammals by means of chemicals, and also in the applied science \nof carrying out this objective through the use of equipment, medications, \nand techniques. \n11.  This knowledge of basic and applied science includes the the \npharmacology of the chemicals, involved in lethal injections as they have \nbeen conducted from the late 1970’s through the present. \n12.  I have performed several hundred hours of research into the \ntechniques that are used in lethal injections.  This research has included the \nparallel and related subject of veterinary euthanasia. \n13.  I have been admitted as a medical or scientific expert witness in \ncourts in Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and \nLouisiana.  I have provided affidavits that have been reviewed by courts in \nthe above jurisdictions and also in Kentucky, New York, Alabama, \n‐ 2 ‐ \n\nMaryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Connecticut, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nTennessee, Texas, California, and also in the United States Supreme Court. \n14.  During court proceedings, I have listened to testimony from \nprison officials who are responsible for conducting executions by lethal \ninjection.  I have reviewed protocols and/or lethal injection legislation from \nMissouri and from multiple additional states. \n15.  I have testified by invitation before the Pennsylvania Senate \nJudiciary Committee regarding proposed legislation to remove \npancuronium bromide from Pennsylvania’s lethal injection protocol.  I \nhave testified before the Nebraska Senate Judiciary Committee regarding \nproposed legislation to adopt lethal injection as a method of execution.  I \nhave testified before the New Jersey Department of Corrections regarding \nproposed regulatory amendments to the lethal injection protocol.  I have \ndelivered multiple lectures on the subject of anesthesia during lethal \ninjection. \n16.  My research regarding lethal injection has involved both \nextensive conversations with recognized experts in the field and personal \ncorrespondence with the individuals responsible for introducing lethal \ninjection as a method of execution in Oklahoma (the first state to formulate \nthe procedure) and the federal government. \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\n17.  Based on my training, experience, research, and analysis as \naforesaid, I express the opinions set forth in the affidavit to a reasonable \ndegree of medical certainty.  The fact that this standard is expressly cited in \nconnection with any specific premise in this document is not intended to \nimply that any other premises are not set forth to the same standard. \n18.  I have reviewed the discovery responses which the defendants \nin Timothy Johnston v. Gary B. Kempker, No. 4:04‐CV‐01075‐DJS, an action \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 before the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEastern District of Missouri challenging Missouri’s practice of lethal \ninjection. \nII. Chemicals Used in Missouri Lethal Injections \nA.  Thiopental (Sodium Pentothal) \n19.  On page 4 of defendant Kempker’s response to interrogatories, \nhe says that the State of Missouri uses sodium pentothal, pancuronium \nbromide, and potassium chloride. \n20.  Sodium thiopental (also known as “pentothal”, and commonly \nshortened by practitioners to “thiopental”) is a member of the group of \ndrugs known as barbiturates.  This group is subdivided on the basis of \nduration of action into the “long acting,” the “intermediate acting,” the \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\n“short acting,” and the “ultra‐short acting” barbiturates.  Sodium \nthiopental belongs to the class of ultra‐short acting barbiturates. \n21.  The medical utility of thiopental is that because of its ultra‐\nshort duration of action it can be used to render a patient unconscious for \nbrief periods of time, in the range of a few seconds to a few minutes, and \nthat because it “wears off” quickly patients regain consciousness rapidly.  \nThe ultra‐short duration of thiopental is medically important to \nanesthesiologists because sometimes during the induction of general \nanesthesia it is not possible to establish an airway for the patient, and the \nonly recourse is to allow the anesthetic to wear off before the patient \nsuccumbs to suffocation.  Procedures for administering general anesthetics \nand achieving a deeper, more sustained “surgical plane” of anesthesia \ncommonly involve “intubation,” or the placement of a tube in the patient’s \ntrachea, in order to facilitate mechanical ventilation.   \n22.  Once the “induction” phase of a general anesthetic is \ncompleted, the “maintenance” phase is instituted.  Typically during this \nphase mechanical ventilation is used to deliver a continuous dose of \nvolatile anesthetic gasses (inhaled anesthetics).  \n23.  If a prisoner being executed is given a sufficiently low dose of \nthiopental he will be similarly rendered unconscious for a period of time as \n‐ 5 ‐ \n\nshort as a few seconds.  He would then regain consciousness only to find \nhimself paralyzed by pancuronium bromide; he would next experience the \npain from an intravenous concentrated potassium chloride injection \ncoursing through his veins and causing cardiac arrest. \n24.  Using an ultra‐short acting barbiturate, which produces more \ntransient anesthesia than longer acting barbiturates, needlessly increases \nthe risk that the prisoner will regain consciousness, and therefore will \nsuffer extreme pain prior to and during his death by cardiac arrest from \npotassium chloride.  Injection of concentrated potassium chloride is well‐\ndocumented to cause excruciating pain in humans and animals. \n25.  Although veterinarians often use barbiturates for euthanasia of \nhousehold pets, they rarely if ever use ultra‐short acting barbiturates.  Most \ncommonly veterinarians use pentobarbital, an intermediate‐acting \nbarbiturate with a half‐life of many hours.  This ensures that the animal \ncannot regain consciousness once the animal has been anesthetized for the \npurpose of euthanasia.  When given in the high doses used by \nveterinarians for achieving euthanasia, pentobarbital produces the rapid \nand painless onset of unconsciousness without the known attributes of \nthiopental such as short duration of anesthesia. \n‐ 6 ‐ \n\n26.  Thiopental has a short “shelf life” in liquid form.  Sodium \npentothal is therefore distributed in powder form to increase its shelf life; it \nmust be properly mixed into a liquid solution before it can be injected.  \nProper mixing requires appropriate training, experience, and proficiency \non the part of the responsible individual.  For example, the package insert \nsupplied with Pentothal, a brand of thiopental, states that only individuals \nwith experience in the administration of intravenous anesthetics should \nadminister this drug.  Notably, the great majority of physicians, nurses, \nemergency responders, phlebotomists, and other health care professionals \nhave no experience with the administration of intravenous anesthetics. \nB.  Pancuronium Bromide \n27.  The second chemical the Johnston defendants state they use in \nlethal injections, pancuronium bromide (sometimes referred to simply as \n“pancuronium” or “Pavulon”), paralyzes all voluntary muscles, but does \nnot affect sensation, consciousness, cognition, or the ability to feel pain and \nsuffocation. \n28.  Pancuronium bromide is a member of a group of drugs called \nneuromuscular blockers.  These drugs block the transmission of the signals \nthat pass from nerve endings to voluntary muscles.  Pancuronium has no \n‐ 7 ‐ \n\nsignificant effect on the brain or on nerves that carry sensory information.  \nThe effect of pancuronium is to render a person or animal completely \nparalyzed, so that no voluntary movement of any kind can be achieved. \n29.  Pancuronium has no anesthetic or sedative properties, and \ntherefore an individual who is paralyzed by pancuronium is fully \nconscious and able to feel, hear, see, and smell.  Because the muscles that \nenable breathing are paralyzed by pancuronium, such an individual would \nimmediately on its administration begin to suffocate, but would be unable \nto cry out or express that he was conscious and suffering. \n30.  Conscious paralysis is not a theoretical construct but is a real \nand much‐feared complication of general anesthesia.  In this context it is \nsometimes referred to as “intraoperative awareness.”  When this occurs, \npatients are conscious, paralyzed, feeling the pain of surgery, and unable to \ncommunicate with the personnel in the operating room.  Because of the risk \nof intraoperative awareness, anesthesiologists receive extensive training in \nthe use of monitoring equipment and diagnostic techniques to ensure to \nthe greatest extent possible that their patients are not awake while \nparalyzed during surgery. \n31.  In Johnston v. Kempker, the defendants’ discovery responses fail \nto prove or even assert that the executioners (or indeed any participant in \n‐ 8 ‐ \n\nthe procedure) have been trained in the detection and prevention of \nconscious paralysis or intraoperative awareness, or that they are even \naware that such a possibility exists. \n32.  The Johnston defendants’ discovery responses do not assert a \nreason why they administer pancuronium bromide.  They do not assert \nthat it is a lethal dose. \n33.  Individuals who are paralyzed by pancuronium appear \ntranquil, relaxed, and serene, regardless of whether they are conscious or \nunconscious.  Pancuronium places a “chemical veil” over the execution, \nand makes it impossible for any witnesses to make a meaningful \ndetermination about whether the execution they observe is being \nconducted without the infliction of gratuitous pain. \n34.  Because the defendants use pancuronium bromide, regardless \nof whether the prisoner is awake or anesthetized, and regardless of \nwhether the execution is humane or cruel, the execution will appear \nhumane to the media and to any other witnesses. \n35.  The inclusion of pancuronium in the chemicals the defendants \ndisclosed in their Johnston discovery responses compounds the needless \nrisk arising from their choice to use a short‐acting, shallow anesthetic \n(thiopental) and the risk of an administration error caused by non‐\n‐ 9 ‐ \n\nprofessional execution personnel that the prisoner will be conscious during \nthe procedure and will experience conscious paralysis, suffocation, and the \neffects of the injection of the third chemical state they are using, \nconcentrated potassium chloride. \n36.  If the sodium pentothal and potassium chloride are given in \ndoses sufficient to cause death, there would be no rational or medically \njustifiable place for pancuronium bromide in a lethal injection protocol. \nBecause it simultaneously suffocates a sentient being and prevents the \nsentient being from communicating the suffering to anyone else, the use of \npancuronium bromide violates professional, legal, and ethical norms for \nthe euthanasia of animals. \n37.  Missouri’s legal regulation of veterinarians, 2 CSR 30‐\n9.020(F)(5), provides:  “All euthanasia of animals shall be accomplished by \na method approved by the 2000 edition, or later revisions, of the American \nVeterinary Medical Association’s Panel on Euthanasia, as incorporated by \nreference in this rule.”  The “American Veterinary Medical Association” is \noften referred to by the abbreviation “AVMA”. \n38.  The AVMA periodically convenes a panel of veterinary experts \nto review, refine, and update a set of recommendations about the conduct \nof euthanasia.  The purpose of this periodic review is to ensure, as much as \n‐ 10 ‐ \n\nis reasonably possible, that the recommendations of the AVMA regarding \neuthanasia have taken into account advances and developments in the \nveterinary field and in the sub‐field of veterinary euthanasia.  The most \nrecent panel released the report entitled “2000 Report of the AVMA Panel \non Euthanasia”; a copy of this report is available under the internet \naddress: http://www.avma.org/resources/euthanasia.pdf. \n39.  The “2000 Report of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia” discusses \nthe use of barbiturates and neuromuscular blockers in euthanasia.  At the \nbottom of page 680 a separate paragraph emphasizes that “a combination \nof pentobarbital with a neuromuscular blocker is not an acceptable \neuthanasia agent.”  While this statement refers specifically to pentobarbital \nit is clearly intended to be generalized to all barbiturates, because earlier on \nthis pagethere is a discussion of the use of “all barbituric acid derivatives”.  \nConsistent with the veterinary practice set forth at the top of page 680 the \nAVMA recommends the use of pentobarbital (not thiopental) on animals in \npart because it is long‐acting (in contrast to the ultra‐short acting thiopental \nwhich the defendants use on condemned prisoners).  Indeed, the use of \nthiopental in combination with a neuromuscular blocker would certainly \nbe considered by the AVMA to be even more unacceptable than the use of \npentobarbital with a neuromuscular blocker, because of the increased \n‐ 11 ‐ \n\nchance (compared with pentobarbital) that the animal would regain \nconsciousness. \n40.  The selection of chemicals to which the Johnston defendants \nadmit fails to comply with the professional and legally‐recognized \nstandards for euthanizing animals which the AVMA Panel Report on \nEuthanasia promulgates.  These veterinary norms reflect the high level of \nattention that is directed towards preventing and eliminating the \npossibility of conscious suffocation due to chemical paralysis. \n41.  Defendants’ choice to use the combination of a barbiturate with \na neuromuscular blocker is completely unnecessary to bring about the \nstatutory object of causing the death of the prisoner.  It compounds the risk \nof causing gratuitous pain which results from the defendants’ use of an \nultra‐short acting barbiturate in the first place, their declining to reveal the \nquantity to be used, the likelihood of administration errors caused by their \nuse of executioners whose ability to monitor anesthetic depth is unknown, \nthe needless use of pancuronium bromide (compounded by the use of the \npainful agent potassium chloride, the next chemical to be discussed), and \nthe failure to verify anesthetic depth before intravenously administering \nthe concentrated potassium chloride. \n‐ 12 ‐ \n\n42.  If administered alone, a lethal dose of pancuronium bromide \nwould not immediately cause a human being to lose consciousness.  It \nwould totally immobilize him by paralyzing all voluntary muscles and the \ndiaphragm, causing him to suffocate to death while experiencing an \nintense, conscious desire to inhale.  Ultimately the condemned inmate \nwould lose consciousness, but it would not be as an immediate and direct \nresult of the pancuronium bromide.  Rather, the loss of consciousness \nwould be due to suffocation, and would be preceded by the torment and \nagony caused by suffocation. \nC.  Potassium Chloride \n43.  Potassium chloride (KCl) is a common salt composed of \npotassium and chlorine.  Potassium is vital in the human body, and oral \npotassium chloride is the common means to replenish it, although it can \nalso be administered intravenously if highly diluted.  Medically it is used \nin the treatment of hypokalemia (low concentration of potassium in the \nblood).  When administered rapidly by intravenous route, potassium \nchloride travels via the venous system to the heart and interferes with the \nnormal electrical activity of the heart, causing the heart to stop pumping \nblood (“cardiac arrest”) and death. \n‐ 13 ‐ \n\n44.  The intravenous administration of concentrated potassium \nchloride is extremely painful.  In clinical settings, potassium chloride is \nused in much lower concentrations in part so as to avoid this excruciating \npain.  Veins are richly supplied with sensory nerve endings that can signal \nextremely high levels of pain.  Concentrated potassium strongly activates \nthese fibers, and causes an excruciating searing or burning sensation that is \nlikened to that of boiling oil or branding with a red hot iron. \n45.  There are many possible alternative drugs or chemical agents \nthat are equally effective in causing and maintaining cardiac arrest but that \ndo not cause pain.  Such non‐painful drugs are used by veterinarians to \nproduce and maintain cardiac arrest during euthanasia of animals. \n46.  The inclusion of potassium chloride by the Johnston defendants’ \nadmission compounds the risk presented by the needless selection of an \nultrashort‐acting barbiturate, the defendants’ declining to reveal the doses \nof drugs to be used, the likelihood of administration errors caused by \nexecutioners whose credentials or lack thereof the Johnson defendants have \nnot revealed, and the needless use of pancuronium, that the prisoner will \nbe conscious during the procedure and will experience the excruciating \ntorments of conscious paralysis and intravenous concentrated potassium. \n‐ 14 ‐ \n\n47.  Page 680 of the AVMA report states that “although \nunacceptable and condemned when used in unanaesthetized animals, the \nuse of a supersaturated solution of potassium chloride injected \nintravenously or intracardially is an acceptable method to produce cardiac \narrest and death.”  This statement firmly establishes the utter \nunacceptability of administering potassium chloride to an animal that is \nnot anesthetized. \n48.  On page 681 the AVMA report goes on to state that “[i]t is of \nutmost importance that personnel performing this technique are trained \nand knowledgeable in anesthetic techniques, and are competent in \nassessing anesthetic depth appropriate for administration of potassium \nchloride intravenously.”  The Johnston defendants have declined to provide \nany information about presence or absence of training, competency, or \nproficiency of the executioners in the assessment of anesthetic depth.  The \nJohnston defendants have placed in doubt the proposition that anyone \ninvolved in conceiving or reviewing the entire lethal injection rite in \nMissouri has the requisite training in anesthetic techniques to assess \nanesthetic depth as required by the AVMA prior to the administration of \npotassium on an animal.  \n‐ 15 ‐ \n\n49.  On page 681 the AVMA report also states that “administration \nof potassium chloride intravenously requires animals to be in a surgical \nplane of anesthesia characterized by a loss of consciousness, loss of reflex \nmuscle response, and loss of response to noxious stimuli.”  The information \nthe Johnston defendants have chosen to provide in response to discovery \ndoes not indicate the existence of attempts to conduct any such testing, let \nalone the presence among the executioners of persons qualified to do so. \n50.  The use of pancuronium greatly increases the difficulty of \nmaking the assessment of anesthetic depth as described and required by \nthe AVMA report.  For example, a common way in which veterinarians \nassess anesthetic depth is to use a surgical clamp to pinch the tail or paw.  \nIf the animal is not adequately anesthetized it will withdraw the pinched \nappendage, and may possible exhibit generalized escape or withdrawal \nresponses, and may even vocalize.  By contrast, if an animal is adequately \nanesthetized it will not exhibit any of these responses.  Of course, if the \nanimal has been administered a neuromuscular blocker such as \npancuronium, this pinch test cannot be used, because the animal will not \nbe able to exhibit such reflexive withdrawal responses because it is \nparalyzed.  If the animal is not properly anesthetized it will feel the \nextreme pain caused by the clamping of its tail or paw, but will be unable \n‐ 16 ‐ \n\nto withdraw, struggle, or vocalize because of the entombing effect of \npancuronium.  If the veterinarian is not closely monitoring subtle \nindicators of anesthetic depth such as pupil size, heart rate, and blood \npressure, they would have no knowledge that the animal is in fact feeling \nthe pain but unable to respond. \n51.  Although the Johnston defendants do not claim that there is any \nattempt to assess or verify anesthetic depth prior to the administration of \npotassium chloride, any hypothetical attempt to assess anesthetic depth \nwould be made much more challenging and subject to error by their \nneedless administration of pancuronium.  Further, such hypothetical \nattempts to ascertain anesthetic depth prior to the administration of \npotassium would be thwarted if monitoring equipment such as an EKG \nand blood pressure cuff is not present, in use, and under the supervision of \nan individual who is trained to use them to assess anesthetic depth. \n52.  The failure of the defendants/respondents to comply with the \nAVMA Panel Report on Euthanasia by specifying the assessment and \nverification of anesthetic depth prior to the administration of potassium \nchloride compounds the risk presented by the relatively low dose of \nthiopental, and compounds the risk presented by the use of an ultra‐short \nacting barbiturate, and compounds the risk of an administration error \n‐ 17 ‐ \n\ncaused by inadequately proficient execution personnel, and compounds \nthe risk engendered by the needless use of pancuronium, and compounds \nwith the use of the painful agent potassium chloride, that the inmate will \nbe conscious during the procedure and will experience the excruciating \ntorments of conscious paralysis and intravenous concentrated potassium \nchloride. \n53.  If the individuals conducting an execution by lethal injection do \nnot properly mix and inject thiopental (sodium pentothal), in a dose \nsufficient to cause death or at least the loss of consciousness for the \nduration of the plaintiff or petitioner’s execution, then it is my opinion to a \nreasonable degree of medical certainty that the use of pancuronium \nbromide places the plaintiff or petitioner at undue and unnecessary risk of \nconsciously experiencing paralysis, suffocation, and the excruciating pain \nof the intravenous injection of the respondent’s high dose of the third \nchemical, potassium chloride.  Based on the information the Johnston \ndefendants have chosen to release, it is my opinion to a reasonable degree \nof medical certainty that the defendants’ lethal injection practices create a \nforeseeable risk that the plaintiff/petitioner will not be anesthetized to the \npoint of being unconscious and unaware of the pain for the duration of the \nexecution procedure, when this risk is absolutely unnecessary to the \n‐ 18 ‐ \n\nstatutory purpose of bringing about the death of the plaintiff/petitioner.  If \nthe condemned prisoner is not first anesthetized, it is my opinion to a \nreasonable degree of medical certainty that the pancuronium bromide will \nparalyze all voluntary muscles and mask external, physical indications of \nthe excruciating pain being experienced by the prisoner during the process \nof suffocating (caused by the pancuronium bromide) and intravenous \npotassium administration. \n54.  Defendants/respondents’ execution protocol requires the \npresence of media witnesses to the execution, and permits the presence of \nwitnesses chosen by the condemned prisoner and witnesses chosen by the \nhomicide decedent’s surviving family members.  The use of pancuronium \nbromide effectively nullifies the ability of witnesses to discern whether or \nnot the condemned prisoner is experiencing a peaceful death or an \nagonizing death.  Regardless of the experience of the condemned prisoner \n(i.e. whether he is deeply unconscious or experiencing the excruciation of \nsuffocation, paralysis, and potassium chloride injection) he will appear to \nwitnesses to be serene and peaceful due to the defendants/respondents’ \nchoice to use pancuronium to institute paralysis.  It is unconscionable that \nthe lethal injection protocol would specify the use of a superfluous drug \nthat thwarts the ability of the witnesses to ascertain whether or not the \n‐ 19 ‐ \n\nprocedure is humane.  If the witness cannot ascertain whether the \nprocedure is humane, then there is no means by which the citizens of \nMissouri or the Court can know whether or not the procedure is humane. \nIII. Qualifications and Training of Executioners \n55.  The information about their lethal injection practices which the \nJohnston defendants have chosen to reveal do not include procedures \ndesigned to ensure the proper preparation of the chemicals used.  They \nhave declined to provide any of the facts regarding the credentials, \ncertification, experience, or proficiency of the personnel who are \nresponsible for the mixing of the drugs, or for the drawing up of the drugs \ninto syringes. \n56.  Preparation of drugs, particularly for intravenous use, is a \ntechnical task requiring significant training in pharmaceutical concepts and \ncalculations.  It is my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical \ncertainty, and based on my review of lethal injection procedures in various \njurisdictions, that there exist many risks associated with drug preparation \nwhich, if not properly accounted for, further elevate the risk that a prisoner \nwill consciously experience excruciating pain during the lethal injection. \n‐ 20 ‐ \n\n57.  The information the Johnston defendants have chosen to make \navailable provides inadequate data regarding the training, credentials, \ncertification, experience, and proficiency of any prison employee or \ncontractor who performs the execution procedure.  Their declining to \nsupply such information—let alone the ultimate details of their licensure \nand work history—raises critical questions about the degree to which the \ncondemned prisoners are at risk of excruciating pain during their \nexecutions.  It is my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical \ncertainty that the correct and safe management of intravenous drug and \nfluid administration requires a significant level of professional acumen, \nand cannot be adequately performed by personnel lacking the requisite \ntraining and experience.  If a person had invested the time and other \nresources into acquiring this proficiency, it would be my experience in the \npractice of medicine that they would obtain a license and practice in their \narea of health care rather than being an executioner. \n58.  The great majority of nurses are not trained in the use of ultra‐\nshort acting barbiturates; indeed, this class of drugs is essentially only used \nby nurses who have significant experience in intensive care units and as \nnurse anesthetists.  Very few paramedics or ex‐military corpsmen are \ntrained or experienced in the use of ultra‐short acting barbiturates, such as \n‐ 21 ‐ \n\nthiopental (sodium pentothal).  Based on my medical training and \nexperience, and based upon his research of lethal injection procedures and \npractices, inadequacies in these areas elevate the risk that the lethal \ninjection procedure will cause the prisoner to suffer excruciating pain \nduring the execution. \n‐ 22 ‐ \n\n59.  Based on my research into methods of lethal injection used by \nvarious states and the federal government, and based on my training and \nexperience as a medical doctor specializing in anesthesiology, it is my \nopinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty that, given the \napparent absence of a central role for a properly trained medical or even \nveterinary professional in the defendants/respondents’ execution \nprocedure in Missouri, it can and should be presumed that the lethal \ninjection procedure which the defendants/respondents use creates \nforeseeable risks of inflicting excruciating pain and suffering on the \nprisoner during the lethal injection procedure when to do so is unnecessary \nto bring about the death of the prisoner. \nFurther, the declarant sayeth naught. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted:  ___May 9, 2005________________ \n \n_____________________________ \nMARK J.S. HEATH, M.D. \nAssistant Professor of Clinical \n  Anesthesiology \nCollege of Physicians & Surgeons \nColumbia University \nNew York, New York  10024 \n‐ 23 ‐ \n\nCurriculum Vitae \n \n \n1)  Date of preparation:  December 19, 2004 \n \n2)  Name:     Mark J.

My name is David A. Lubarsky. \n2.  I live in Miami, Florida. \n3.  I graduated from Washington University with a B.A. in 1980 and \nan M.D. in 1984. \n4.  I also hold an M.B.A. from Duke University (1999). \n5.  I am licensed to practice medicine in the States of New York \n(1985), North Carolina (1988) and Florida (2002).  I moved from North \nCarolina to Florida, and while applying for a full license, in 2001 and early \n2002, held a Florida Board of Medicine Medical Faculty Certificate. \n6.  I am board‐certified by the National Board of Medical Examiners, \nthe American Board of Anesthesiology (placing in the 99th percentile on \nPart I of its examination), recently completed the American Board of \nAnesthesiology Maintenance of Certification Exam (2004) and am certified \nby the American Academy of Pain Management. \n7.  I serve as the Emanuel M. Papper Professor and Chairman, \nDepartment of Anesthesiology, University of Miami School of Medicine, \n\nwith a secondary academic appointment as Professor, Department of \nManagement, University of Miami School of Business. \n8.  I have published, as author or co‐author, 127 books, chapters, \nmonographs, journal articles, and other publications or abstracts, primarily \nin the area of anesthesiology.  I have also made video presentations and \nother private‐sector publications, contributed to conference proceedings \nand newsletters, and created electronic, World Wide Web, and/or Internet \npublications related to my work. \n9.  I have lectured, appeared on panels, and served as a visiting \nprofessor throughout the United States and in, Paris, Hong Kong, and \nJapan. \n10. I have been retained as an expert witness in approximately 50 \nmalpractice cases and given about 20 depositions. \n11. My credentials are set forth in greater detail in the curriculum \nvitae, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto, incorporated \nherein, and marked as Lubarsky Exhibit 1. \n12. Together with Leonidas Koniaris, M.D., Teresa A. Zimmers, Ph.D., \nand Jonathan P. Sheldon, J.D., I conducted the research and reported the \nfindings contained in “Inadequate anesthesia in lethal injection for \nexecution” in THE LANCET, volume 365, pages 1412‐14, published on April \n‐ 2 ‐ \n\n16, 2005, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto, incorporated \nherein, and marked as Lubarsky Exhibit 2. \n13. THE LANCET is one of the most prestigious medical journals in the \nworld.  All publications go through a rigorous process of review for both \npertinence and scientific method.  Usually at least two reviewers eminent \nin the field being investigated provide input to an editor in charge of the \nsection in which the paper will be published.  Among the methods \nevaluated are how data were collected, and statistical analysis of that data.  \nFurthermore, conclusions are carefully monitored for faithfulness to the \ndata described in the paper.   \n14. Our research dealt with the process of injecting a person sentenced \nto death with a succession of three chemicals:  thiopental (also known as \nsodium pentothal), pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride, and \nraised the question whether the levels of thiopental in the bloodstream of \nthe person being executed were high enough to produce unconsciousness \nthroughout the execution and whether the protocols provided by Texas \nand Virginia would absolutely produce a foolproof method of humane \nexecution. \n15. Each of the propositions of fact set forth in the LANCET article as \naforesaid reflects my opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. \n‐ 3 ‐ \n\n16. Based on our research, the article concludes that toxicology reports \nfrom the four lethal‐injection jurisdictions which provided them showed \nthat post‐mortem concentrations of thiopental (sodium pentothal) in the \nblood of persons who had been executed were lower than that required for \nsurgery in 43 of 49 cases reported (88%), and 21 (43%) inmates had \nconcentrations consistent with awareness.  This conclusion reflects my \nopinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. \n17. My LANCET co‐authors and I have reviewed the discovery \nresponses which the Missouri defendants have thus far provided in \nTimothy Johnston v. Gary B. Kempker, et al., 4:04‐CV‐1075‐DJS (U.S. Dist. Ct. \nE.D. Mo.), as forwarded to us by counsel for Vernon Brown. \n18. On the basis of the data which these representatives of the State of \nMissouri have provided, and from the fact that according to these data, the \nprocedure in Missouri is not substantially dissimilar to the procedure in the \nstates which kept and provided toxicology data, I draw the inference, to a \nreasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the levels of thiopental \n(sodium pentothal) in the bloodstreams of persons executed by lethal \ninjection in Missouri are, at best, similar to those levels executed in the four \nstates which kept and provided toxicology data. \n‐ 4 ‐ \n\n19. In order for us to reject the inference that because the basic \nprocedure in Missouri is the same as in the states for which we have \ntoxicology data, the results are the same in Missouri as in those states, \nrepresentatives of the State of Missouri would have to provide the \nfollowing data: \na.  Documented blood levels of thiopental, showing \nadequate anesthesia at the time of death, of each person \nexecuted; \nb.  Documented post‐mortem blood levels showing adequate \nlevels of anesthesia post‐mortem of each person executed,  \nc.  The time from administration of each of the three \nchemicals to the time of death of each person executed; \nd.  The quantity of each of the three chemicals administered \nto each person executed; \ne.  The protocol of execution; \nf.  The training of each individual performing each \nexecution; \n‐ 5 ‐ \n\n20. In order to render a prospective evaluation about an execution \nthat the State of Missouri intends to carry out in the future, based on its \nhaving carried them out in the past, my co‐authors and I would need the \nfollowing information: \na.  Any and all post‐mortem reports on the persons executed \nby lethal injection in Missouri, including autopsy reports, \nMedical Examiner investigative reports, all post‐mortem \ntoxicology including blood, vitreous and other fluids, \nexact identification of all blood sampling sites, and the \ntiming of all samples drawn, and the timing of all tests \nrun, and the method of storage of samples between \nsampling and testing.  Toxicology reports alone are often \nincomplete, lacking sample collection time, site of \ncollection, so reviewing the complete autopsy and \ntoxicology original study is necessary.   \nb.  In order to rule out the foreseeable risk of the gratuitous \ninfliction of pain in a future lethal injection, we would \nneed to have access to the standard operating procedures \n‐ 6 ‐ \n\nfor the autopsy procedures themselves.  As North \nCarolina performed toxicology analysis without a full \nautopsy, we would specifically need the results from all \npost‐mortem investigative procedures, not only \nautopsies.  To the extent these procedures fell short of \nprofessional norms for a full autopsy, they may be \ninadequate to rule out the foreseeable risk of the \ngratuitous infliction of pain. \nc.  We would need the most complete available description \nof the protocol itself, including identity and training of \nexecutioners, number of intravenous (IV) lines, \npreparation of the drugs, the dosages, the order of \nadministration, rate of administration, backup plan, etc.  \nIs there monitoring for depth of anesthesia?  Are heart \nrate monitors are used strictly to determine death? \nd.  In order to render certain other data reliable, we would \nneed to know the protocol for determining death.  In \nNorth Carolina, staff claim to watch the monitor flat‐line \n‐ 7 ‐ \n\nfor five minutes, and then call a doctor in to pronounce \ndeath, but there is reason to think this is not always the \nprocedure.  Any fact tending to draw in question the \ntiming of death would undermine our confidence that the \nanesthesia level at the time of death was adequate to \nproduce unconsciousness. \ne.  Time from injection of first drug to declaration of death. \nWe generally have to rely on published eyewitness \naccounts or press releases from the various jurisdictions \nfor this information. \n21. In addition to needing the foregoing data about all past Missouri \nexecutions by lethal injection, we would need to know the plans of the \nexecutions in the future execution concerning which our opinion is sought, \nfor example: \n•  identity and training of executioners \n•  number of intravenous (IV) lines \n•  preparation of the chemicals \n•  dosages of the chemicals \n‐ 8 ‐ \n\n•  the order of administration \n•  rate of administration \n•  backup plan \n•  plan, or lack of plan, for monitoring for depth of \nanesthesia \n•  any other fact on which the State relies in contending that \nits plans for carrying out the lethal injection in question \ndoes not create the foreseeable risk of gratuitous pain. \n22.  Each and every one of the foregoing expressions of need for \ncertain data in order to rule out the foreseeable risk of gratuitous pain in a \nMissouri execution by lethal injection is set forth to a reasonable degree of \nscientific certainty. \n‐ 9 ‐ \n\n23.  In the absence of  all of the foregoing information, I am left with \nthe conclusion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the \ninfliction of death by lethal injection on Vernon Brown on May 18,2005,  by \nofficials, officers, and employees of the State of Missouri would create the \nforeseeable risk of  gratuitous pain for the reasons set forth in \"Inadequate \nanesthesia in lethal injection for execution\" in THE LANCET,a s aforesaid. \nFurther, the declarant saith naught. \nI declare under penalty of pe jury that the foregoing is true and \n-<,/p \ncorrect. \n.s/ \nExecuted: \nDepartment of ~nesthesiolo~~ \nSchool of Medicine \nUniversity of Miami \nP.O.
