Plaintiffs contended that suspicionless strip and body cavity searches of detainees accused of misdemeanors and other minor offenses violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages, injunctive relief and class certification.</p><p>The Sheriff and County maintained that the delousing procedure did not constitute a strip search and was nevertheless lawful.  They also contended that the suit was barred by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) and that the Sheriff was protected by the defense of qualified immunity.</p><p>The case was certified as a class action on March 2, 2000, with the class defined as: \"all persons arrested for offenses not greater than a misdemeanor or Operating While Intoxicated, as a class D felony, between January 13, 1997, and January 13, 1999, and who were required by the Floyd County Jail to remove their clothing for visual inspection of all or part of their exposed bodies, unless there existed reasonable cause to believe they were carrying concealed weapons or contraband.\" </p><p>Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  By order dated October 10, 2001, the District Court (Judge Barker) granted plaintiffs' motion, finding that the delousing procedure constituted a strip search and that it violated the Fourth Amendment.  The Court denied defendants' motion was denied, finding that the PLRA did not apply and that the Sheriff was not entitled qualified immunity.  Shortly thereafter, the parties settled the case.</p><p>After a fairness hearing on December 4, 2002, the Court (Judge Barker) formally approved the settlement.    Doan v. Watson, 2002 WL 31730917 (S.D.Ind. Dec 04, 2002) Under the terms of the settlement, the County agreed to pay up to $2,591,000 for settlement of all class claims.  Each class member that participated in the settlement was to receive $1000.00.  It was estimated that there were 2,591 eligible class members.  $700,000 was allocated for attorney's fees, litigation costs and claims administration expenses.  The County actuall</p><p></p>",

Mullineaux, Kightlinger & \nGray, New Albany, IN, Dave Whalin, Landrum & Shouse, Louisville, KY, for Defendants. \nORDER ON CROSS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \nBARKER, District Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on cross motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs, \nMindy Doan, et al. (collectively \"Plaintiffs\"),[1] have filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nalleging that former Floyd County, Indiana Sheriff Leland Watson, individually and in his \nofficial capacity, and current Floyd County, Indiana Sheriff Randall Hubbard, individually \nand in his official capacity (collectively \"Defendants\"), violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights \nby administering improper strip searches. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and Defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment is DENIED. \nFactual Background \nBetween 1997 and 1999, Defendants Leland Watson and Randall Hubbard successively \nserved as Floyd County Sheriff, in which capacity they established and implemented \npolicies at the Floyd County Jail. (Second Amended Compl. ¶ 4.) During that time, several \nindividuals who had been arrested in Floyd County for misdemeanor offenses and \nincarcerated in the Floyd County Jail were subjected to intake searches and delousing \nprocedures before entering the general prison population. (Id. ¶¶ 6-27.) To execute these \nsearches, the prisoner would first be directed to the shower room. (Pl's Statement of \nMaterial Facts, Ex. 3, III.A.) A jail official would instruct the prisoner to remove his or her \nclothing. (Id., Ex. 3, III.B.) Once the prisoner was naked, the Floyd County Corrections \nPolicy for Inmate Searches/Evidence instructed prison officials, \"without touching [the \n\nprisoner], [to] examine their entire body to make certain they are not hiding any contraband \nor weapons on or in their body. Pay particular attention to the mouth, ears, hair, armpits, \ngenital area and anal area. Look between fingers and toes and on the bottom of the feet.\" \n(Id., Ex. 3, III.E.) Following this examination, officials escorted prisoners to the shower \nroom, sprayed prisoners with delousing solution, told the prisoners to shampoo the solution \nin, and then allowed the prisoners to rinse the solution from their bodies. (Pl's Statement of \nMaterial Facts ¶ 5.) Following this procedure, prisoners were to be dressed in orange prison \nuniforms. (Id., Ex. 3, II.E.) In January 1999, Defendant Hubbard enacted a new policy \nregarding admission strip searches, which 934*934 enumerated limited circumstances \nunder which admission strip searches would be permitted. (Id., Ex. 5.) These circumstances \nrelated primarily to a prisoner's prior convictions, the nature of the charged offense, and \nofficers' reasonable suspicion that a prisoner might be hiding weapons or contraband. (Id.) \nStandards of Review \nSummary judgment is appropriate if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" \nFed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact exists if there is sufficient evidence for \na reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the non-moving party on the particular issue. \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 \n(1986). The mere existence of a factual dispute will not bar summary judgment; the facts in \ndispute must be outcome-determinative. Id. In considering a motion for summary judgment, \na court must review the record and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party. Id. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505; Del Raso v. United States, \n244 F.3d 567, 570 (7th Cir. 2001). \"[A] party will be successful in opposing summary \njudgment only when they present definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" Smith \nv. Severn, 129 F.3d 419, 427 (7th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is required only if it is clear \nthat a plaintiff will be unable to satisfy the legal requirements necessary to establish his or \nher case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d \n265 (1986). \nAnalysis \n1. Application of the PLRA \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs' suits are barred by the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\"PLRA\"), which restricts the rights of prisoners to bring federal actions based on mental or \nemotional injury. Plaintiffs respond that the statute applies only to litigants who were \nprisoners at the time their claims were filed. By waiting to file suit until after the completion \nof their detention, the argument follows, Plaintiffs avoid application of the PLRA. The \nrelevant portion of the statute reads, \"No Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner \nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered \nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). \nDefendants argue that the Seventh Circuit has issued contradictory statements as to \nwhether this provision applies to claims by former inmates based on injuries arising during \n\ndetention. Specifically, Defendants contend that the court's decision in Zehner v. Trigg, 133 \nF.3d 459 (7th Cir. 1997) suggests that the PLRA applies to claims by both current and \nformer inmates, so long as the conduct giving rise to the complaint occurred during the \nperiod of incarceration. In Zehner, a group of Indiana state prisoners were allegedly \nexposed to asbestos while working in a prison kitchen. Id. at 460. The class of plaintiffs \nconsisted of \"[a]ll offenders in the custody of the Indiana Department of Corrections who \nwere employed in the `old' kitchen or in the tunnel under the `old' kitchen at the Indiana \nYouth Center ... for a total of thirty days or more after October 14, 1991, through October \n14, 1993.\" Zehner v. Trigg, 952 F.Supp. 1318, 1321 (S.D.Ind.1997). The plaintiffs filed suit \nagainst corrections officials for mental and emotional injuries resulting from the exposure. \nZehner, 133 F.3d at 460. Not all class members remained in custody at the time the \ncomplaint was filed. Zehner, 952 F.Supp. at 1323. The district court dismissed the action \nwithout prejudice, 935*935 concluding that the PLRA must apply to claims arising during \nincarceration when brought by current or former prisoners. Id. at 1327. The Seventh Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal without explicitly revisiting the issue of whether the PLRA applies to \nclaims by former prisoners. Zehner, 133 F.3d at 464. \nDefendant claims that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Zehner creates ambiguity regarding \nthe PLRA's application to former prisoners. The court remedied any such ambiguity, \nhowever, in a lengthy explanation in Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321 (7th Cir.1998). There, \nKerr, a former prisoner claimed that \"brainwashing\" techniques utilized in a prison \nsubstance abuse program violated his constitutional rights. Id. at 322. Kerr filed suit after \nbeing released on parole. Id. The Seventh Circuit found that the PLRA did not apply to \nclaims brought by a former prisoner. Id. at 323. In language directly addressing Defendants' \narguments regarding Zehner, the court stated that its affirmation of the dismissal in Zehner \nwas based not on the application of the PLRA to former prisoners, but \"on other grounds.\" \nId. at 322. \nIn the present case, Defendants attempt to create ambiguity where there is none. The \nSeventh Circuit has clearly held and district courts in this circuit have repeatedly recognized \nthat the PLRA does not apply to claims brought by former inmates. Kerr, 138 F.3d 321; \nGary v. Sheahan, 2000 WL 889785, at *2 (N.D.Ill. June 26, 2000); Doe v. Cook County, \n1999 WL 1069244, at *3 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 22, 1999). Because Plaintiffs filed their claims \nfollowing their detention, the PLRA does not require them to produce evidence of physical \ninjury to pursue their claims. Therefore, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on this \nissue is DENIED. \n2. Constitutionality of the Policy \nPlaintiffs contend that the Floyd County delousing procedure constitutes an unreasonable \nsearch pursuant to the Fourth Amendment.[2] Defendants respond that the delousing \nprocedure does not constitute a \"strip search,\" or, at least, that ambiguity exists regarding \nthe precise definition of a \"strip search.\" In making this argument, however, Defendants \nadvocate a strained interpretation of the term. A search is commonly understood to mean \n\"[a]n examination of a person's body, property, or other area that the person would \nreasonably be expected to consider as private, conducted by a law-enforcement officer for \nthe purpose of finding evidence of a crime,\" whereas a \"strip search\" is specifically \"[a] \nsearch of a person conducted after that person's clothes have been removed, the purpose \n\nbeing to find any contraband the person might be hiding.\" Black's Law Dictionary (7th \ned.1999). The Seventh Circuit has defined a strip search as \"a visual inspection of a naked \ninmate without intrusion into the person's body cavities.\" Peckham v. Wisconsin Dep't of \nCorrections, 141 F.3d 694 (7th Cir.1998). The court has also noted that \"[o]bservation is a \nform of search.\" Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 145 (7th Cir. 1995). \nThe Floyd County Jail intake procedure clearly includes a strip search. The policy \nspecifically instructed officers to inspect prisoners' naked bodies in search of contraband, \npaying particular attention to the genital and anal areas. This directive indicates that officers \nwere intended 936*936 to observe the prisoners. That the policy did not command the \nprisoner to bend over to facilitate the viewing of the named areas does not mitigate the fact \nthat these were unclothed inspections for contraband. Because the delousing procedure \nincluded the essential elements of a strip search, we must apply Fourth Amendment \nanalysis to determine its constitutionality. \nThe Fourth Amendment generally proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. \nConst. amend. IV. This prohibition requires that searches be reasonable under the \ncircumstances. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); U.S. v. \nEdwards, 415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974); United States v. Brown, 64 \nF.3d 1083, 1086 (7th Cir.1995). To determine the reasonableness of a search, such as the \ntype at issue here, courts apply a balancing test defined by the Supreme Court in Wolfish: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case, it requires a balancing of the need for the \nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must \nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \n441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (citations omitted). \"The more intrusive the search, the \ncloser governmental authorities must come to demonstrating probable cause for believing \nthat the search will uncover the objects for which the search is being conducted.\" Mary Beth \nG. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir.1983), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, \n18, n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). \"It is beyond question that a strip search \ninitiated without justification — such as a `blanket strip search policy' — is unconstitutional.\" \nDoe v. Village of Downers Grove, 1992 WL 8720, at *2 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 15, 1992), citing Mary \nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1271-73; Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1219 \n(N.D.Ill.1990); Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wis. 1979), aff'd per curiam, 620 \nF.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980). \nThe Seventh Circuit analyzed the Fourth Amendment implications of similar searches in \nMary Beth G. There, women arrested on misdemeanor charges and awaiting the arrival of \nbail money were subjected to strip searches and inspections of their body cavities by female \nofficers. 723 F.2d at 1266. The searches were conducted on all women detained in city \nlockups, regardless of whether officials had reason to believe they were in possession of \ncontraband. Id. The court observed, \"We can think of few exercises of authority by the state \nthat intrude on the citizen's privacy and dignity as severely as the visual anal and genital \nsearches practiced here.\" Id. at 1272. Balancing the nature of the searches against the \ngovernmental interest in maintaining security and preventing the importation of contraband \n\ninto prison facilities, the Seventh Circuit held that \"the strip searches bore an insubstantial \nrelationship to security needs,\" rendering them unreasonable under Fourth Amendment \nanalysis. Id. at 1273. \nHere, the searches carried out by Defendants closely resemble the searches at issue in \nMary Beth G. Defendants admit that the strip search procedure was applied to all prisoners \nprior to their being released into the prison population. (D's Resp. to Pl's Statement of \nMaterial Facts ¶ 19.) Although Defendants correctly identify their duty to safeguard the \nprison environment, they have not demonstrated any factual basis to relate the blanket strip \nsearch policy to legitimate security interests. 937*937 The delousing procedure \nadministered by Defendants in the Floyd County Jail violates the Fourth Amendment's \nprohibition of unreasonable searches. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment \nis GRANTED on this issue, and Defendants' Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is \nDENIED. \n3. Qualified immunity \nDefendants contend that they should enjoy qualified immunity for their administration of the \nstrip-search procedure, pursuant to § 1983. Qualified immunity is available only to officials \nwith discretionary or policymaking authority when sued in their individual capacities under § \n1983. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. \n163, 166, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993); Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d \n758, 766 (7th Cir.2000). Essentially, this defense is \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face \nthe other burdens of litigation.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 \nL.Ed.2d 411 (1985). Officials acting under qualified immunity are not subjected to suit \n\"unless their actions violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights then known \nto a reasonable officer.\" Ulichny v. Merton Cmty. Sch. Dist., 249 F.3d 686, 706 (7th \nCir.2001). \nThe analysis of a qualified immunity defense requires an ordered, two-step inquiry. First, the \nCourt must determine \"whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts \nalleged.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, ___, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 \n(2001). For this purpose, we examine the facts in the light most favorable to the party \nasserting the injury. Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 \n(1991). On this point, we need not restate our analysis, because we have already \ndetermined that the procedure violated Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. See discussion \nsupra. \n\"[I]f a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties' submissions, the next, \nsequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at \n___, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. This determination must be made in light of the context surrounding \nthe alleged violation. Id. A right may be clearly established \"if it is so obvious that a \nreasonable state actor would know that what they were doing violated the Constitution or if \na closely analogous case establishes that the conduct is unconstitutional.\" Willits v. Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc., 2001 WL 1028482 (S.D.Ind. Aug. 14, 2001), citing Siebert v. Severino, \n256 F.3d 648, 654-55 (7th Cir. 2001). Conversely, if reasonable officials could disagree on \nthe issue, a right is not clearly established. Ulichny, 249 F.3d at 706; Hinnen v. Kelly, 992 \nF.2d 140, 142-43 (7th Cir.1993). \n\nThe closely analogous case of Mary Beth G. provided strong indication that Defendants' \nprocedures were being carried out in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, the \nrevised policy demonstrates that Defendants either had knowledge or reasonably should \nhave been aware of the necessity of probable cause to justify a strip search. Indeed, each \nof the new policy's listed criteria relates in some way to the likelihood that the prisoner will \nbring weapons or contraband into the jail. However, the admission strip searches conducted \nbetween January 1997 and January 1999 were not supported by such explanation, despite \nthe clear need for some individualized justification. Because Plaintiffs have pled sufficient \nfacts to establish a constitutional violation, and because the rights at issue were clearly \nestablished at the time of the alleged violation, Defendants are not shielded by qualified \nimmunity in this matter. Accordingly, 938*938 Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \non this issue is DENIED. \nConclusion \nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. For the reasons stated above 1) the \nPLRA does not bar Plaintiffs' suits; 2) Defendants' strip search procedure violated Plaintiffs' \nFourth Amendment rights; and 3) Defendants are not protected by qualified immunity for \nsuch violations. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Partial Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED \nand Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. \n[1] Plaintiff Doan serves as class representative for a class that includes \"all persons arrested for offenses not greater \nthan a misdemeanor or Operating While Intoxicated, as a class D felony, between January 13, 1997, and January 13, \n1999, and who were required by the Floyd County Jail to remove their clothing for visual inspection of all or part of \ntheir exposed bodies, unless there existed reasonable cause to believe they were carrying concealed weapons or \ncontraband.\" (Entry of Mar. 2, 2000, at 25.) \n[2] Plaintiffs briefly reference the Fourteenth Amendment in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, but they do \nnot provide the Court with even the most basic link between Fourteenth Amendment protections and their claims. \nTherefore, we do not consider these arguments in evaluating the present motion. \n ",
