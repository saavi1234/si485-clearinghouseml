    "summary": "<p>In 1993, Plaintiff, represented by several private attorneys, filed a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, challenging the strip search policies in effect in the jails of Merrimack County, Carroll County, and Strafford County, New Hampshire.  Plaintiff claimed that the challenged policies, which required that all inmates be strip searched upon admission to jail, were unconstitutional.  Plaintiff requested class certification in addition to other relief.</p><p>Our information on this case is limited to the PACER docket and one published opinion.  We do not have copies of pleadings filed with the Court.</p><p>According to the docket, the District Court (Judge Paul J. Barbadoro) certified the case as a class action on September 30, 1996.  The parameters of the class were not set out in the docket entries.  A discovery schedule was set and it appears that the Court ordered that the case proceed in phases, with Phase I presumably dealing with liability issues.</p><p>Strafford County moved for summary judgment, which the Court denied, finding that the County's blanket policy of strip searching all inmates upon admission to the jails was unconstitutional.  Moser v. Anderson, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22637 (D.N.H. Nov. 25, 1996).  The remaining Phase I issues were resolved on April 10, 1998 when Judge Barbadoro granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs.</p><p>Settlement negotiations ensued, with the parties agreeing to mediation.  The case was ultimately settled and the settlement was preliminarily approved by the court on August 20, 1999.  Judge Barbadoro issued a final order approving the settlement on January 14, 2000.  The precise settlement terms are not apparent from the docket, but news accounts reported that the case settled for $3 million.  Claims were paid on an agreed point system.  It was estimated that there were 2,000 class members, 356 of whom made claims for a participation rate of 17.8%.  The Court also awarded 33.3% of the settlement fund for attorney's fees, litigation costs, and claims administration expenses.</p><p>A final report on settlement administration was filed in April 2000 and the case was then closed.</p><p></p>",

LEXIS 22637 \nPamela L. Moser, et al. v. Carole A. Anderson, Administrator \nMerrimack County House of Corrections, et al.  Defendant Strafford County moves for summary judgment in \nplaintiffs'  civil  rights  action  alleging  violations  of  the \nDisposition:  [*1]   Defendants'  motion  for  summary  constitutional  rights  of  detainees [*2]   who  were  strip \njudgment (document no. 70) denied.   searched  at  the  Strafford  County  House  of  Corrections. \nStrafford's  strip-search  policy,  which  began  in  1982  and \nCounsel: For PAMELA L. MOSER, plaintiff: Dort S. Bigg,  continued at least until October 1993, required strip searches \nEsq., Wiggin & Nourie, Manchester, NH.  \"on all inmates at admission\" to the county jail. Strafford \nasserts that its strip- search policy and the strip searches it \nFor PAMELA L. MOSER, plaintiff: Bruce E. Barron, Esq.,  conducted were not unconstitutional. \nBarron Law Office, Salem, NH. \nAnother judge of this court has previously determined that \nFor  PAMELA  L.  MOSER,  plaintiff:  Joseph  L.  Hamilton,  Strafford's  policy  of  strip  searching  protective  custody \nEsq., Hamilton & Caputo, Salem, NH. \ndetainees  without  reasonable  individualized  suspicion  of \nfinding weapons or contraband was unconstitutional.

Supp. 16, 19 (D.N.H. 1993). 1 Most, if not all, \nMeade & Loring, PC, Portsmouth, NH. \njurisdictions that have considered the constitutionality of strip \nsearches have determined that strip searches of arrestees or \nFor  CAROL  ANDERSON,  MERRIMACK  COUNTY, \ndetainees  held  for  minor  offenses  and  without  reasonable \nBONNIE  MCKINNON,  JEFF  CROFT,  COUNTY  OF \nsuspicion  that  the  individual  is  carrying  weapons  or \nCARROLL,  defendants:  William  G.  Scott,  Esq.,  Boynton \ncontraband are unconstitutional. See, e.g., Wachtler v. County \nWaldron Doleac Woodman & Scott, Portsmouth, NH. \nof Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir. 1994); Chapman v. \nNichols,  989  F.2d  393,  395  (10th  Cir.  1993)  (collecting \nFor STRAFFORD COUNTY, NH, defendant: Malcolm R. \ncases), accord Warner v.

Bigg, Esq., Wiggin & Nourie,  922, 929 (1st Cir. 1996)(applying reasonable individualized \nManchester, NH.   suspicion standard to strip searches of prison visitors); United \nStates v.

I  am \npersuaded that these decisions are correct. Therefore, I hold \nOpinion by: Paul Barbadoro  that strip searches of protective custody detainees or arrestees \n  for  minor  offenses  without  reasonable  individualized \nOpinion  suspicion that they may be carrying weapons or contraband \nare unconstitutional. \nORDER \n [*4]  Strafford argues that the strip searches conducted under \nits policy are constitutional because the county  \n  \n1 Kidd v. Gowen appears to be dispositive of Strafford's argument that its strip search policy passes constitutional muster. However, to the \nextent that Kidd might be interpreted narrowly to apply only to a policy set by a directive that has not been raised in this action and not to \nstrip searches that have occurred under a different policy or practice, I now address generally Strafford's policies or practices of strip \nsearching arrestees or detainees held for minor offenses without reasonable individualized suspicion that they might be carrying weapons or \ncontraband. \n  \n\n 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22637, *4  Page 2 of 2 \nrelied on a manual prepared pursuant to a grant from the  does not make the practice legal). 3 Therefore, Strafford's \nUnited States Department of Justice. 2 Even if the manual  argument is unavailing. [*5]  \nrepresented  the  Justice  Department's  interpretation  of \nconstitutionally adequate procedures, it would not be entitled  CONCLUSION \nto deference nor would adherence to the manual make the \ncounty's policy constitutional. See, e.g., Dillard v. City of  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  defendants'  motion  for \nGreensboro, 74 F.3d 230, 235-36 (11th Cir. 1996) (citing and  summary judgment (document no. 70) is denied. \nquoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 115 S. Ct. 2475, \nSO ORDERED. \n2491, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995) (\"we think it inappropriate for \na court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference \nPaul Barbadoro \nto  the  Justice  Department's  interpretation  of  the  [Voting \nRights] Act\")); Kilgore v. Mitchell, 623 F.2d 631, 635 (9th \nUnited States District Judge \nCir. 1980) (reliance on erroneous Justice Department policy \ninterpreting wiretap statute may provide a basis for qualified  November 25, 1996 \nimmunity but  \n  \n2 Robert LeClair states in his affidavit that he drafted Strafford's strip-search policy in 1982 based on the \"Small Jail Resource Manual, \npublished by Rod Miller and Ralph Nichols of Community Resource Services, Inc.\" LeClair further states that he understood that \nCommunity Resource Services received a grant from the Justice Department and the National Institute of Corrections to write the manual. \nStrafford provides no further evidence that the manual expressed the Justice Department's policy or interpretation of the legality of strip \nsearches. \n3 I do not decide the viability of a qualified immunity defense based on a \"good faith\" reliance on the manual as qualified immunity is not \navailable to a municipality or a county and only Strafford has moved for summary judgment. See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics \nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 166, 122 L. Ed. 2d 517, 113 S. Ct. 1160 (1993). \n  ",
