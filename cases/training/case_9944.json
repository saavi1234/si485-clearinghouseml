    "summary": "<p>On  October 31, 2003, a young man (twice strip searched, at ages 16 and 17, after separate misdemeanor and minor violation arrests), represented by private attorneys from several New York firms, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.  He alleged that the Rensselaer County  Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Rensselaer County Jail, including those charged with misdemeanors or petty violations, regardless of the charge and without reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and class certification.  Defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations.</p><p>Shortly after suit was filed, the parties settled the case and a related case, Bruce vs. County of Rensselaer (1:02-CV-847).  Following passage of the periods for notice and claims, Judge Thomas J. McAvoy granted plaintiff's motion for class certification and for final approval of the Agreement.  He entered judgment on September 24, 2004. </p><p>Under the settlement, Rensselaer County agreed to pay up to $2.7 million to settle all class claims, with each class member receiving $1,000.  Claimants would receive the same amount, regardless of gender or the number of strip searches.  The court awarded $442,701.74 for attorney's fees, litigation costs and claims administration expenses. The class representative received an incentive bonus of $5,000.  The eventual participation rate was 27% -- 733 claims having been made (639 class members were paid; 94 disputed claims were being investigated).  Based on the actual payout of $1,175,701.74, the fees, costs and expenses awarded in this case represented 37.65% of the settlement.  </p><p>After the settlement was approved and claims were paid, approximately forty individuals whose claims had been denied by the County as untimely moved to have their claims paid.  The  District Court (Magistrate Judge David R. Homer) determined that some claims notices had been re-mailed to updated address and, thus, ruled that any claims received within 90 days of the latest re-mailing date would be paid.  Kahler v. County of Rensselaer, 2005 WL 1981300 (N.D. N.Y. Aug 17, 2005).</p><p>On June 27, 2007, Judge Homer entered an order terminating the case at plaintiffs' request and without defense objection.  We have no information that subsequent activity occurred in the case.</p><p></p>",

Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \n1 \n\nthe  written  procedures  of the  Rensselaer  County  Sherif:fs  Department,  and  was \npromulgated  by senior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  Sheriff Daniel \nKeating,  Undersheriff Larry Walraed,  Colonel  Robert  Loveridge,  Lieutenant  Harold \nSmith and Rensselaer County Executive Kathleen Jimino. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Rensselaer \nCounty and the Rensselaer County Sherif:fs Department to  force  those  charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  It is also just \nthe latest indication of a County Jail that is mismanaged and where the civil rights of \nthose  who  enter,  even  for  a  brief stay  on  minor  charges,  are  simply  ignored  or \nconsciously trampled upon. \nPaul Kahler brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class \nmembers he proposes to represent.  Mr. Kahler was sent to the Rensselaer County Jail on \ntwo  occasions  during the  class period after being charged with misdemeanor and/or \nviolation offenses, and was subject to a strip search on both occasions, in violation of his \nrights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  He seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed \nclass, a declaration that the Sherif:fs Department's policies are unconstitutional, and an \ninjunction  precluding  Rensselaer  County  and  the  Rensselaer  County  Sherif:fs \n2 \n\nDepartment from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With \nthis as a background, Plaintiff Paul Kahler hereby complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 US.c. \n§  1331,  1341  &  1343  because it  is  filed  to  obtain compensatory damages,  punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nUS.C.  §§  1981  &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 US.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 US.C. § 1391 (e) (2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs'  claims  and  those  of proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Paul Kahler (\"Kahler\") is  19  years  old and resides  in Rensselaer \nCounty.  On or about April 8, 2000, Kahler (then age sixteen) was arrested on charges of \ncriminal mischief in the fourth degree (a misdemeanor) and placed in the custody of the \nRensselaer County Jail.  On or about October 26,2001, Kahler (then age seventeen) was \nagain arrested on charges of assault in the third degree (a misdemeanor) and harassment \nin the second degree (a violation),  and was placed in the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail. \n3 \nI  I! \n\n4.  Defendant  County  of Rensselaer  (the  \"County\")  is  a  county  government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant \nhereto,  the  County,  acting through  its  Sheriffs Department,  was  responsible  for  the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe Rensselaer County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision \nand  conduct  of all  Sheriff s  Department  personnel,  including  those  working  in  the \nRensselaer County Jail.  In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for \nenforcing  the  rules  of the  Rensselaer  County  Jail,  and  for  ensuring  that  Sheriffs \nDepartment personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates and ofthe State of New York. \n5.  The Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department (the \"Sheriffs Department\") is a \nCounty Sheriffs Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New \nYork.  Although not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Department is listed \nas a party for the purposes of identification.  At all times relevant hereto, the Sheriff s \nDepartment was responsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the \nRensselaer  County Jail  (\"RCJ\").  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  Defendant  Sheriffs \nDepartment, together with the County of Rensselaer, was responsible for the polices, \npractices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the RCJ, \nand  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training,  supervision  and  conduct  of all \nSheriffs Department personnel, including those working in the RCJ.  In addition, at all \ntimes  relevant  hereto,  Defendant  Sheriffs Department,  together  with  the  County of \nRensselaer, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Rensselaer County Jail, and for \n4 \nI  I! \n\nensunng  that  Sheriff's  Department  personnel  employed  in  the  RCJ  obeyed  the \nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of New York. \n6.  Defendant Daniel V. Keating (\"Sheriff Keating\") is the duly elected Sheriff of \nRensselaer County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre \ntrial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises custodial or other control.  Sheriff \nKeating's principal place of business is 4000 Main Street, Troy, NY  12180.  Sheriff \nKeating is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities. \n7.  Defendant  Larry  Walraed  (\"Larry  Walraed\")  is  the  duly  appointed \nUndersheriff of Rensselaer County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the \ntreatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises custodial or other \ncontrol.  Larry Walraed's principal place of business is  4000 Main Street, Troy, NY \n12180.  Larry Walraed is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and \nofficial capacities. \n8.  Defendant Robert  Loveridge  (\"Colonel  Loveridge\")  is  the  duly appointed \nColonel of the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department and is the officer in charge of the \noperation of the Rensselaer County Jail.  As such, Colonel Loveridge is a policy maker \nwith respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises \ncustodial or other control.  Colonel Loveridge's principal place of business is 4000 Main \nStreet, Troy, NY  12180.  Colonel Loveridge is made a Defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities. \n9.  Defendant Harold Smith (\"Lieutenant Smith\") is a duly appointed Lieutenant \nin the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department and is the administrative officer for the \nRensselaer County Jail.  Lieutenant Smith is second in command to Colonel Loveridge in \n5 \n\nresponsibility for jail operations.  As such,  Lieutenant Smith is  a policy maker with \nrespect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises \ncustodial or other control.  Lieutenant Smith's principal place of business is 4000 Main \nStreet, Troy, NY  12180.  Lieutenant Smith is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities. \n10. Defendant Kathleen Jimino (\"County Executive Jimino\") is the duly elected \nCounty Executive of Rensselaer County and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to \nthe treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises custodial or \nother control.  County Executive Jimino's principal place of business is the Rensselaer \nCounty Office Building, Seventh Avenue, Troy, NY  12180.  County Executive Jimino is \nmade a Defendant in this action in both her individual and official capacities. \n11. Collectively, Sheriff Keating, Larry Walraed, Colonel Loveridge, Lieutenant \nSmith  and  County  Executive  Jimino  will  be  referred  to  as  the  \"Policy  Making \nDefendants. \" \n6 \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals  who  were  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and  were  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Rensselaer County Jail. \n13. The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons in the United States who have been or will be placed into the \ncustody  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with \nmisdemeanors, violations or other minor crimes and were or will be strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Rensselaer County Jail pursuant to the \npolicy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment and the County of Rensselaer.  The class period commences \non June 26, 1999, and extends to the date on which the Rensselaer County \nSheriff's Department and/or the County of Rensselaer are enjoined from, \nor otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and \ncustom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion. \nSpecifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants, and all of \ntheir  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors, \nemployees or assignees. \n14. This action has been subject to a prior complaint to this Court, filed on June \n26, 2002, where the Court, for scheduling reasons, declined to entertain a motion for class \ncertification.  See,  Bruce v.  County of Rensselaer,  No.  02-CV-0847 (TJMlDRH).  To \ndate, no motion to dismiss the class  action allegations has been raised,  and the class \nallegations themselves have not been stricken from the complaint.  Consequently, the \nclass is defined from June 26, 1999 to present, as the statute oflimitations has been tolled \nby the filing of a prior complaint. \n15. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n7 \n\n16. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail every month -\nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n17. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the  large number of class  members  and the  fact  that  class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Rensselaer County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindi vi dually. \n18. Common questions oflaw and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n19. Plaintiff's claim is typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff \nand all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants'  course of \nconduct.  The hanns suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the hanns suffered by the \nclass members. \n8 \n\n20. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n21. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum \nMenken &  Ben-Asher, LLP; and Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason \nLaw Firm, PLLC.  Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas litigated a wide variety of civil rights actions before this Court, and has litigated class \naction lawsuits in state and federal  courts in five  states.  Mr.  Keach has successfully \nlitigated strip search cases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady \nCity School District, and has previously litigated two other cases against the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriffs Department, including one on behalf of a sixteen year old girl raped by \na Corrections Officer. \n22. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys \nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. \nMenken and Mr.  Rozger have  successfully represented many victims  of illegal  strip \nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the \nCity of New York. \n23. Gary E. Mason is one of this country's premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500  companies in both state  and federal  court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \n9 \n\nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class  actions,  including In Re The Exxon Valdez,  In Re Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  In \naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles \nSchneider is a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights \nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases involving corrections misconduct. \n24. In short, Plaintiffs counsel has the resources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this  action  against Rensselaer County,  the  Rensselaer  County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n25. This action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As  such,  the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County \nJail.  In short, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department, the \nPolicy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections Officers acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n26. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b )(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b )(3). \n27. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \n10 \nI,  'I  I \n\npredominate question of whether the Defendants' de facto policy of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, and whether such a de facto policy existed during the class period. \n28. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to  redress  the wrongs done to  them.  The cost to  the federal  court  system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also  magnify the  delay and  expense to  all  parties  and the  court  system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as  a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n29. Upon information and belief, there are no  other actions (other than Bruce) \npending to address the Defendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of \nindividuals,  even  though  the  Defendants  have  maintained  their  illegal  strip  search \nregimen  for  at  least  the  past  twelve  years,  with  the  practice  being  declared \nunconstitutional in this judicial circuit in 1986. \n30. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n11 \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n31. The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy Making Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they supervise,  from  performing strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors  or other minor crimes  unless  the  officer has  reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n32. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a de facto policy, \ncustom  or practice  of strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  custody  of the \nRensselaer County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged  crime  and  without  the  presence  of reasonable  suspicion to  believe  that  the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n33. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the \nvaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, regardless  of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively \nreferred to as \"strip searches.\" \n34. The County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department, and \nthe Policy Making Defendants  know  that  they may not  institute,  enforce  or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \n12 \n,  I \nI \n\nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).  In fact, this decision was recently cited \nby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in one of many civil rights cases to \nbe successfully prosecuted against the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department.  See, \nSagendorf-Teal  v.  County  of Rensselaer,  100  F.3d  270,  276  (2d  Cir.  1996)  (citing \nWeber). \n35. The Defendants' de facto policy, practice and custom mandating wholesale \nstrip  searches  of  all  misdemeanor  and  violation  arrestees  has  been  promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n36. Upon information and belief, not only is the policy of strip searching illegal, \nbut the manner in which individuals are searched is also impermissible.  For example, \nupon information and belief, individuals are strip searched in the presence of corrections \nofficers, jail employees andlor arrestees ofthe opposite gender. \n37.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, andlor the circumstances of the arrest. \n38. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriff's Department and the Individual Defendants have promulgated,  implemented, \nenforced, andlor failed to rectify a de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching \nall individuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and placed into jail \nclothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any \n13 \nI  ,I  I \n\nsort.  This de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither \nthe nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances \nof a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom \nof routine strip searches. \n39. Pursuant to this de facto policy, each member of the Class, including every \nnamed  Plaintiff,  was  the  victim  of a  routine  strip  search  upon  their  entry into  the \nRensselaer  County  Jail.  These  searches  were  conducted  without  inquiry  into  or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion,  and in fact  were not  supported by reasonable \nSuspICIOn.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n40. The  strip  searches  in  question  largely  occurred  in  an  open  area  of the \nRensselaer County Jail booking room, behind a \"half wall\" near the booking computers \nutilized by RCJ employees.  This open area is in clear view of all six prisoner holding \ncells in the booking room, and can also been seen by Corrections Officers on an elevated \nplatform, from windows in the booking room and from larger holding cells utilized to \nprepare inmates for transport. \n41. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - each member \nof the class, including every named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n42. Additionally, Defendant Daniel Keating, in his capacity as Sheriff and chief \npolicy  maker  for  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail,  together  with  the  Policy  Making \nDefendants, have promulgated a written policy purporting to govern the strip searches of \n14 \n'I \nI \n\nindividuals detained in the Rensselaer County Jail.  This written policy, attached to this \nAmended Complaint as Exhibit A, does not provide that all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Rensselaer County Jail are subject to being strip-searched. \n43. This written policy, however, is not followed in the Rensselaer County Jail, as \nadmitted by Colonel  Loveridge  and Lieutenant James Karam during their deposition \ntestimony.  While some (but not all) correctional employees maintain that strip searches \nwere based on reasonable suspicion, proof taken in this  action demonstrates that the \nRensselaer County Jail employs a de facto policy, as set forth above, that provides that all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and placed into jail \nclothing are subj ect to a strip-search. \n44. Additionally,  the  Defendants  claim  that  they  provided  training  to  their \nsubordinates about various policies relative to strip-searching, including the need for a \nsupervisor to approve of a strip-search and make a written report, the use of an unwritten \n\"clothing change\" policy, and the requirement that reasonable suspicion be present when \nconducting a strip search.  Discovery in this action has shown, however, that there has \nbeen absolutely no substantive training about booking procedures or strip searches during \nthe class period,  or even since the  commencement of this  action.  COs  received no \ntraining whatsoever relative to the circumstances under which they could conduct a strip \nsearch, and instead learned procedures by observing other officers in the booking room. \n45. Nevertheless, the written policy promulgated by Defendant Keating and the \nPolicy Making Defendants is, on its face, unconstitutional. \n15 \n\n46. The  written  policy  provides  that  strip-searches  may  be  conducted  on \nindividuals arrested for misdemeanors and violations without requiring particularized, \nreasonable suspicion that those individuals are concealing contraband or a weapon. \n47. The  written  policy provides  that  anyone  charged with  a  crime  involving \nviolence  or drugs  is  subject to  a  strip  search,  even in the  absence  of particularized \nreasonable suspicion. \n48. The written policy also  states that anyone who  appears  in the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail that is under the influence of alcohol or drugs (in the SUbjective opinion of \nthe search officer) is subject to a strip search regardless of the nature of their criminal \ncharges and in the absence of particularized reasonable suspicion. \n49. The written policy further provides that anyone  arrested  for  the  following \noffenses,  even  in  the  absence  of particularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  are \npossessing contraband or a weapon, is subject to a strip search:  Sexual Misconduct (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Imprisonment  (A  Misdemeanor);  Resisting  Arrest  (A \nMisdemeanor); Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Seventh Degree (A \nMisdemeanor);  Criminally  Using  Drug  Paraphernalia  in  the  Second  Degree  (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Possession  of Marijuana  (Violation);  Disorderly  Conduct \n(Violation);  Harassment  in  the  First  Degree  (B  Misdemeanor);  Public  Drunkenness \n(Violation);  Unlawfully  Dealing  with  Fireworks  and  Dangerous  Fireworks  (B \nMisdemeanor); Unlawful Possession of Weapons by Persons Under Sixteen (Juvenile \nOffense);  Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Fourth Degree (A Misdemeanor); \nInciting a Riot (A Misdemeanor); Riot in the Second Degree (A Misdemeanor); Killing \nor Injuring a Police Animal (A Misdemeanor); and Self Abortion (A Misdemeanor). \n16 \nI  I \n\n50. This written policy also provides that someone who has ever been charged \nwith  a  \"strip-searchable\" offense  may,  if later  arrested  for  a non  \"strip  searchable\" \ncharge, be strip searched without the necessity of particularized, reasonable suspicion. \nThese individuals are termed \"permanently strip searchable\" in the policy. \n51. The written policy does not state that strip searches will only be performed by \nmembers of the same gender as the accused, and does not state that individuals of the \nopposite gender should not be present during the search. \n52. The written policy is, for these reasons, unconstitutional on its face. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \nPaul Kahler \n53. Mr. Kahler's experience is representative.  On or about April 8,  2000, Mr. \nKahler was charged with Criminal Mischief in the Fourth Degree, a misdemeanor, for \nallegedly punching a wall.  Mr. Kahler subsequently resolved these charges by pleading \nguilty and receiving probation.  Mr. Kahler is presently 19 years old.  He was taken into \ncustody by the East Greenbush Police Department.  Mr.  Kahler's transporting officer \ninformed the booking staff at RCJ that Mr. Kahler was \"real [sic] cooperative.\" \n54. Subsequent to his arrest, Mr. Kahler was transported to the Rensselaer County \nJail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Kahler was moved into the shower area (behind the half wall) \nof the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  This area is visible from \nevery holding cell, as well as from much of the booking room.  As Corrections Officers \nwatched, Mr. Kahler was ordered to, and did, remove his clothing.  Mr. Kahler objected \nto having to remove his clothing, and was told to \"just do it.\" \n17 \nI'  I  I \n\n55.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Kahler to \"face the wall,\" and told \nhim to \"squat.\"  The officer instructed Mr.  Kahler to  \"lift your sack\" to  allow for an \nexamination  underneath  his  scrotum.  After  the  completion  of the  examination,  the \nCorrections Officer made disparaging comments to Mr.  Kahler about the color of his \nunderpants. \n56. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Kahler was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nofMr. Kahler that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, \nbecause Mr. Kahler had already been in custody of police officers from the Town of East \nGreenbush, the Corrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. \nKahler had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed \nany weapons or contraband. \n57. On or about October 26, 2001, Mr. Kahler was charged with Assault in the \nThird Degree, a misdemeanor, and Harassment in the Second Degree, a violation,  for \nallegedly getting in a fist fight with his brother.  These charges were later dismissed.  Mr. \nKahler was taken into custody by the East Greenbush Police Department. \n58. Subsequent to his arrest, Mr. Kahler was transported to the Rensselaer County \nJ ail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Kahler was moved into the shower area (behind the half wall) \nof the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  As Corrections Officers \nwatched, Mr. Kahler was ordered to, and did, remove his clothing.  Mr. Kahler was then \ntold to tum around and \"squat.\" \n18 \n\n59. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Kahler was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Mr. Kahler that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, \nbecause Mr. Kahler had already been in custody of police officers from the Town of East \nGreenbush, the Corrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. \nKahler had already been sUbjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed \nany weapons or contraband. \n60.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Kahler has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n19 \n!'  !  I \n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n61. Plaintiff incorporates by reference  and realleges  each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 60. \n62. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches by law  enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n63. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff's rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Rensselaer \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to  order/direct Rensselaer  County Corrections  Officers  to \nconduct such searches. \n64. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Rensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department.  As such, \nthe County of Rensselaer is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n65. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Keating,  Larry  Walraed,  Colonel \nLoveridge,  Lieutenant  Smith  and  County  Executive  Jimino  are  responsible  for \n20 \n,  I  I \n\nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Rensselaer \nCounty  Jail,  and  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of the  strip  search  policy \nquestioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Keating, Walraed, Loveridge, Smith and Jimino are \neach individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass. \n66. Sheriff Keating,  Larry Walraed,  Colonel Loveridge,  Lieutenant  Smith and \nCounty Executive Jimino knew that the RCJ's strip search policy was illegal, and acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n67. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 US.c. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n68. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \n21 \nI  I \nI \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n69. Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 68. \n70. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment,  the  County of Rensselaer and the  Policy Making Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n71. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Rensselaer and the \nRensselaer County Sheriff's Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n72. Plaintiffs  incorporate by reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 71. \n73. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment,  the  County of Rensselaer  and the  Policy Making Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \n22 \nI  I  I \n\nparticularized  SuspIcIOn  that  the  individuals  III  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n74. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n75. The  continuing  pattern  of strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n76. Plaintiff demands  that  the  County  of Rensselaer,  the  Rensselaer  County \nSheriffs Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe Rensselaer County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n23 \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n77.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n78. The conduct of the Individual Defendants herein represents just the  latest \nexample of a County Jail and Sheriffs Department that is completely mismanaged.  In \nrecent years, the Jail has come under scrutiny for a series of incidents  involving the \nexcessive use of force against inmates (where the County and the Sheriffs Department \ninevitably blames the inmates for \"injuring\" themselves), the rape of a juvenile inmate by \na Corrections Officer, deliberate indifference to those with psychological problems, and \nthe illegal termination of a Corrections Officer who detailed the application of excessive \nforce in an administrative report.  The Sheriff s Department has also recently been sued \nfor firing,  and prosecuting on felony charges, one of its own deputies for supposedly \nmisusing a sick day. \n79. It is clear that the Individual Defendants, the County of Rensselaer and the \nRensselaer County Sheriffs Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto punish the Individual Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements \nof the  United  States  Constitution  also  apply  to  government  officials  in  Rensselaer \nCounty. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n80. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n24 \n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Paul Kahler, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a \nclass  of others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  him  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff's First \nand Fourth Causes of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by \na Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A judgment against Defendant Daniel Keating on Plaintiff's First and Fourth \nCauses of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.

A  declaratory  judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  County  of \nRensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department's policy, practice and custom \nof strip and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Rensselaer County Jail, \n25 \n,  ! \n\nregardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and \nImproper. \nr.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  ellJommg  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nJ.

These actions were commenced on June 26, 2002 and October 31, 2003, as class \nactions. \n2.  After intensive litigation between the parties in these related actions, and several months \nof intensive, arm's-length negotiations between Class Counsel and Defendants, the parties have \nreached accord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class \nMembers, in return for a release and dism issal of the claims at issue in this case against the \nDefendants (\"Settlement Agreement\").  The resulting Settlem ent Agreement was preliminarily \napproved by the Court on April 28, 2004. \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed \nNotice Program and Class Notice, which provided members of the Settlement Class notice of this \nproposed settlement with Defendants.  The No tice Program provided an opportunity for class \nmembers to file objections to the Settlement. \n4.  The settling Parties have f iled with the  Court a declaration f rom Kinsella/Novak \nCommunications, Ltd., declaring that the mailing of the Court-approved Notice, consistent with the \n                                                 \n1 Capitalized terms used in this Order have the meaning assigned to them in the Settlement Agreement, Order of \nPreliminary Approval of Settlement, Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action and this Order. \n  2\n\nNotice Program, has been completed.  \n5.  The Court finds that the published, direct notice and Internet posting constitute the best \npracticable notice of the Fairness Hearing, the porposed Settlement, Class Counsel's application for \nfees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice and the Summary Notice; and that \nsuch notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members of the Settlement Class, and \ncomplied fully with the requirem ents of Rule 23  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nConstitution of the United States, the laws of New York and any other applicable law.   \n6.  Any persons who wished to excluded from this Settlement were provided an opportunity \nto “opt out” pursuant to the Notice.  All persons who have validly excluded themselves from this \nAction have no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound by the Settlement \nAgreement or the final judgment herein.  \n7.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement, the Settlement Agreement and \nreleases contained therein, and the Final Orde r and Judgment, and do not have any further \nopportunity to opt-out of the Action. \n8.  Any Class member who did not tim ely file and serve an objection in writing to the \nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counsel's application \nfor fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with  the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and \nmandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any \nsuch objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n9.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the Settlem ent \nAgreement, the Court is of  the opinion that th e Settlement is a f air, reasonable and adequate \ncompromise of the claims against the Defendants in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  There are a number of factors which the Court has considered in affirming \n  3\n\nthis Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested.  \nb.  The Court notes that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the benefit of \nproviding relief to members of the class now, without further litigation, under circumstances where \nthe liability issues are still vigorously contested among the parties to this litigation. This Settlement \nprovides Settlement Class Members with a substantial benefit, which might not have been available \nwere this litigation to continue. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct  of hard-fought litigation between the \nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the par otf Class Counsel or Counsel for the Defendants. \n10. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their application for \nreasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs, and expenses consistent with the term s  of  the Settlem ent \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n11. The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a simplified \nprocess and workable.  In any event, the Court will retain jurisdiction to work out any unantiipcated \nproblems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT AND \nTHE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: \n \n  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n12. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n13. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement \nClass is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into  the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail during the period June 26, 1999, through and including \nJuly 1, 2002, after being charged w ith misdemeanors, violations, \nviolations of probation or parole, traffic infractions or civil court \n  4\n\ncommitments and were strip searched upon their entry into the Jail.  \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all \nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees.   \n \n14. The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an appropriate method \nfor resolving the disputes in this litigation.  All the prerequisites for Class certification under Rule 23 \nare present.  The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined.  Questions of law \nand fact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and should be determined \nin one proceeding with respect to all Class members.  The Class Representatives’ claims are typical \nof those of the Class. The class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating \nand resolving this action.   \n15. Settlement Class Representatives are entitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of \n$66,000, over and above their respective proceeds undert he Settlement Agreement and as set forth \nin the Settlement Agreement, in recognition of the efforts they have undertaken and the risk they \nhave incurred in connection with this Action. \n16. The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, including the distribution \nof the proceeds of the settlement, as being fair, reasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n17. The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT AND \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS \nFOLLOWS: \n \n18. The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED.   \n19. Settlement Class Representatives are entitled to and are hereby awarded an additional \n  5\n\npayment of $66,000 over and above their claims for damages, in accordance with the Settlement \nAgreement, in recognition of the efforts they  have undertaken and the risk they incurred in \nconnection with this Action. \n20. The Class Counsel’s application for attorneys’ fees and expenses is granted. \n21. These Actions and all claims against the Defendants are hereby dismissed with prejudice, \nbut the Court shall retain exclusive and continui ng jurisdiction of the Actions, all Parties, and \nSettlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions and obligations of this \nSettlement Agreement. \n22. All Class members who have not timely filed a Request For Exclusion are barred and \nenjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any settled claim or action against the Defendants. \nAny Class member who has not timely filed a Reques Ft or Exclusion is enjoined from initiating any \naction, or continuing to prosecute any filed action, in any forum.  \n  This the ____ day of _________________, 2004. \n \n \n \n             \nThe Honorable Thomas J.

For the reasons which follow, both the motion and \ncross-motion are granted in part and denied in part. \n2 \n\nI. Background \nPlaintiffs commenced the two above captioned class actions alleging that class \nmembers had been subjected to strip searches at the Rensselaer County Correctional \nFacility between June 26, 1999 and July 1, 2002 without reasonable cause following their \narrests on misdemeanor charges.  The cases were settled in March 2004 in an agreement \nsubsequently approved by the district court.  Kahler Docket Nos. 7, 26, 27.  The agreement \nrequired the County in principal part to pay class members $1,000 each plus incentive \npayments to class representatives, attorney's fees, and costs up to a maximum total \nexpenditure of $2,700,000.  Settlement Agreement (Kahler Docket No.7, Ex. 3) [hereinafter \n\"Agreement'1 at 1111 1(11), III(C)(1). \nThe Agreement required in pertinent part a period for notice of the settlement to \npotential claims and a period of sixty days from the \"Notice Date\" for the submission of \nclaims.

The \"Notice Date\" which \ncommenced the claims period was defined as \"the date upon which Class Notice is mailed \nto known Class Members in accordance with the terms herein.\"  JQ. at 1l1(S). \nClass notice was initially mailed to known class members at their last known \n11 \naddresses on April 30, 2004.  Ness Aff. (Kahler Docket No. 17, Ex. B) at  9.  Nearly half of \n11 \nthe 2,632 mailings were returned as undeliverable.  JQ. at  11.  Through various sources of \ninformation, including additional information provided by the County, plaintiffs obtained \nupdated address information on these known class members and re-mailed class notice to \n3 \n\nthem at these updated addresses.  lil at 1M111-15; Pis. Reply Letter-Brief (Bruce Docket \nNo. 112) at 1-2.  It appears that such re-mailings continued as new addresses were found \nuntil approximately August 1, 2004.  Ness Aff. at 111111-15; Pis. Reply Letter-Brief at 1-2. \nFollowing the periods for notice and claims, the district court granted plaintiffs' motion \nfor class certification and for final approval of the Agreement (Kahler Docket No. 26), and \nentered judgment thereon on September 24,2004.  Kahler Docket No. 27.  The final order \n\"barred and enjoined\" any action for recovery by any class member who had failed to file a \ntimely response to the class notice.  Kahler Docket No. 26 at 1111 4, 5.  Thereafter, plaintiffs \nadvised that approximately forty individuals had submitted claims for damages after July 29, \n2004, the date ninety days after the initial mailing of the class notice to known class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs submitted these claims to the County for payment pursuant to the \nAgreement.  The County declined payment on the ground that the claims were untimely. \nThese motions followed.1 \nII. Discussion \n\"Settlement agreements are contracts and must therefore be construed according to \ngeneral principles of contract law.\"  Torres v. Walker, 356 F.3d 238, 245 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(quoting Red Ball Interior Demolition Corp. v. Palmadessa, 173 F.3d 238, 245 (2d Cir. \n1999)); Dahingo v. Royal Caribbean Cruises. Ltd., 312 F. Supp. 2d 440, 445 (S.D.N.Y. \n2004) (Francis, M.J.).  As a contract, its terms to which the parties have agreed should not \nlThese motions have been submitted to the undersigned pursuant to paragraphs \nX(N) and I(P) of the Agreement, which provide that any disputes regarding the Agreement \nshall be submitted to and resolved by the undersigned, whose decision shall be \"final and \nbinding.\" \n4 \n\nthereafter be altered by a court.  Dahingo, 312 F. Supp. 2d at 445-46.  However, in the \ncircumstances of a class settlement, a court may vary the terms of a settlement agreement \nfor equitable considerations where (1) the total cost to a defendant will not be increased, or \n(2) the term to be varied was established in the first instance by the court rather than by the \nparties.  l.d.,. at 446. \nHere, the issue presented concerns the closing date for class members to file claims. \nIt is clear from the Agreement that if claims filed after the closing date agreed between the \nparties is permitted, the cost to the County will be increased.  As noted above, the \nAgreement provided for the County to pay to plaintiffs the total of $1,000 for each approved \nclaim, incentive payments to class representatives, costs, and attorneys' fees with the total \nnot to exceed $2,700,000.  Thus, the total cost to the County depends in part on the \nnumber of claims allowed.  Allowing the claims at issue here would necessarily increase the \ncost to the County by $1,000 for each such claim.  Accordingly, the first exception which \nwould permit the Court to vary the terms of the Agreement is inapplicable here. \nAs to the second, plaintiffs contend that as the ninety-day period for claims was \nincluded in the district court's preliminary approval order, that date was established by the \nCourt and not by the parties.  However, the parties' submissions on this motion \ndemonstrate otherwise.  The extension of the claims period from the sixty days set forth in \nthe Agreement, Agreement at ~ I(B), to the ninety days established in the preliminary \napproval order, Kahler Docket No. 12 at ~ 9, was negotiated and agreed between the \nparties and then incorporated in the preliminary approval order submitted by plaintiffs and \nsigned by the district court.  See Pis. Reply Letter-Brief at 1 (acknowledging that the parties \nprovided the district court with \"input\" on the claims period); Defs. Reply Letter-Brief at 1-2 & \n5 \n\nattachs. (referring to electronic mail communications between the parties establishing the \nparties' agreement to extend the claims period from sixty to ninety days and to the \nproposed preliminary approval order being submitted by plaintiffs).  Therefore, the duration \nof the claims period was a term of the Agreement negotiated between the parties rather \nthan set by the district court and the second exception is likewise inapplicable. \nThe parties' motions thus require interpretation of the Agreement under contract \nprinciples rather than an equitable determination of the appropriate closing date for the \nclaims period.  According to the Agreement, the ninety-day \"Claims Period\" commenced to \nrun on the \"Notice Date.\"  Agreement at ~ 1(8).  As quoted above, the \"Notice Date\" was \n\"the date upon which Class Notice is mailed to known Class Members in accordance with \nthe terms herein.\"  kL. at ~ 1(8).  As to such mailings, the Agreement further provides that \n\"[n]otice will be provided to the Class by direct mailing of Class Notice and a Claim Form to \nall individuals at their last known or readily ascertainable address ....\"  kL. at ~ IV(8)(1) \n(emphasis added).  The \"Notice Date\" triggering the ninety-day claims period thus \ndepended on when a notice was mailed to a class member's \"last known address.\" \nThe record demonstrates that mailings to last known addresses of class members \nbegan on April 30, 2004 with the mailings to the then last known addresses of the 2,632 \nknown class members.  Ness Aff. at ~ 9.  The County contends that this mailing constituted \nthe \"Notice Date\" and that the claims period ended ninety days later, or July 29, 2004.  If \nthis construction is accepted, the approximately forty claims at issue herein were properly \nrejected as untimely. \nIt appears uncontradicted from the record that 1,287 of the April 30, 2004 mailings \nwere returned as undeliverable.  Ness Aff. at ~ 11.  Plaintiffs thereafter made substantial \n6 \n\nefforts to obtain more current addresses for the returned mailings, including obtaining \nfurther information from the County.  kL. at ~~ 12-14; Pis. Reply Letter-Brief at 1-2.  Those \nefforts provided updated addresses for an unspecified number of the returned mailings and, \nbetween April 30 and approximately August 1,2004, notices were re-mailed to such \nupdated addresses.  Ness Aff. at W12-14.  Thus, it appears that the \"last known address\" \nfor many of the class members was not fixed in time on April 30, 2004 but, rather, was a \nrolling process for an unspecified number as more current last known addresses were \nobtained and notices were re-mailed. \nUnder the Agreement, there is no dispute that the claims period commenced on the \n\"Notice Date\" of April 30, 2004 for the 1,345 class members for whom the notice was not \nreturned as undeliverable as well as for any then unknown class members.  For those \nindividuals, the claims period ended on July 29, 2004.  As to those among the remaining \n1,287 to whom notices were re-mailed to updated addresses, the mailing to their last known \naddress which constituted their \"Notice date\" occurred with the latest re-mailing.  For those \nclass members, the claims period ended ninety days after such latest re-mailing and any \nclaim received from such a class member may not be rejected as untimely. \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is hereby \nORDERED that the parties' motion and cross-motion are GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part as follows: \n7 \n\n1. If a claim was received from an individual to whom plaintiffs re-mailed \nnotice to an updated address obtained after April 30, 2004, such claim was timely filed and \nshall be accepted by the County if the claim was received within ninety days of the date on \nwhich the latest re-mailing was made; \n2. All other claims received after July 29, 2004 were properly rejected by the \nCounty; and \n3. As to any claims received after July 29, 2004, plaintiffs bear the burden of \ndemonstrating that (a) an address different from that used for the April 30,2004 mailing \nwas obtained after April 30, 2004; (b) notice was re-mailed to such updated address; and \n(c) the claim was received within ninety days of the date on which the latest re-mailing of \nthe notice was made. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED:  AV!j vst  .17,2005 \nAlbany, New York \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n8 ",

For at least the past thirteen years, the Rensselaer \n1 \n\nCounty Sheriffs Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Rensselaer County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe  written  procedures  of the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs  Department,  and  was \npromulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  Sheriff Daniel \nKeating,  Undersheriff Larry  Walraed,  Colonel  Robert  Loveridge,  Lieutenant  Harold \nSmith and Rensselaer County Executive Kathleen Jimino. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Rensselaer \nCounty and the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department to  force  those charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  It is also just \nthe latest indication of a County Jail that is mismanaged and where the civil rights of \nthose  who  enter,  even  for  a  brief stay  on  minor  charges,  are  simply  ignored  or \nconsciously trampled upon. \nNathaniel Bruce, Mark La Belle, T'Shad Bradley, Natika Miller, Peter Rupp, \nWayne Conine, Jeffrey Rockefeller, William Garrity, Harold Bonesteel, Charles Linen \nand Dana Halloran bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class \nmembers they propose to represent.  All eleven of these individuals were charged with \nmisdemeanor and/or violation offenses, and all eleven were subject to strip searches, in \n2 \n\nviolation of their right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited  States  Constitution.  They  seek  monetary damages  for  themselves  and  each \nmember of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriffs Department's policies are \nunconstitutional, and an injunction precluding  Rensselaer County and the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriffs Department from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into \ntheir custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs Nathaniel Bruce, Mark La Belle, \nT'Shad Bradley, Natika Miller, Peter Rupp, Wayne Conine, Jeffrey Rockefeller, William \nGarrity, Harold Bonesteel, Charles Linen and Dana Halloran complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \nI.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  §§  1981  &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs' claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial \ndistrict. \n\nPARTIES \n3.

Defendant County of Rensselaer (the \"County\") is a county government \norganized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.  At all times relevant \nhereto,  the  County,  acting  through its  Sheriffs Department, was responsible  for  the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \nthe Rensselaer County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision \nand  conduct  of all  Sheriffs  Department  personnel,  including  those  working  in  the \nRensselaer County Jail.

Collectively,  Sheriff  Keating,  Larry  Walraed,  Colonel  Loveridge, \nLieutenant Smith and County Executive Jimino will be referred to as the \"Policy Making \nDefendants.\" \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n22.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(l),  23(b)(2)  and \n23(b )(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Rensselaer County Jail. \n23.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who  were  placed  into  the  custody  of the \nRensselaer County Jail during the period June 26,  1999, \nthrough  and  including July  1,  2002,  after being charged \nwith misdemeanors, violations, violations of probation or \nparole, traffic infractions, or civil commitments and were \nstrip searched upon their entry into the JaiL  Specifically \nexcluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of \ntheir  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n24.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction  under  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n25.  The  members  of the  class  are  so  numerous  as  to  render  joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for \nmisdemeanors and violations who are placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County \nJail every month- all of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information \nand belief, the size of the proposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom \nhave had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n26.  Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of all  of these  individuals  is \nimpracticable  because of the  large number of class  members  and the  fact  that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \n10 \n\npresently residing outside of Rensselaer County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n27.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n28.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages  arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n29.  The representative  Plaintiffs have the  requisite personal interest  in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n30.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  has  substantial  experience  and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs \nare being represented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of \nBerenbaum Menken & Ben-Asher, LLP; and Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of \nThe Mason Law Firm, PLLC.  Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action \nattorney who has litigated a wide variety of civil rights actions before this Court, and has \n11 \n\nlitigated class action lawsuits in state and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has \nsuccessfully litigated strip search cases against the Troy City Police Department and the \nSchenectady City School District, and has previously litigated two other cases against the \nRensselaer County Sheriffs Department, including one on behalf of a sixteen year old \ngirl raped by a Corrections Officer. \n31.  Bruce  Menken  and  Jason  Rozger  are  both  experienced  civil  rights \nattorneys from New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a \nnumber of Defendants,  including one prison brutality case presently pending in this \nDistrict.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger have successfully represented many victims of \nillegal strip searches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation \nagainst the City of New York. \n32.  Gary E. Mason is one of this country's premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million doHars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions,  including In Re The Exxon Valdez,  In Re Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  In \naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles \nSchneider is a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights \nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases involving corrections misconduct. \n33.  In short, Plaintiffs' counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this  action  against  Rensselaer County,  the Rensselaer County \n12 \n\nSheriff's Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n34.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiffs' seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County \nJail.  In short, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department, the \nPolicy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections Officers acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n35.  In addition to  certification under Rule 23(b)(2),  and in the  alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n36.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' de facto policy of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, and whether such a de facto policy existed during the class period. \n37.  A class  action  is  superior to  other available methods  for  the  fair  and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden \nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of \n13 \n\nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also  magnify the delay and  expense to  all  parties  and  the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n38.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address \nthe Defendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even \nthough the Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the \npast twelve years, with the practice being declared unconstitutional in this judicial circuit \nin 1986. \n39.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R  Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n14 \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n40.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors  or other minor crimes  unless  the  officer has  reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n41.  Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe Rensselaer County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of \ntheir charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n42.  Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriffs Department and the  Policy Making Defendants have  instituted a de \nfacto  policy,  custom  or  practice  of conducting  visual  body  cavity  searches  (visual \ninspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe Rensselaer County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of \ntheir charged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n43.  The County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department, \nand the Policy Making Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \n15 \n\nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).  In fact, this decision was recently cited \nby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in one of many civil rights cases to \nbe  successfully prosecuted against the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department.  See, \nSagendorf-Teal  v.  County  of Rensselaer,  100  F.3d  270,  276  (2d  Cir.  1996)  (citing \nWeber). \n44.  The  Defendants'  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom  mandating \nwholesale  strip  searches  of  all  misdemeanor  and  violation  arrestees  has  been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n45.  Upon  information and  belief, not only is  the  policy of strip  searching \nillegal, but the manner in  which individuals are searched is  also impermissible.  For \nexample, upon information and belief, individuals are strip searched in the presence of \ncorrections officers, jail employees and/or arrestees of the opposite gender. \n46.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from \nthe particular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as  the nature of the crime \ncharged, the particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the \narrest. \n47.  Upon information and belief,  the  County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer \nCounty  Sheriffs  Department  and  the  Individual  Defendants  have  promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a de facto policy, practice or custom of \n16 \n\nstrip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and \nplaced into jail clothing without  any requirement of reasonable  suspicion,  or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees \nroutine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor \nthe circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, \npractice and custom of routine strip searches. \n48.  Pursuant to this de facto policy, each member ofthe Class, including every \nnamed  Plaintiff,  was  the  victim  of a  routine  strip  search  upon  their  entry  into  the \nRensselaer  County  JaiL  These  searches  were  conducted  without  inquiry  into  or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion,  and  in fact  were  not  supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n49.  The strip searches in question largely occurred  in an open  area of the \nRensselaer County Jail booking room, behind a \"half wall\" near the booking computers \nutilized by RCJ employees.  This open area is in clear view of all six prisoner holding \ncells in the booking room, and can also been seen by Corrections Officers on an elevated \nplatform, from windows in the booking room and from larger holding cells utilized to \nprepare inmates for transport. \n50.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - each member \nof the class, including every named Plaintiff- has suffered or will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n17 \n\n51.  Additionally,  Defendant Daniel  Keating, in his capacity as  Sheriff and \nchief policy maker for  the  Rensselaer County Jail,  together with the  Policy Making \nDefendants, have promulgated a written policy purporting to govern the strip searches of \nindividuals detained in the Rensselaer County Jail.  This written policy, attached to this \nAmended Complaint as Exhibit A, does not provide that all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Rensselaer County Jail are subject to being strip-searched. \n52.  This written policy, however, is not followed in the Rensselaer County \nJail,  as  admitted  by  Colonel  Loveridge  and  Lieutenant  James  Karam  during  their \ndeposition testimony.  While some (but not all) correctional employees maintain that strip \nsearches were based on reasonable suspicion, proof taken in this action demonstrates that \nthe Rensselaer County Jail employs a de facto policy, as set forth above, that provides \nthat all individuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and placed into \njail clothing are subject to a strip-search. \n53.  Additionally,  the Defendants claim that they provided training to  their \nsubordinates about various policies relative to strip-searching, including the need for a \nsupervisor to approve of a strip-search and make a written report, the use of an unwritten \n\"clothing change\" policy, and the requirement that reasonable suspicion be present when \nconducting a strip search.  Discovery in this action has shown, however, that there has \nbeen absolutely no substantive training about booking procedures or strip searches during \nthe  class period, or even since the commencement of this  action.  COs received no \ntraining whatsoever relative to the circumstances under which they could conduct a strip \nsearch, and instead learned procedures by observing other officers in the booking room. \n18 \n\n54.  Nevertheless, the written policy promulgated by Defendant Keating and \nthe Policy Making Defendants is, on its face, unconstitutional. \n55.  The  written  policy provides  that  strip-searches  may  be  conducted  on \nindividuals arrested for misdemeanors and violations without requiring particularized, \nreasonable suspicion that those individuals are concealing contraband or a weapon. \n56.  The written policy provides that anyone charged with a crime involving \nviolence or drugs  is  subject to  a strip  search,  even in  the  absence of particularized \nreasonable suspicion. \n57.  The written policy also states that anyone who appears in the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail that is under the influence of alcohol or drugs (in the subjective opinion of \nthe search officer) is subject to a strip search regardless of the nature of their criminal \ncharges and in the absence of particularized reasonable suspicion. \n58.  The written policy further provides that anyone arrested for the following \noffenses,  even  in  the  absence  of particularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  are \npossessing contraband or a weapon, is subject to a strip search:  Sexual Misconduct (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Imprisonment  (A  Misdemeanor);  Resisting  Arrest  (A \nMisdemeanor); Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Seventh Degree (A \nMisdemeanor);  Criminally  Using  Drug  Paraphernalia  in  the  Second  Degree  (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Possession  of Marijuana  (Violation);  Disorderly  Conduct \n(Violation);  Harassment  in  the  First  Degree  (B  Misdemeanor);  Public  Drunkenness \n(Violation);  Unlawfully  Dealing  with  Fireworks  and  Dangerous  Fireworks  (B \nMisdemeanor); Unlawful Possession of Weapons by Persons Under Sixteen (Juvenile \nOffense);  Criminal Possession of a Weapon  in the Fourth Degree (A  Misdemeanor); \n19 \n\nInciting a Riot (A Misdemeanor); Riot in the Second Degree (A Misdemeanor); Killing \nor Injuring a Police Animal (A Misdemeanor); and Self Abortion (A Misdemeanor). \n59.  This written policy also provides that someone who has ever been charged \nwith  a \"strip-searchable\" offense may,  if later  arrested  for  a non \"strip  searchable\" \ncharge, be strip searched without the necessity of particularized, reasonable suspicion. \nThese individuals are termed \"permanently strip searchable\" in the policy. \n60.  The written policy does not state that strip searches will only be performed \nby members of the same gender as the accused, and does not state that individuals of the \nopposite gender should not be present during the search. \n61.  The written policy is, for these reasons, unconstitutional on its face. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \nA.  Nathaniel Bruce \n62.  Mr.  Bruce's experience  is representative.  On  or about  November  11, \n2001, Mr.  Bruce was charged with Assault in the Third Degree and Endangering the \nWelfare of a Child, both misdemeanors.  Mr. Bruce subsequently resolved these charges \nby pleading guilty to harassment, a violation.  Mr. Bruce is presently 31  years old.  He \nwas taken into custody by the Troy Police Department. \n63.  At  approximately  12:00  PM  on  November  11,  2001,  Mr.  Bruce  was \ntransported to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Bruce was moved into a \ndepressed  area  in  the  RCJ  booking room  and  ordered  to  remove  his  clothing.  As \nCorrections Officers watched, Mr. Bruce removed his clothing. \n64.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Bruce to tum his back to them, \nlower his underpants and touch his toes.  When Mr.  Bruce was unable to bend over \n20 \n\nbecause of a back injury, he was instructed to \"pull your butt cheeks apart and wiggle.\" A \nCorrections Officer then conducted a visual inspection of Mr. Bruce's rectal cavity. \n65.  On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat Mr. Bruce was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was \nmade of Mr.  Bruce that could have  given rise to  the requisite reasonable  suspicion. \nMoreover, because Mr. Bruce had already been in the custody of police officers from the \nCity of Troy, the Corrections Officers in question knew or should have known that Mr. \nBruce had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed \nany weapons or contraband. \n66.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Bruce has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nB.  Mark La Belle \n67.  Mr. La Belle's experience is representative as well.  On or about April 14, \n2001, Mr. La Belle was charged with Driving While Intoxicated, a misdemeanor under \nNew York's Vehicle and Traffic Law.  Mr. La Bene subsequently resolved these charges \nby pleading guilty to Driving While Ability Impaired, a traffic violation.  Mr. La Belle is \npresently 32 years old.  Mr.  La Belle was taken into custody by the New York State \nPolice. \n68.  At  approximately  6:00  AM  on  April  14,  2001,  Mr.  La  Belle  was \ntransported to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. La Belle was moved into \n21 \n\nthe shower area in the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  As a \nCorrections Officer watched, Mr. La Belle removed his clothing. \n69.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. La Belle to tum his back to him, \nlower  his  underpants  and  touch  his  toes.  Mr.  La  Belle  complied,  and  Corrections \nOfficers then conducted a visual inspection ofMr. La Belle's rectal cavity. \n70.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion to  believe  that  Mr.  La  Belle  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. La Belle \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. \n71.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. La Belle \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nC.  T'Shad Bradley \n72.  Mr. Bradley's experience is representative as well.  On or about April 29, \n2000,  Mr.  Bradley  was  charged  with  Trespassing,  a  misdemeanor.  Mr.  Bradley \nsubsequently resolved these charges by pleading guilty to trespassing.  Mr. Bradley is \npresently 19 years old, and was sixteen at the time of his arrest.  Mr. Bradley had never \nbeen arrested prior to this trip to the RCJ.  Mr. Bradley was taken into custody by the \nTroy Police Department. \n73.  At  approximately 11:00 PM on the day of his arrest, Mr.  Bradley was \ntransported to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Bradley was moved into \nthe shower area in the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  As a \nCorrections Officer watched, Mr. Bradley removed his clothing.  The Corrections Officer \n22 \n\nin question instructed Mr.  Bradley to  remove  each piece  of clothing while standing \ndirectly in front of him, including his underpants. \n74.  The Corrections Officer then instructed Mr.  Bradley to turn his back to \nhim and \"squat\".  Mr. Bradley complied while the Corrections Officer stood above him. \n75.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Mr.  Bradley  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Bradley \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Mr. \nBradley had already been in the custody of police officers from the City of Troy, the \nCorrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. Bradley had already \nbeen subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n76.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Bradley \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nD.  Natika Miller \n77.  Ms. Miller's experience is representative as well.  On or about April 29, \n2000, Ms. Miller was charged with Resisting Arrest, a misdemeanor, and Obstruction of \nGovernmental  Administration  in  the  Second  Degree,  a  misdemeanor.  Ms.  Miller \nsubsequently resolved these charges by accepting an adjournment in contemplation of \ndismissal.  Ms. Miller is presently 19 years old, and was seventeen at the time of her \narrest.  Ms. Miller had never been arrested prior to this trip to the RCJ.  Ms. Miller was \ntaken into custody by the Troy Police Department. \n\n78.  At approximately  11 :00  PM on the  day of her arrest,  Ms.  Miller was \ntransported to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Ms. Miller was moved into a \ncomer in  the  RCJ  booking  room  and  ordered  to  remove  her clothing  by  a  female \nCorrections Officer.  Ms. Miller was forced to do this while in the same room with male \narrestees and male Corrections Officers.  As a Corrections Officer watched, Ms. Miller \nremoved her clothing.  The Corrections Officer in question  instructed  Ms.  Miller to \nremove  each piece of clothing while  standing directly in front  of her,  including her \nunderpants and bra. \n79.  After removing her bra, the Corrections Officer instructed Ms. Miller to \nlift her breasts for  an  inspection of the  skin on the  bottom part of the  breast.  The \nCorrections Officer then instructed Ms. Miller to tum her back to her and touch her toes. \nMs.  Miller  complied  while  the  Corrections  Officer  stood  behind  her  and  visually \nexamined Ms. Miller's vaginal and rectal cavities. \n80.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Ms.  Miller  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Ms. Miller \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. Moreover, because Ms. \nMiller had already been in the custody of police officers  from  the  City of Troy, the \nCorrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Ms. Miller had already \nbeen subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n81.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Ms. Miller has \n\nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nE.  Peter Rupp \n82.  Mr. Rupp's experience is representative as well.  Mr. Rupp was arrested \non or about June 22, 2000 and was charged with Reckless Endangerment in the Second \nDegree (a misdemeanor).  After arraignment, Mr. Rupp was transported to the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail.  Shortly thereafter,  Mr.  Rupp  was  ordered  by a Corrections  Officer to \ndisrobe, and to bend over and touch his toes.  This was done in the RCJ booking room \nwhile in the presence of a female corrections officer. \n83.  Mr. Rupp was a Corporal on active duty in the United States Marine Corps \nat the time of his incident. \n84.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Mr.  Rupp  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Rupp that \ncould have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Mr. Rupp \nhad already been in the custody of police officers from the City of Troy, the Corrections \nOfficer  in  question  knew  or  should  have  known  that  Mr.  Rupp  had  already  been \nsubjected  to  a  search  incident  to  arrest  that  would  have  revealed  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n85.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Rupp has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n\nF.  Wayne Conine \n86.  Mr.  Conine's  experience  is  representative  as  well.  Mr.  Conine  was \narrested on or about March 29, 2002 and was charged with Criminal Possession of a \nWeapon in the Fourth Degree (a misdemeanor), Resisting Arrest (a misdemeanor) and \nDisorderly Conduct (a violation). \n87.  At  approximately 10:00 AM on the day of his arrest, Mr.  Conine was \ntransported to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Conine was ordered, in \nthe presence of a female Corrections Officer, to remove his clothing.  In response to his \ncomplaints relative to  the presence of a female  officer,  Mr.  Conine was  told  that  it \n(meaning his naked body) was nothing she had not \"seen before.\"  Mr. Conine complied \nby removing his clothing,  and was also instructed to bend over,  lift his genitals and \nspread the lobes of his buttocks.  No contraband was found on Conine's person. \n88.  Approximately six hours later, Mr. Conine posted bail and was released. \n89.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Mr.  Conine  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Conine \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. Moreover, because Mr. \nConine had already been in the custody of police officers from the City of Troy, the \nCorrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. Conine had already \nbeen subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n90.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr.  Conine \n\nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nG.  Jeffrey Rockefeller \n91.  Mr. Rockefeller's experience is representative as well.  Mr.  Rockefeller \nwas arrested on or about May 4, 2000 on charges of Criminal Contempt in the Second \nDegree  (a misdemeanor)  and  Harassment in the  Second Degree (a violation).  After \narraignment, Mr. Rockefeller was subject to a $500.00 bail and was transported to the \nRensselaer  County  Jail.  Shortly  after  arrival,  Mr.  Rockefeller  was  ordered  by  a \nCorrections Officer to remove all of his clothing.  Mr. Rockefeller complied and was then \nordered to  squat down,  lift his genitals  and  ''wiggle\" his buttocks.  The Corrections \nOfficer  then  examined  Mr.  Rockefeller's  anus  with  a  flashlight,  and  then  told  Mr. \nRockefeller that \"you got a pencil dick there buddy.\"  The officer then laughed in Mr. \nRockefeller's presence. \n92.  This search took place in view of other inmates and female Corrections \nOfficers. \n93.  All charges pending against Mr. Rockefeller where later dismissed. \n94.  There was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr.  Rockefeller was \nconcealing  a  weapon  or  other  contraband.  Indeed,  no  inquiry  was  made  of Mr. \nRockefeller that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion. Moreover, \nbecause Mr. Dolan had already been in the custody of police officers from the City of \nTroy,  the  Corrections  Officer  in  question  knew  or  should  have  known  that  Mr. \nRockefeller had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have \nrevealed any weapons or contraband. \n27 \n\n95.  Mr. Rockefeller has also been incarcerated in the Rensselaer County Jail \nseveral other times during the class period, and was subject to a strip search on each and \nevery occasiOn. \n96.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant  to  County  and  Sheriffs  Department  policy,  practice  and  custom,  Mr. \nRockefeller  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer  psychological  pain,  humiliation, \nsuffering and mental anguish. \nH.  William Garrity \n97.  Mr.  Garrity's  experience  is  representative  as  welL  Mr.  Garrity  was \narrested on January 5,  2002 and was charged with Resisting Arrest (a misdemeanor), \nDriving While Intoxicated (a misdemeanor), Refusal of a Breath Test (a traffic violation), \nand Speeding (a traffic infraction). \n98.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Garrity was transported to the Rensselaer County \nJaiL  Mr. Garrity was ordered, in the presence of a female Corrections Officer, to remove \nhis clothing.  Specifically, Mr. Garrity was taken behind the \"half wall\" in the shower \narea ofthe booking room and ordered to take off all ofhis clothing.  He was then ordered \nto bend forward and \"spread [his] cheeks.\"  During his discussions with the Corrections \nOfficer who conducted the search, Garrity was told that \"you have no rights in here.\" \nImmediately before being searched, Mr.  Garrity watched as another detainee was strip \nsearched in the shower area over that person's verbal objections. \n99.  Mr. Garrity was subsequently bailed out after spending only a few hours \nin the Rensselaer County Jail. \n28 \n\n100.  Mr. Garrity is the son of a retired New York State Police Captain, and is a \nlicensed physical therapist. \n101.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Mr.  Garrity  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Garrity \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Mr. \nGarrity had already been in the custody of police officers from  the City of Troy, the \nCorrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. Garrity had already \nbeen subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n102.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr.  Garrity \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n/. Charles Linen \n103.  Mr. Linen's experience is representative as well.  Mr. Linen was arrested \non or about May 15, 2002 and was charged with Criminal  Contempt in the Second \nDegree  (a  misdemeanor)  and  Non-Support  of a  Child  (a  misdemeanor).  After \narraignment,  Linen  was  transported  to  the  Rensselaer County Jail.  Linen  was  then \nordered to remove all of his clothing and place it on the top of the \"half wall\" in the \nshower area of the booking room.  Mr.  Linen complied and was ordered to touch his \nankles, lift his genitals, and spread the lobes of his buttocks.  When Mr. Linen objected to \nthis procedure and informed the Corrections Officer that he was only in for child support, \nthe officer responded that it \"doesn't matter.\"  This Officer also told Mr. Linen that if he \n29 \n\ndid not like being strip searched, \"stop coming to jail.\" No contraband was found on Mr. \nLinen's person. \n104.  Mr. Linen was strip searched in the presence of female inmates housed in \nthe holding cells. \n10 5.  Mr. Linen was bailed out of the RCJ the following day. \n106.  There  was  no  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Mr.  Linen  was \nconcealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. Linen that \ncould have  given rise  to  the  requisite suspicion.  Moreover,  because Mr.  Linen had \nalready been in  the  custody of police  officers  from  the New  York  State Police,  the \nCorrections Officers in question knew or should have known that Mr. Linen had already \nbeen subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed any weapons or \ncontraband. \n10 7.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Linen has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nJ.

Moreover, because Mr. Bonesteel \nhad already been in the custody of police officers from the City of Troy, the Corrections \nOfficers in question knew or should have known that Mr. Bonesteel had already been \nsubjected  to  a  search  incident  to  arrest  that  would  have  revealed  any  weapons  or \ncontraband. \n110.  As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Bonesteel \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nK.  Dana Halloran \n111.  Ms. Halloran's experience is representative as well, and  is all the more \ncompelling given that she was arrested after the filing of this action.  Ms. Halloran was \narrested on or about December 7, 2002 and was charged with Criminal Contempt in the \nSecond Degree (a misdemeanor) and Violation of an Order of Protection (a violation). \nMs.  Halloran  subsequently  resolved  her  charges  by  accepting  an  Adjournment  in \nContemplation of Dismissal.  Ms. Halloran is a 22 year old college student and pharmacy \nemployee, and had never been arrested prior to her being sent to the Rensselaer County \nJail. \n112.  After Ms.  Halloran was transported to the Rensselaer County Jail from \nTroy, she was processed for booking and walked through a metal detector.  She was then \nmoved from the booking room to the former Court Ready room across the hall, where she \n31 \n\nwas ordered into a room and told to remove her clothing by a female corrections officer. \nWhen Ms. Halloran attempted to retain her underpants and bra when changing into the \njail uniform, she was forced to take off both by the Corrections Officer standing by the \ndoor.  Specifically,  the  Corrections  Officer  told  her  to  remove  both  her  bra  and \nunderpants while watching her from behind.  There was a mirror present against the far \nwall, allowing this Corrections Officers to observe Ms. Halloran's naked body from the \nfront, as well. \n113.  Approximately two hours after entering the Rensselaer County Jail, Ms. \nHalloran posted bail and was released. \n114.

Indeed, no inquiry was made of Ms. Halloran \nthat could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, because Ms. \nHalloran had already been in the custody of police officers from the City of Troy, the \nCorrections  Officer in question knew  or  should have known that Ms.  Halloran had \nalready been  subjected  to  a  search  incident  to  arrest  that  would  have  revealed  any \nweapons or contraband. \n115.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 115. \n117.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches  by law  enforcement officers,  and  prohibits officers  from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n118.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nRensselaer County  Corrections  Officers  to  strip  search  Plaintiffs  and  class  members \nbased on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was  also not objectively \nreasonable  for  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct  Rensselaer  County \nCorrections Officers to conduct such searches. \n119.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to  the policy, custom or \npractice of the County of Rensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department. \nAs  such,  the  County of Rensselaer is  directly liable  for  the  damages  of the  named \nPlaintiffs and members ofthe Class. \n120.  Upon information and belief,  Sheriff Keating,  Larry Walraed,  Colonel \nLoveridge,  Lieutenant  Smith  and  County  Executive  Jimino  are  responsible  for \n33 \n\nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Rensselaer \nCounty  Jail,  and  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of the  strip  search  policy \nquestioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Keating, Walraed, Loveridge, Smith and Jimino are \neach individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass. \n121.  Sheriff Keating, Larry Walraed, Colonel Loveridge, Lieutenant Smith and \nCounty Executive Jimino knew that the RCJ's strip search policy was illegal, and acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n122.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n123.  As  a direct and proximate result of the  unconstitutional acts  described \nabove, Plaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n--Demand for Declaratory Judgment -\n124.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 123. \n125.  The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the  County of Rensselaer and the  Policy Making  Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n126.  Plaintiffs  and  members  of the  Class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment,  and  that  it  declare  the  strip  search  policy  of the  County  of \nRensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n127.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 126. \n128.  The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment,  the  County of Rensselaer and the  Policy Making Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \n35 \n\nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  m  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n129.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nRensselaer  County  Jail,  with  new  and/or  prospective  members  of the  Class  being \nsubjected to the harms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs. \n130.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n131.  Plaintiffs demand that the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriffs Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe Rensselaer County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n36 \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n132.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, \nin that they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for \na fact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n133.  The conduct of the Individual Defendants herein represents just the latest \nexample of a County Jail and Sheriff's Department that is completely mismanaged.  In \nrecent years, the Jail has come under scrutiny for a series of incidents involving the \nexcessive use of force against inmates (where the County and the Sheriff's Department \ninevitably blames the inmates for \"injuring\" themselves), the rape of a juvenile inmate by \na Corrections Officer, deliberate indifference to those with psychological problems, and \nthe illegal termination of a Corrections Officer who detailed the application of excessive \nforce in an administrative report.  The Sheriff's Department has also recently been sued \nfor  firing,  and prosecuting on felony charges, one of its own deputies for supposedly \nmisusing a sick day. \n134.  It is clear that the Individual Defendants, the County of Rensselaer and the \nRensselaer County Sheriff's Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto punish the Individual Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements \nof the  United  States  Constitution  also  apply  to  government  officials  in  Rensselaer \nCounty. \nDEMANDFORTIDALBYJURY \n135.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n37 \n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  Nathaniel  Bruce,  Mark  La  Belle,  T'Shad  Bradley, \nNatika Miller,  Charles Linen,  Peter Rupp, Jeffrey Rockefeller,  Wayne Conine,  Dana \nHalloran, William Garrity and Harold Bonesteel, on behalf of themselves and on behalf \nof a class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against  all  Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs'  First and \nFourth  Causes  of Action  detailed  herein,  awarding Compensatory Damages  to  each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by \na Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A judgment against Defendant Daniel Keating on Plaintiffs' First and Fourth Causes \nof Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A judgment against Defendant Larry Walraed on Plaintiffs' First and Fourth Causes \nof Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nE.

A judgment against Defendant Hal Smith on Plaintiffs' First and Fourth Causes of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nG.  A judgment against Defendant Kathleen Jimino on Plaintiffs' First and Fourth Causes \nof Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nH.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Rensselaer \nand the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department's policy, practice and custom of strip \n38 \n\nand visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Rensselaer County Jail, regardless \nof the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nI.  A preliminary and  permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from  continuing to \nstrip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes \nabsent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the search is \nconcealing weapons or other contraband. \nJ.

It Is Not From A Lawyer.  You Are Not Being Sued. \nThis is a proposed settlement of a class action alleging that corrections officers and others \nemployed  at  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  engaged  in  the  practice  of illegally  strip \nsearching all individuals charged with only misdemeanors or minor offenses upon their \nentry into  the  Rensselaer County Jail  from  June  26,  1999  until  July  1,  2002.  The \nproposed settlement does not include individuals that were charged with felony offenses \nat the time of their admission to the Rensselaer County Jail. \nThe primary benefit of the settlement to class members is the payment of $1,000.00 to \neach member of class provided the funds allotted for the settlement are not exhausted.  If \nthe number of claims at $1,000.00 per person exhausts the money available for such \npurposes from the Settlement Fund, than every class member will receive their pro rata \nshare of the fund. \nThe settlement requires the defendants to:  (1) establish a Settlement Fund in an amount \nnot to exceed $2,700,000 to pay all costs, expenses and payments to class members; (2) \nagree to a court order that prohibits Rensselaer County from conducting strip searches on \nnew detainees brought to the Rensselaer County Jail on misdemeanor or minor criminal \ncharges absent reasonable suspicion that the are hiding contraband on their persons; (3) \npay, on behalf of the class, plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and litigation costs in an amount to \nbe determined by the Court; (4) pay incentive awards to the class representatives; and (5) \npay all of the costs of notifying the class about, and administering all aspects of, this \nsettlement, including distributing payment to members of the class. \nVisit the  Settlement website at www.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com for additional \ndetails about the settlement.  You may also get additional information by calling 1-800-, \nor by writing to: \n1 \n\nRensselaer County Jail Civil Rights Class Action Administrator \nP.D.Box \nYour legal rights are affected whether you act or don't act.  Read this notice carefully. \nYOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OPTIONS IN THIS SETTLEMENT: \nSubmit a Claim Form  You must submit a claim form to receive payment under the \nsettlement.  You must submit a claim for by \nto be included in the settlement. \nExclude Yourself  If you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will not be \nbound by the Settlement or judgment and will not be \nentitled to a cash payment.  You will be free to pursue your \nclaims against the Defendants.  This is the only option that \nallows you ever to bring or be part of any other lawsuit \nagainst the defendants in this case about the same legal \nclaims as are advanced in this case.  You must exclude \n. \nyourself from the Settlement by \nObject  If you do not exclude yourself, you may write to the Court \nabout why you do not like the Settlement or the request for \nlegal fees and costs.  You must file an objection by \n. \nGo to a Hearing  You may ask to speak in Court about the fairness of the \nsettlement or the request for fees and costs. \nDo Nothing  You get !!.2 payment. You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \nThese rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in this \nnotice. \nThe Court in charge ofthis case still has to decide whether to give final approval to the \nSettlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if the Court \ngrants final approval to the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved. \nBASIC INFORMATION \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou or someone in your family may have entered the Rensselaer County Jail on misdemeanor or \n2 \n\nother minor charges from June 26, 1999 until July 1,2002 and been subject to a strip search. \nThe Court sent you this notice because you have a right to know about a proposed settlement of a \nclass action, and about your options, before the Court decides whether to approve the settlement. \nIf the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed \nby the Court will make the payments that the settlement allows.  You will be informed of the \nprogress of the settlement. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, \nwho is eligible for them, and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nNew York, United States Senior District Court Judge Thomas J. McAvoy presiding, and the \ncases involved are know as Bruce v. County ofR  ensselaer, Case No. 02-CV-0847 and Kahler v. \nCounty ofR  ensselaer, Case No. 03-CV- 1324.  The people who sued are called Plaintiffs, and the \nmunicipality and municipal officials they sued, the County of Rensselaer, its Correctional \nemployees and elected officials, are called the Defendants. \nII. WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nThe lawsuit claimed that the County of Rensselaer illegally strip searched individuals \nadmitted to the Rensselaer County Jail who were charged with only misdemeanors and other \nminor crimes, in violation of the unreasonable search provisions contained in the United States \nConstitution.  Defendants deny they did anything wrong, and further claim that the bulk of class \nmembers are not entitled to any money as a result of being searched. \nIII.  WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Nathaniel \nBruce, Mark LaBelle, T'Shad Bradley, Natika Miller, William Garrity, Charles Linen, Wayne \nConine, Harold Bonesteel, Jeffrey Rockefeller, Peter Rupp and Paul Kahler), sue on behalf of all \npeople who have similar claims.  All these people are a Class or Class Members.  One Court \nresolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the \nClass.  United States Senior District Judge Thomas McAvoy is in charge ofthis class action. \nIV.  WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Instead, both sides agreed \nto a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will \nget compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the settlement is best for \neveryone who was alleged to have been illegally searched. \n3 \n\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge McAvoy decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:  All \npersons who were placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail during the period June \n26, 1999, through and including July 1,2002, after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \ntraffic violations, violations of probation or parole or civil commitments and were strip searched \nupon their entry into the Jail.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nThe Settlement does not cover individuals charged with felony offenses at the time of \ntheir entry into the Rensselaer County Jail. \nVI.  DO  I  NEED  TO PROVE  I  WAS  STRIP-SEARCHED, AND  WHAT DOES \nTHAT MEAN? \nNo,  you do not need to prove you were subjected to such a search.  In filling out the \nclaim  form,  you  will  affirm,  under  penalty  of perjury,  that  you  were  strip  searched,  and \nDefendants will accept this affirmation.  Provided that your name is detailed in booking records \nmaintained by Rensselaer County, your affirmation will entitle you to payment.  If your name is \nnot  contained  in  Rensselaer  County's  records,  you  may  be  asked  to  provide  additional \ndocumentation before being allowed to participate in the settlement. \nA strip search occurred when you were ordered to take off some or all of your clothes by \na Rensselaer County employee, with that employee watching you undress or forcing  you to \nundress out in the open.  Some members of the class may also have been forced to bend at the \nwaist or manipulate body parts to allow for a visual inspection.  The bulk of Rensselaer County's \nsearches occurred in the shower area of the booking room behind a \"half wall.\"  If you were \nsearched in this matter when first booked into the facility, you are a member of the class and \nentitled to make a claim.  You will need to provide an affirmation on the claim form. \nVII.  I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED AFTER RECEIVING A VISIT AND ALSO WHEN \nRETURNING  FROM  COURT  WHEN  I  WAS  IN  THE  RENSSELAER \nCOUNTY JAIL.  DOES THIS MEAN I CAN ALSO MAKE A CLAIM? \nNo.  Searches of this type are permissible.  You can only make a claim if you were \nsubjected to such a search when you first entered the facility; meaning when your picture and \nfingerprints were taken and you received the jail uniform. \n4 \n\nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS CHARGED \nUPON  ADMISSION  TO THE  RENSSELAER COUNTY JAIL  QUALIFIES  ME  FOR \nINCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \nNew York law creates three distinct categories of offenses:  Felonies, Misdemeanors and \nViolations.  Felonies are the most serious crimes, and are usually punishable by incarceration in \nstate  prison.  Felony  offenses  are  usually  handled  by  a  County  Court  Judge,  and  require \nindictment by a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are examples of felony offenses.  Anyone \ncharged with a felony upon admission to the Rensselaer County Jail, even if they were also \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations at the same time, is not a member of the class unless \nthey were, on another occasion, admitted to RCJ solely on misdemeanor or violation charges. \nMisdemeanors are minor crimes, and are, at most, subject to incarceration in a local jail. \nMisdemeanor offenses are handled by a City, Town or Village Court Judge, and do not require \nindictment.  Assault in the Third Degree, Petty Larceny and Unlawful Possession of Fireworks \nare examples of misdemeanor offenses.  Anyone charged with a misdemeanor on their admission \nto the Rensselaer County Jail is a member ofthe class. \nViolations  are  minor  infractions,  and  are  not  considered  criminal  conduct.  While \nviolations can result in brief incarceration in a local jail, they are generally resolved with a fine. \nViolations are handled by a City, Town or Village Court Judge, and do not require indictment. \nDisorderly conduct, Unlawful Possession of Marijuana, traffic violations and city code violations \nare  examples  of violations.  Anyone  charged  with  a  violation  on  their  admission  to  the \nRensselaer County Jail is a member of the class. \nThe class further allows for individuals to make claims if they were admitted to  the \nRensselaer County Jail for violating the terms of their probation or parole, or ifthey were subject \nto a civil commitment.  Probation or parole is often provided as a condition of release following \na criminal conviction.  Parole is only assessed if an individual has served time in state prison.  If \nan individual was charged solely for violating parole or probation, for instance, not honoring \ntheir conditions of supervision or violating curfew, they are considered to be a member of the \nclass.  If  an  individual  was  charged  with  violating  probation  or  parole  and  also \ncontemporaneously charged with misdemeanors, they are also a member of the class.  If an \nindividual was charged with violating probation or parole and also contemporaneously charged \nwith a felony, they are not a member of the class.  A civil commitment is an order from a non \ncriminal court, usually the Family Court, committing an individual to the Rensselaer County JaiL \nIndividuals  admitted  to  the  Rensselaer  County Jail  on  a  civil  commitment,  for  example,  a \ncommitment for failure to pay child support, are members of the class. \nIX.  I  WAS  ADMITTED  TO  THE  RENSSELAER  COUNTY  JAIL  BUT  CANNOT \nREMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I FIND THIS \nOUT,  AND  HOW  DO  I  KNOW  IF  THE  CHARGE  WAS  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR \nVIOLATION? \n5 \n\nThere a several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of their criminal \ncharges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should reflect both your actual \ncharges and whether the charges were a misdemeanor or violation.  For instance, the criminal \ncomplaint filed against you may state \"Assault in the Third Degree,\" a \"Class A Misdemeanor,\" \nor something similar for each separate charge.  If you do not have your charging documents and \nremember the local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will also be able to help \nyou find these documents. \nIf you need additional help in determining whether you are a class member, or if you \nhave other questions, you can contact the settlement administrator at 1-800- , as they \nmay be able to help you directly or have class counsel call you to answer your questions. \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you believe \nyou are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY RIGHT TO \nPARTIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you were admitted to the Rensselaer County Jail solely on misdemeanor or other minor \ncharges, as defined above, you can participate in the settlement regardless of how you resolved \nyour criminal charges.  Even if you pled guilty to a crime, you may still recover just like any \nother class member. \nXI.  WHAT  IF  I  WAS  ADMITTED  TO  THE  RENSSELAER  COUNTY  JAIL  ON \nMORE  THAN  ONE  OCCASION?  CAN  I  STILL  PARTICIPATE  IN  THE \nSETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Rensselaer County Jail on more than one \noccasion during the class period are members of the class and can recover money.  They can only \nrecover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided with extra payments if \nadmitted to the RCJ more than one time. \nXII.  I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \nIf you are still not sure whether you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call 1-\n800- and the settlement administrator or class counsel may help answer your questions.  For \nmore information, you can also visit the website, www.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com.  Or \nyou can fill out and return the claim form described on page _, in question _, to see if you \nqualify. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET \nXIII.  WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \n6 \n\nDefendants have agreed to provide a settlement fund amount of$2.7 million to \ncompensate Class Members who have been illegally strip searched, and have agreed to alter their \nsearch policies for new detainees to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Defendants have also agreed to \npay for attorneys' fees and expenses, up to a maximum of $580,000, and provide incentive \nawards for the eleven class representatives up to a maximum amount of $72,000.  Defendants \nhave also agreed to pay all the expenses of notifying the class about, and administering all \naspects of, this Settlement, and delivering payments to class members.  Attorneys' fees, \nadministration costs and incentive awards are taken out of the settlement fund amount.  A \ncomplete description of the settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement and Release. \nYou can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement and Release by visiting \nwww.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com. or by calling 1-800-. \nXIV.  WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nThe settlement provides that all class members who make claims will receive a payment \nof up to $1,000.00, depending on the number of valid claims that are made. \nIf you have any liens in place from the Rensselaer County Department of Social Services, \nRensselaer County has agreed to waive those liens as it relates to payments from this settlement. \nXV.  WHAT IFI WAS STRIP-SEARCHED AFTER JULY 1, 2002? \nIf you were strip searched after July 1, 2002, you are not a member of this class action \nand are not entitled to a settlement payment.  You are not bound by this settlement for those \nclaims.  This means you can pursue your claims separately from this settlement with your own \nlawyer. \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \nXVI.  HOW CAN I GET A PAYMENT? \nMUST \nTo qualify for payment, you  send in a claim form.  A claim form is attached \nto this Notice.  You can also get a claim form on the Internet at \nwww.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com.  Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, sign \nit, and mail it postmarked no later than  , 2004. \nYou may be asked for additional documentation, and will be contacted in writing. \nXVII.  WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on  , 2004 to decide whether to approve the \nsettlement.  If Judge McAvoy approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals.  You will \nonly receive payment after these appeals are completed.  It is always uncertain whether these \nappeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year.  Everyone \nwho sends in a claim form will be informed ofthe progress ofthe settlement.  Please be patient. \n7 \n\nXVIII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE CLASS? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you can't sue, \ncontinue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Rensselaer County, its employees, or its \nelected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all ofthe Court's orders \nwill apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim form, you will agree to release all \nclaims that you have related to your having been strip searched. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue \nor continue to sue Rensselaer County, on your own, about the legal issues in this case, then you \nmust take steps to get out of the settlement.  This is called excluding yourself - or is sometimes \nreferred to as \"opting out\" of the Settlement Class. \nXIX.  HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying that you \nwant to be excluded from Bruce v. County ofR  ensselaer and Kahler v.  County ofR  ensselaer.  Be \nsure to include your name, address, telephone number and your signature.  You must mail your \nexclusion request postmarked no later than  , 2004, to: \nRensselaer County Jail Exclusions \nYou can't exclude yourself on the phone or bye-mail.  If you ask to be excluded, you \nwill not get any settlement payment, and you cannot object to the settlement.  You will not be \nlegally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit.  You may be able to sue (or continue to \nsue) Rensselaer County in the future. \nXX.

Index No. 02-CV-0847 \n(TJM/DRH) \nTHE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER, et. aI., \nDefendants. \nPAUL KAHLER, both individually \nand on behalf of a class of others \nsimilarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Index No. 03-CV-1324 \n(TJMIDRH) \nTHE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER, et. ai., \nDefendants. \n[PROPOSED] ORDER FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF \nSETTLEMENT; AND JUDGMENT, FINAL ORDER AND DECREE \nTHIS  CAUSE  commg  on  for  hearing  before  the  undersigned  Judge  on \n________,   2004  pursuant  to  this  Court's  Preliminary  Approval  Order  of \n______ , in order for this Court to conduct a final Fairness Hearing to determine whether \nthe proposed Settlement with Defendants the County of Rensselaer, Daniel Keating, Larry Walraed, \nRobert Loveridge, Harold Smith, and Kathleen Jimino (hereafter \"Defendants\") is fair, reasonable \n\nand  adequate,  and  the  Settlement  Class  Members  being  represented  by Class  Counsel  and \nDefendants being represented by its attorneys; \nAND THE COURT having read and considered the Settlement Agreement, including the \nNotice Program described therein, and Memoranda submitted by Class Counsel, having received \nevidence at the hearing, having heard arguments from Class Counsel and the Defendants, and having \nconsidered the submissions by Class members, and being further advised in the premises, now makes \nthe following Order: \nFINDINGS OF FACTI \n1.  These actions were commenced on June 26, 2002 and October 31, 2003, as class actions. \n2.  After intensive litigation between the parties in these related actions, and several months \nof intensive, arm's-length negotiations between Class Counsel and Defendants, the parties have \nreached accord with respect to a Settlement that provides substantial benefits to Settlement Class \nMembers, in return for a release and dismissal of the claims at issue in this case against the \nDefendants (\"Settlement Agreement\").  The resulting Settlement Agreement was preliminarily \napproved by the Court on ______  \n3.  As part of the Order Granting Preliminary Approval, this Court approved a proposed \nNotice Program and Class Notice, which provided members of the Settlement Class notice of this \nproposed settlement with Defendants.  The Notice Program provided an opportunity for class \nmembers to file objections to the Settlement. \n4.  The settling  Parties have  filed  with the Court a declaration  from  KinsellaINovak \nCommunications, Ltd., declaring that the mailing oft he Court-approved Notice, consistent with the \n1 Capitalized terms used in this Order have the meaning assigned to them in the Settlement Agreement, Order of \nPreliminary Approval of Settlement, Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action and this Order. \n2 \n\nNotice Program, has been completed. \n5.  The Court finds that the published, direct notice and Internet posting constitute the best \npracticable notice ofthe Fairness Hearing, the proposed Settlement, Class Counsel's application for \nfees and expenses, and other matters set forth in the Class Notice and the Summary Notice; and that \nsuch notice constituted valid, due and sufficient notice to all members of the Settlement Class, and \ncomplied fully with the requirements of Rule 23  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \nConstitution of the United States, the laws of New York and any other applicable law. \n6.  Any persons who wished to excluded from this Settlement were provided an opportunity \nto \"opt out\" pursuant to the Notice.  All persons who have validly excluded themselves from this \nAction have no rights under the Settlement Agreement and shall not be bound by the Settlement \nAgreement or the final judgment herein. \n7.  Settlement Class Members are bound by the Settlement, the Settlement Agreement and \nreleases  contained therein,  and  the Final Order and  Judgment,  and  do  not have  any further \nopportunity to opt-out of the Action. \n8.  Any Class member who did not timely file and serve an objection in writing to the \nSettlement Agreement, to the entry of Final Order and Judgment, or to Class Counsel's application \nfor fees, costs, and expenses, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice and \nmandated in the Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement, is deemed to have waived any \nsuch objection by appeal, collateral attack, or otherwise. \n9.  On the basis of all of the issues in this litigation, and the provisions of the Settlement \nAgreement, the Court is of the opinion that the Settlement is a fair, reasonable and adequate \ncompromise of the claims against the Defendants in this case, pursuant to Rule 23 ofthe Federal \n3 \n\nRules of Civil Procedure. There are a number of factors which the Court has considered in affinning \nthis Settlement, including: \na.  The liability issues in this case have been vigorously contested. \nb.  The Court notes that for settlement purposes, this Settlement has the benefit of \nproviding relief to members ofthe class now, without further litigation, under circumstances where \nthe liability issues are still vigorously contested among the parties to this litigation. This Settlement \nprovides Settlement Class Members with a substantial benefit, which might not have been available \nwere this litigation to continue. \nc.  This Settlement is clearly a byproduct of hard-fought litigation between the \nparties, and not a result of any collusion on the part of Class Counselor Counsel for the Defendants. \n10. Class Counsel submitted to the Court and served on the Defendants their application for \nreasonable  attorneys'  fees,  costs,  and  expenses  consistent with  the  tenns of the  Settlement \nAgreement.  This Court has considered Class Counsel's request and hereby grants the request. \n11. The claims procedure established under the Settlement Agreement is fair, a simplified \nprocess and workable. In any event, the Court will retain j urisdiction to work out any unanticipated \nproblems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT \nAND THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n12. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this proceeding. \n13. Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the following Settlement \nClass is certified for purposes of final settlement: \nAll persons who were placed into the custody of the Rensselaer \n4 \n\nCounty Jail during the period June 26, 1999, through and including \nJuly 1, 2002, after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \nviolations  of probation  or  parole,  traffic  infractions,  or  civil \ncommitments and were strip searched upon their entry into the Jail. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all \nof their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, \nemployees or assignees. \n14. The Court finds that, for the purpose of this Settlement, the requirements of Rule 23 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are satisfied, and that a class action is an appropriate method for \nresolving the disputes in this litigation. All the prerequisites for Class certification under Rule 23 are \npresent. The Class members are ascertainable and too numerous to be joined. Questions oflaw and \nfact common to all Class members predominate over individual issues and should be determined in \none proceeding with respect to all Class members. The Class Representatives' claims are typical of \nthose of the Class. The class action mechanism is superior to alternative means for adjudicating and \nresolving this action. \n15. Settlement Class Representatives are entitled to and are hereby awarded a payment of \n$72,000, over and above their respective proceeds under the Settlement Agreement and as set forth \nin the Settlement Agreement, in recognition of the efforts they have undertaken and the risk they \nhave incurred in connection with this Action. \n16. The Court grants final approval of the Settlement Agreement, including the distribution of \nthe proceeds of the settlement, as being fair, reasonable and adequate, pursuant to Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n17. The Courts finds that the request for attorneys' fees is reasonable. \nNOW, THEREFORE, ON THE BASIS OF THE FOREGOING FINDINGS OF FACT \nAND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED \nAS FOLLOWS: \n5 \n\n18. The Motion for Final Approval of the Proposed Settlement is GRANTED. \n19. Settlement Class Representatives are entitled to and are hereby awarded an additional \npayment of $72,000 over and above their claims for damages, in accordance with the Settlement \nAgreement,  in recognition of the efforts they have undertaken and the risk they incurred in \nconnection with this Action. \n20. The Class Counsel's application for attorneys' fees and expenses is granted. \n21. These Actions and all claims against the Defendants are hereby dismissed with prejudice, \nbut the Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the Actions, all Parties, and \nSettlement Class Members, to interpret and enforce the terms, conditions and obligations of this \nSettlement Agreement. \n22. All Class members who have not timely filed a Request For Exclusion are barred and \nenjoined from commencing and/or prosecuting any settled claim or action against the Defendants. \nAny Class member who has not timely filed a Request For Exclusion is enjoined from initiating any \naction, or continuing to prosecute any filed action, in any forum. \nThis the __ day  _______,  2004. \nThe Honorable Thomas J.

You give up your right to sue \nDefendants on these claims later. \nThese rights and options - and the deadlines to exercise them - are explained in this \nnotice. \nThe Court in charge of this case still has to decide whether to give final approval to the \nSettlement.  Likewise, payments to class members will be distributed only if the Court \ngrants final approval to the Settlement and after any appeals are resolved. \nBASIC INFORMATION \nI.  WHY DID I GET THIS NOTICE PACKAGE? \nYou or someone in your family may have entered the Rensselaer County Jail on misdemeanor or \n2 \n\nother minor charges from June 26, 1999 until July 1,2002 and been subject to a strip search. \nThe Court sent you this notice because you have a right to know about a proposed settlement of a \nclass action, and about your options, before the Court decides whether to approve the settlement. \nIf the Court approves it and after objections and appeals are resolved, an administrator appointed \nby the Court will make the payments that the settlement allows.  You will be informed of the \nprogress of the settlement. \nThis package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, \nwho is eligible for them, and how to get them. \nThe Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nNew York, United States Senior District Court Judge Thomas 1. McAvoy presiding, and the \ncases involved are know as Bruce v. County ofR ensselaer, Case No. 02-CV- 0847 and Kahler v. \nCounty ofR ensselaer. Case No. 03-CV -1324.  The people who sued are called Plaintiffs, and the \nmunicipality and municipal officials they sued, the County of Rensselaer, its Correctional \nemployees and elected officials, are called the Defendants. \nII.  WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? \nThe lawsuit claimed that the County of Rensselaer illegally strip searched individuals \nadmitted to the Rensselaer County Jail who were charged with only misdemeanors and other \nminor crimes, in violation ofthe unreasonable search provisions contained in the United States \nConstitution.  Defendants deny they did anything wrong, and further claim that the bulk of class \nmembers are not entitled to any money as a result of being searched. \nIII.  WHY IS THIS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Nathaniel \nBruce, Mark LaBelle, T'Shad Bradley, Natika Miller, William Garrity, Charles Linen, Wayne \nConine, Harold Bonesteel, Jeffrey Rockefeller, Peter Rupp and Paul Kahler), sue on behalf of all \npeople who have similar claims.  All these people are a Class or Class Members.  One Court \nresolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the \nClass.  United States Senior District Judge Thomas McAvoy is in charge of this class action. \nIV.  WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants.  Instead, both sides agreed \nto a settlement.  That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will \nget compensation.  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the settlement is best for \neveryone who was alleged to have been illegally searched. \n3 \n\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM PART OF THE SETTLEMENT? \nJudge McAvoy decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:  All \npersons who were placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail during the period June \n26, 1999, through and including July 1,2002, after being charged with misdemeanors, violations, \ntraffic violations, violations of probation or parole or civil commitments and were strip searched \nupon their entry into the Jail.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and \nall of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nThe Settlement does not cover individuals charged with felony offenses at the time of \ntheir entry into the Rensselaer County Jail. \nVI.  DO  I  NEED  TO  PROVE  I  WAS  STRIP-SEARCHED,  AND  WHAT  DOES \nTHAT MEAN? \nNo, you do not need to prove you were subjected to such a search.  In filling out the \nclaim  form,  you  will  affirm,  under  penalty of peIjury,  that  you  were  strip  searched,  and \nDefendants will accept this affirmation.  Provided that your name is detailed in booking records \nmaintained by Rensselaer County, your affirmation will entitle you to payment.  If your name is \nnot  contained  in  Rensselaer  County's  records,  you  may  be  asked  to  provide  additional \ndocumentation before being allowed to participate in the settlement. \nA strip search occurred when you were ordered to take off some or all of your clothes by \na Rensselaer County employee, with that employee watching you undress or forcing  you to \nundress out in the open.  Some members of the class may also have been forced to bend at the \nwaist or manipulate body parts to allow for a visual inspection.  The bulk of Rensselaer County's \nsearches occurred in the shower area of the booking room behind a \"half wall.\"  If you were \nsearched in this matter when first booked into the facility, you are a member of the class and \nentitled to make a claim.  You will need to provide an affirmation on the claim form. \nVII.  I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED AFTER RECEIVING A VISIT AND ALSO WHEN \nRETURNING  FROM  COURT  WHEN  I  WAS  IN  THE  RENSSELAER \nCOUNTY JAIL.  DOES THIS MEAN I CAN ALSO MAKE A CLAIM? \nNo.  Searches of this type are permissible.  You can only make a claim if you were \nsubjected to such a search when you first entered the facility; meaning when your picture and \nfingerprints were taken and you received the jail uniform. \n4 \n\nVIII.  HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS CHARGED \nUPON  ADMISSION  TO THE  RENSSELAER COUNTY JAIL  QUALIFIES  ME  FOR \nINCLUSION IN THE CLASS? \nNew York law creates three distinct categories of offenses:  Felonies, Misdemeanors and \nViolations.  Felonies are the most serious crimes, and are usually punishable by incarceration in \nstate  prison.  Felony  offenses  are  usually  handled  by  a  County  Court  Judge,  and  require \nindictment by a grand jury.  Murder, burglary and rape are examples of felony offenses.  Anyone \ncharged with a felony upon admission to the Rensselaer County Jail, even if they were also \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations at the same time, is not a member of the class unless \nthey were, on another occasion, admitted to RCJ solely on misdemeanor or violation charges. \nMisdemeanors are minor crimes, and are, at most, subject to incarceration in a local jail. \nMisdemeanor offenses are handled by a City, Town or Village Court Judge, and do not require \nindictment.  Assault in the Third Degree, Petty Larceny and Unlawful Possession of Fireworks \nare examples of misdemeanor offenses.  Anyone charged with a misdemeanor on their admission \nto the Rensselaer County Jail is a member of the class. \nViolations  are  minor  infractions,  and  are  not  considered  criminal  conduct.  While \nviolations can result in brief incarceration in a local jail, they are generally resolved with a fine. \nViolations are handled by a City, Town or Village Court Judge, and do not require indictment. \nDisorderly conduct, Unlawful Possession of Marijuana, traffic violations and city code violations \nare  examples  of violations.  Anyone  charged  with  a  violation  on  their  admission  to  the \nRensselaer County Jail is a member of the class. \nThe class further allows for  individuals to make claims if they were admitted to  the \nRensselaer County Jail for violating the terms of their probation or parole, or ifthey were subject \nto a civil commitment.  Probation or parole is often provided as a condition of release following \na criminal conviction.  Parole is only assessed if an individual has served time in state prison.  If \nan individual was charged solely for violating parole or probation, for instance, not honoring \ntheir conditions of supervision or violating curfew, they are considered to be a member of the \nclass.  If  an  individual  was  charged  with  violating  probation  or  parole  and  also \ncontemporaneously charged with misdemeanors, they are also a member of the class.  If an \nindividual was charged with violating probation or parole and also contemporaneously charged \nwith a felony, they are not a member of the class.  A civil commitment is an order from a non \ncriminal court, usually the Family Court, committing an individual to the Rensselaer County Jail. \nIndividuals  admitted to  the  Rensselaer County Jail  on  a civil  commitment,  for  example,  a \ncommitment for failure to pay child support, are members of the class. \nIX.  I  WAS  ADMITTED  TO  THE  RENSSELAER  COUNTY  JAIL  BUT  CANNOT \nREMEMBER WHAT MY CRIMINAL CHARGES WERE.  HOW CAN I FIND THIS \nOUT,  AND  HOW  DO  I  KNOW  IF  THE  CHARGE  WAS  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR \nVIOLATION? \n5 \n\nThere a several ways for potential class members to determine the nature of their criminal \ncharges.  First, you can review your charging documents, which should reflect both your actual \ncharges and whether the charges were a misdemeanor or violation.  For instance, the criminal \ncomplaint filed against you may state \"Assault in the Third Degree,\" a \"Class A Misdemeanor,\" \nor something similar for each separate charge.  If you do not have your charging documents and \nremember the local court where you were prosecuted, the court clerk will also be able to help \nyou find these documents. \nIf you need additional help in determining whether you are a class member, or if you \nhave other questions, you can contact the settlement administrator at 1-800- , as they \nmay be able to help you directly or have class counsel call you to answer your questions. \nYou can still make a claim if you do not remember your criminal charges if you believe \nyou are a member of the Class, but you may be asked for additional information. \nX.  I PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MY RIGHT TO \nPA  RTIPATE IN THE SETTLEMENT? \nIf you were admitted to the Rensselaer County Jail solely on misdemeanor or other minor \ncharges, as defined above, you can participate in the settlement regardless of how you resolved \nyour criminal charges.  Even if you pled guilty to a crime, you may still recover just like any \nother class member. \nXI.  WHAT  IF  I  WAS  ADMITTED  TO  THE  RENSSELAER  COUNTY  JAIL  ON \nMORE  THAN  ONE  OCCASION?  CAN  I  STILL  PARTICIPATE  IN  THE \nSETTLEMENT? \nYes.  Individuals who were admitted to the Rensselaer County Jail on more than one \noccasion during the class period are members of the class and can recover money.  They can only \nrecover one payment, however, meaning that you will not be provided with extra payments if \nadmitted to the RCJ more than one time. \nXII.  I AM STILL NOT SURE IF I AM INCLUDED. \nIf you are still not sure whether you are included, you can ask for help.  You can call 1-\n800- and the settlement administrator or class counsel may help answer your questions.  For \nmore information, you can also visit the website, www.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com.  Or \nyou can fill out and return the claim form described on page _, in question _, to see if you \nqualify. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET \nXIII.  WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \n6 \n\nDefendants have agreed to provide a settlement fund amount of $2.7 million to \ncompensate Class Members who have been illegally strip searched, and have agreed to alter their \nsearch policies for new detainees to the Rensselaer County Jail.  Defendants have also agreed to \npay for attorneys' fees and expenses, up to a maximum of $580,000, and provide incentive \nawards for the eleven class representatives up to a maximum amount of $72,000.  Defendants \nhave also agreed to pay all the expenses of notifying the class about, and administering all \naspects of, this Settlement, and delivering payments to class members.  Attorneys' fees, \nadministration costs and incentive awards are taken out of the settlement fund amount.  A \ncomplete description of the settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement and Release. \nYou can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement and Release by visiting \nwww.rensselaercountyjailsettlement.com. or by calling 1-800-. \nXIV.  WHAT CAN I GET FROM THE SETTLEMENT? \nThe settlement provides that all class members who make claims will receive a payment \nof up to $1,000.00, depending on the number of valid claims that are made. \nIf you have any liens in place from the Rensselaer County Department of Social Services, \nRensselaer County has agreed to waive those liens as it relates to payments from this settlement. \nXV.  WHAT IF I WAS STRIP-SEARCHED AFTER JULY 1, 2002? \nIf you were strip searched after July 1, 2002, you are not a member of this class action \nand are not entitled to a settlement payment.  You are not bound by this settlement for those \nclaims.  This means you can pursue your claims separately from this settlement with your own \nlawyer. \nHOW YOU GET A PAYMENT - SUBMITTING A CLAIM FORM \nXVI.  HOWCANIGETAPAYMENT? \nMUST \nTo qualify for payment, you  send in a claim form.  A claim form is attached \nto this Notice.

WHEN WOULD I GET MY PAYMENT? \nThe Court will hold a hearing on  , 2004 to decide whether to approve the \nsettlement.  If Judge McAvoy approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals.  You will \nonly receive payment after these appeals are completed.  It is always uncertain whether these \nappeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year.  Everyone \nwho sends in a claim form will be informed of the progress of the settlement.  Please be patient. \n7 \n\nXVIII.  WHAT AM I GIVING UP TO GET A PAYMENT OR STAY IN THE CLASS? \nUnless you exclude yourself, you are staying in the Class, and that means you can't sue, \ncontinue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against Rensselaer County, its employees, or its \nelected officials about the legal issues in this case.  It also means that all of the Court's orders \nwill apply to you and legally bind you.  If you sign the claim fonn, you will agree to release all \nclaims that you have related to your having been strip searched. \nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT \nIf you do not want a payment from this settlement, but you want to keep the right to sue \nor continue to sue Rensselaer County, on your own, about the legal issues in this case, then you \nmust take steps to get out of the settlement.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nPAUL ADAM KAHLER, \nboth individually and on behalf of a class of : \nothers similarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nCivil Action No. \nv.  03-CV -l324 (TJMIDRH) \nTHE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER, \nDANIEL KEATING, \nboth individually and in his \nofficial capacity as Sheriff of the County of :  FIRST AMENDED \nRensselaer, LARRY W ALRAED, both  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nindividually and as Undersheriff of the \nCounty of Rensselaer, ROBERT \nLOVERIDGE, both individually and as \nColonel in the Rensselaer County Sheriff s \nDepartment, HAROLD SMITH, both  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nindividually and as Lieutenant in the \nRensselaer County Sheriff s Department, \nand KATHLEEN JIMINO, both individually: \nand as County Executive of the County of \nRensselaer, \nDefendants. \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights \nsecured to the Plaintiff and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws \nof the United States of America.  For at least the past fourteen years, the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriff s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Rensselaer County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \n1 \n\nthe  written  procedures  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs  Department,  and  was \npromulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  Sheriff Daniel \nKeating,  Undersheriff Larry  Walraed,  Colonel  Robert  Loveridge,  Lieutenant  Harold \nSmith and Rensselaer County Executive Kathleen Jimino. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Rensselaer \nCounty and the  Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department to  force  those charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary.  It is also just \nthe latest indication of a County Jail that is mismanaged and where the civil rights of \nthose  who  enter,  even  for  a  brief stay  on  minor  charges,  are  simply  ignored  or \nconsciously trampled upon. \nPaul Kahler brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class of \nthousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class \nmembers he proposes to represent.  Mr. Kahler was sent to the Rensselaer County Jail on \ntwo  occasions  during  the  class period  after being charged with  misdemeanor and/or \nviolation offenses, and was subject to a strip search on both occasions, in violation of his \nrights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  He seeks monetary damages for himself and each member of the proposed \nclass, a declaration that the Sheriff's Department's policies are unconstitutional, and an \ninjunction  precluding  Rensselaer  County  and  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs \n2 \n\nDepartment from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With \nthis as a background, Plaintiff Paul Kahler hereby complains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.c. \n§  1331,  1341  &  1343  because  it  is  filed  to obtain  compensatory damages,  punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.c.  §§  1981  & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs'  claims  and  those  of proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Paul Kahler (\"Kahler\")  is  19  years old and resides in Rensselaer \nCounty.  On or about April 8,2000, Kahler (then age sixteen) was arrested on charges of \ncriminal mischief in the fourth degree (a misdemeanor) and placed in the custody of the \nRensselaer County Jail.  On or about October 26, 2001, Kahler (then age seventeen) was \nagain arrested on charges of assault in the third degree (a misdemeanor) and harassment \nin the  second degree  (a violation),  and was  placed  in  the  custody of the  Rensselaer \nCounty JaiL \n3 \n\n4.

Larry Walraed's principal place of business is 4000 Main Street,  Troy,  NY \n12180.  Larry Walraed is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and \nofficial capacities. \n8.  Defendant Robert  Loveridge  (\"Colonel  Loveridge\")  is  the  duly  appointed \nColonel of the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department and is the officer in charge of the \noperation of the Rensselaer County Jail.  As such, Colonel Loveridge is a policy maker \nwith respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises \ncustodial or other control.  Colonel Loveridge's principal place of business is 4000 Main \nStreet, Troy, NY  12180.  Colonel Loveridge is made a Defendant in this action in both \nhis individual and official capacities. \n9.

Lieutenant Smith's principal place of business is 4000 Main \nStreet, Troy, NY  12180.  Lieutenant Smith is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities. \n10. Defendant Kathleen Jimino (\"County Executive Jimino\") is the duly elected \nCounty Executive of Rensselaer County and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to \nthe treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the RCJ exercises custodial or \nother control.  County Executive Jimino's principal place of business is the Rensselaer \nCounty Office Building, Seventh Avenue, Troy, NY  12180.  County Executive Jimino is \nmade a Defendant in this action in both her individual and official capacities. \n11. Collectively, Sheriff Keating, Larry Walraed, Colonel Loveridge, Lieutenant \nSmith  and  County  Executive  Jimino  will  be  referred  to  as  the  \"Policy  Making \nDefendants. \" \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals  who  were  charged  with  misdemeanors  or minor  crimes  and  were  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Rensselaer County Jail. \n13. The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll  persons  who  were  placed  into  the  custody  of the \nRensselaer County Jail during the  period June 26,  1999, \nthrough and  including July  1,  2002,  after being charged \nwith misdemeanors, violations,  violations of probation or \nparole, traffic infractions, or civil commitments and were \nstrip searched upon their entry into the Jail.  Specifically \nexcluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of \ntheir  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees. \n14. This action has been subject to a prior complaint to this Court, filed on June \n26, 2002, where the Court, for scheduling reasons, declined to entertain a motion for class \ncertification.  See,  Bruce v.  County of Rensselaer,  No.  02-CV -0847 (TJMlDRH).  To \ndate,  no  motion to dismiss the class action allegations has been raised,  and the class \nallegations themselves have not been stricken from the complaint.  Consequently, the \nclass is defined from June 26, 1999 to present. \n15. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law  and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n16. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon infonnation and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail every month \n7 \n\nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on multiple occasions. \n17. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the  large number of class members  and the  fact  that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Rensselaer County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n18. Common questions oflaw and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n19. Plaintiff's claim is typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  Plaintiff \nand all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' course of \nconduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered by the \nclass members. \n20. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n8 \n\n21. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum \nMenken & Ben-Asher, LLP; and Gary E. Mason and Charles Schneider of The Mason \nLaw Firm, PLLC.  Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas litigated a wide variety of civil rights actions before this Court, and has litigated class \naction lawsuits in state and federal  courts in five  states.  Mr.  Keach has successfully \nlitigated strip search cases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady \nCity School District, and has previously litigated two other cases against the Rensselaer \nCounty Sheriffs Department, including one on behalf of a sixteen year old girl raped by \na Corrections Officer. \n22. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys \nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. \nMenken  and Mr.  Rozger have successfully represented many victims of illegal strip \nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the \nCity of New York. \n23. Gary E. Mason is one of this country's premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal  court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class  actions,  including In Re  The  Exxon Valdez,  In Re Diet Drugs Product \n9 \n\nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  In \naddition to his extensive experience as a class action and environmental lawyer, Charles \nSchneider is a fonner trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights \nDivision and has successfully litigated a series of cases involving corrections misconduct. \n24. In  short, Plaintiffs counsel has the resources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this  action  against Rensselaer  County,  the  Rensselaer  County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of \nno conflicts among members ofthe class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n25. This action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As  such,  the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County \nJail.  In short, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department, the \nPolicy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections Officers acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n26. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b )(3). \n27. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' de facto policy of strip searching all \nindividuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Rensselaer \n10 \n\nCounty Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, and whether such a de facto policy existed during the class period. \n28. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass  to  redress  the wrongs done  to  them.  The cost to  the  federal  court  system  of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould  also  magnify the delay and  expense to  all parties  and the  court  system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n29. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions (other than Bruce) \npending to address the Defendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of \nindividuals,  even  though  the  Defendants  have  maintained  their  illegal  strip  search \nregimen  for  at  least  the  past  twelve  years,  with  the  practice  being  declared \nunconstitutional in this judicial circuit in 1986. \n30. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n31. The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers they supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes  unless  the  officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n32. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriff's Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a de facto policy, \ncustom  or practice  of strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  custody  of the \nRensselaer County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged  crime  and  without  the  presence  of reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n33. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriff's Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a defacto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the \nvaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively \nreferred to as \"strip searches.\" \n34. The County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Department, and \nthe  Policy Making  Defendants  know  that  they may not  institute,  enforce  or  permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \n12 \n\nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.  1986).  In fact, this decision was recently cited \nby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in one of many civil rights cases to \nbe successfully prosecuted against the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department.  See, \nSagendorf-Teal  v.  County  of Rensselaer,  100  F.3d  270,  276  (2d  Cir.  1996)  (citing \nWeber). \n35. The Defendants' de facto policy, practice and custom mandating wholesale \nstrip  searches  of all  misdemeanor  and  violation  arrestees  has  been  promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law. \n36. Upon information and belief, not only is the policy of strip searching illegal, \nbut the manner in which individuals are searched is also impermissible.  For example, \nupon information and belief, individuals are strip searched in the presence of corrections \nofficers, jail employees and/or arrestees of the opposite gender. \n37.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n38. Upon information and belief, the County of Rensselaer, the Rensselaer County \nSheriffs Department and  the  Individual  Defendants  have  promulgated,  implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching \nall individuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and placed into jail \nclothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any \n13 \n\nsort.  This de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither \nthe nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances \nof a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom \nof routine strip searches. \n39. Pursuant to this de facto policy, each member of the Class, including every \nnamed  Plaintiff,  was  the  victim  of a routine  strip  search  upon  their  entry  into  the \nRensselaer  County  Jail.  These  searches  were  conducted  without  inquiry  into  or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion,  and  in fact  were  not supported by reasonable \nsuspicion.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n40. The  strip  searches  in  question  largely  occurred  in  an  open  area  of the \nRensselaer County Jail booking room, behind a \"half wall\" near the booking computers \nutilized by RCJ employees.  This open area is in clear view of all six prisoner holding \ncells in the booking room, and can also been seen by Corrections Officers on an elevated \nplatform, from windows in the booking room and from larger holding cells utilized to \nprepare inmates for transport. \n41. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches - each member \nof the class, including every named Plaintiff  has suffered or will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n42. Additionally, Defendant Daniel Keating, in his capacity as Sheriff and chief \npolicy  maker  for  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail,  together  with  the  Policy  Making \nDefendants, have promulgated a written policy purporting to govern the strip searches of \n14 \n\nindividuals detained in the Rensselaer County Jail.  This written policy, attached to this \nAmended Complaint as Exhibit A, does not provide that all individuals placed into the \ncustody of the Rensselaer County Jail are subject to being strip-searched. \n43. This written policy, however, is not followed in the Rensselaer County Jail, as \nadmitted by Colonel  Loveridge  and  Lieutenant James  Karam during their deposition \ntestimony.  While some (but not all) correctional employees maintain that strip searches \nwere based on reasonable suspicion,  proof taken in  this  action demonstrates that the \nRensselaer County Jail employs a de facto policy, as set forth above, that provides that all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Rensselaer County Jail and placed into jail \nclothing are subject to a strip-search. \n44. Additionally,  the  Defendants  claim  that  they  provided  training  to  their \nsubordinates about various policies relative to strip-searching, including the need for a \nsupervisor to approve of a strip-search and make a written report, the use of an unwritten \n\"clothing change\" policy, and the requirement that reasonable suspicion be present when \nconducting a strip search.  Discovery in this action has shown, however, that there has \nbeen absolutely no substantive training about booking procedures or strip searches during \nthe class period,  or even since the commencement of this  action.  COs received no \ntraining whatsoever relative to the circumstances under which they could conduct a strip \nsearch, and instead learned procedures by observing other officers in the booking room. \n45. Nevertheless, the written policy promulgated by Defendant Keating and the \nPolicy Making Defendants is, on its face, unconstitutionaL \n15 \n\n46. The  written  policy  provides  that  strip-searches  may  be  conducted  on \nindividuals arrested for misdemeanors and violations without requiring particularized, \nreasonable suspicion that those individuals are concealing contraband or a weapon. \n47. The  written  policy provides  that  anyone  charged  with  a  crime  involving \nviolence  or drugs  is  subject  to  a  strip  search,  even in the  absence of particularized \nreasonable suspicion. \n48. The written policy also  states that anyone who  appears  in the  Rensselaer \nCounty Jail that is under the influence of alcohol or drugs (in the subjective opinion of \nthe search officer) is subject to a strip search regardless of the nature of their criminal \ncharges and in the absence of particularized reasonable suspicion. \n49. The written policy further provides that  anyone  arrested  for the following \noffenses,  even  in  the  absence  of particularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  are \npossessing contraband or a weapon, is subject to a strip search:  Sexual Misconduct (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Imprisonment  (A  Misdemeanor);  Resisting  Arrest  (A \nMisdemeanor); Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Seventh Degree (A \nMisdemeanor);  Criminally  Using  Drug  Paraphernalia  in  the  Second  Degree  (A \nMisdemeanor);  Unlawful  Possession  of Marijuana  (Violation);  Disorderly  Conduct \n(Violation);  Harassment  in  the  First  Degree  (B  Misdemeanor);  Public  Drunkenness \n(Violation);  Unlawfully  Dealing  with  Fireworks  and  Dangerous  Fireworks  (B \nMisdemeanor); Unlawful Possession of Weapons by Persons Under Sixteen (Juvenile \nOffense); Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Fourth Degree (A Misdemeanor); \nInciting a Riot (A Misdemeanor); Riot in the Second Degree (A Misdemeanor); Killing \nor Injuring a Police Animal (A Misdemeanor); and Self Abortion (A Misdemeanor). \n16 \n\n50. This written policy also provides that someone who has ever been charged \nwith  a  \"strip-searchable\" offense  may,  if later  arrested  for  a  non  \"strip  searchable\" \ncharge, be strip searched without the necessity of particularized, reasonable suspicion. \nThese individuals are termed \"permanently strip searchable\" in the policy. \n51. The written policy does not state that strip searches will only be performed by \nmembers of the same gender as the accused, and does not state that individuals of the \nopposite gender should not be present during the search. \n52. The written policy is, for these reasons, unconstitutional on its face. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff \nPaul Kahler \n53. Mr.  Kahler's experience is representative.  On or about April 8,  2000, Mr. \nKahler was charged with Criminal Mischief in the Fourth Degree, a misdemeanor, for \nallegedly punching a wall.  Mr. Kahler subsequently resolved these charges by pleading \nguilty and receiving probation.  Mr. Kahler is presently 19 years old.  He was taken into \ncustody by the East Greenbush Police Department.  Mr.  Kahler's transporting officer \ninformed the booking staff at RCJ that Mr. Kahler was \"real [sic] cooperative.\" \n54. Subsequent to his arrest, Mr. Kahler was transported to the Rensselaer County \nJail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Kahler was moved into the shower area (behind the half wall) \nof the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  This area is visible from \nevery holding cell, as well as from much of the booking room.  As Corrections Officers \nwatched, Mr. Kahler was ordered to, and did, remove his clothing.  Mr. Kahler objected \nto having to remove his clothing, and was told to \"just do it.\" \n17 \n\n55.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Kahler to \"face the wall,\" and told \nhim to \"squat.\"  The officer instructed Mr. Kahler to \"lift your sack\" to allow for an \nexamination  underneath  his  scrotum.  After  the  completion of the  examination,  the \nCorrections Officer made disparaging comments to Mr. Kahler about the color of his \nunderpants. \n56. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Kahler was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nofMr. Kahler that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, \nbecause Mr. Kahler had already been in custody of police officers from the Town of East \nGreenbush, the Corrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. \nKahler had already been subjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed \nany weapons or contraband. \n57. On or about October 26, 2001, Mr. Kahler was charged with Assault in the \nThird Degree, a misdemeanor, and Harassment in the Second Degree, a violation,  for \nallegedly getting in a fist fight with his brother.  These charges were later dismissed.  Mr. \nKahler was taken into custody by the East Greenbush Police Department. \n58. Subsequent to his arrest, Mr. Kahler was transported to the Rensselaer County \nJail.  Soon thereafter, Mr. Kahler was moved into the shower area (behind the half wall) \nof the RCJ booking room and ordered to remove his clothing.  As Corrections Officers \nwatched, Mr. Kahler was ordered to, and did, remove his clothing.  Mr. Kahler was then \ntold to tum around and \"squat.\" \n18 \n\n59. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Kahler was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was made \nof Mr. Kahler that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  Moreover, \nbecause Mr. Kahler had already been in custody of police officers from the Town of East \nGreenbush, the Corrections Officer in question knew or should have known that Mr. \nKahler had already been SUbjected to a search incident to arrest that would have revealed \nany weapons or contraband. \n60.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip searches conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff's Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Kahler has \nsuffered and continues to  suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n19 \n\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law --\n61. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges  each and  every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 60. \n62. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  umeasonable searches by law  enforcement officers,  and prohibits officers  from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n63. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Rensselaer \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making Defendants to  order/direct Rensselaer County Corrections Officers  to \nconduct such searches. \n64. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Rensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sheriffs Department.  As such, \nthe County of Rensselaer is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class. \n65. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Keating,  Larry  Walraed,  Colonel \nLoveridge,  Lieutenant  Smith  and  County  Executive  Jimino  are  responsible  for \n20 \n\nestablishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of the Rensselaer \nCounty  Jail,  and  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of the  strip  search  policy \nquestioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Keating, Walraed, Loveridge, Smith and Jimino are \neach individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the \nClass. \n66. Sheriff Keating,  Larry Walraed,  Colonel  Loveridge,  Lieutenant Smith and \nCounty Executive Jimino knew that the RCJ's strip search policy was illegal, and acted \nwillfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the \nClass of their Constitutional rights. \n67. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n68. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \n21 \n\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n69. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 68. \n70. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment,  the  County of Rensselaer and  the  Policy Making  Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n71. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Rensselaer and the \nRensselaer County Sheriffs Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n72. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 71. \n73. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Rensselaer  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment,  the  County of Rensselaer  and  the  Policy Making  Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Rensselaer  County  Jail  without  any \n22 \n\nparticularized  SUSpICIOn  that  the  individuals  III  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n74. Upon infonnation and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Rensselaer \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nhanns that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n75. The  continuing  pattern  of strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  mmor \ncrimes will cause irreparable hann to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n76. Plaintiff demands  that  the  County  of Rensselaer,  the  Rensselaer  County \nSheriffs Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Rensselaer County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe Rensselaer County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and pennanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \n23 \n\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n77.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n78. The conduct of the  Individual Defendants  herein represents just the  latest \nexample of a County Jail and Sheriffs Department that is completely mismanaged.  In \nrecent  years,  the Jail has come under scrutiny for  a series of incidents involving the \nexcessive use of force against inmates (where the County and the Sheriffs Department \ninevitably blames the inmates for \"injuring\" themselves), the rape of a juvenile inmate by \na Corrections Officer, deliberate indifference to those with psychological problems, and \nthe illegal termination of a Corrections Officer who detailed the application of excessive \nforce in an administrative report.  The Sheriffs Department has also recently been sued \nfor  firing,  and prosecuting on felony charges, one of its own deputies for  supposedly \nmisusing a sick day. \n79. It is clear that the Individual Defendants, the County of Rensselaer and the \nRensselaer County Sheriffs Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto punish the Individual Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements \nof the  United  States  Constitution  also  apply  to  government  officials  in  Rensselaer \nCounty. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n80. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n24 \n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Paul Kahler, on behalf of himself and on behalf of a \nclass  of others  similarly  situated,  request  that  this  Honorable  Court  grant  him  the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs First \nand Fourth Causes of Action detailed herein, awarding Compensatory Damages to each \nnamed Plaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by \na Jury and/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A judgment against Defendant Daniel Keating on Plaintiffs First and Fourth \nCauses of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A judgment against Defendant Larry Walraed on Plaintiffs First and Fourth \nCauses of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nE.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  Robert  Loveridge  on  Plaintiffs  First  and \nFourth Causes of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nF.  A  judgment against  Defendant Hal  Smith  on  Plaintiffs First  and  Fourth \nCauses of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nG.  A judgment against Defendant Kathleen Jimino on Plaintiffs First and Fourth \nCauses of Action for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nH.  A  declaratory judgment  against  all  Defendants  declaring  the  County  of \nRensselaer and the Rensselaer County Sherifrs Department's policy, practice and custom \nof strip  and visual cavity searching all detainees entering the Rensselaer County Jail, \n25 \n\nregardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and \nImproper. \nI.  A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enJommg  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to  strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nJ.  A monetary award for attorney's fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Fed. R. Civ.
