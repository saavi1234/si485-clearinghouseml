    "summary": "<p>On October 20, 2004, a woman who had been subjected to a strip search after being charged with resisting arrest filed a class action civil rights lawsuit in the  U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the Contra Costa County Sheriff's policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches and visual body cavity searches in the Contra Costa County Jail.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that she was arrested on March 1, 2004 for resisting arrest (misdemeanor) and was taken to Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez, California, where she subjected to a strip search and body cavity search.  Plaintiff also alleged that she was compelled to produce a urine sample while being directly observed by male deputies. Plaintiff alleged that her search was conducted pursuant to the Contra Costa County Sheriff's blanket policy of subjecting all detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned, regardless of whether any reasonable suspicion existed that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  This policy, plaintiff alleged, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.   </p><p>Plaintiff moved to certify a class consisting of \"[a]ll persons, since October 20, 2002, and continuing until Defendants' prior custom and policy was brought into compliance with the law on June 1, 2003, or such other more recent date when the policy was implemented, who were arrested on any charge (including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled substances, or felony violence, and who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity search(es) by defendants before arraignment at the Contra Costa County Jails without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband. This class may include arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip searches before arraignment after the initial strip search, without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.\"</p><p>Plaintiffs' amended complaint was filed on August 11, 2005, adding an additional representative plaintiff who was arrested on December 3, 2002 (prior to the June 1, 2003 policy change) for a felony DUI charge and then strip searched.  Defendants moved to dismiss his claims as time barred. The District Court (District Judge Thelton E. Henderson) granted defendants' motion to dismiss, with respect to the individual's state law claim for monetary relief, but denied the motion as to his § 1983 claim for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief.  Barnett v. County of Contra Costa, 2005 WL 5095264 (N.D. Cal. Oct 31, 2005).</p><p>On April 10, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, denied plaintiffs' request for an interlocutory appeal of the District Court's order.  In June 2007, the district court held joint case management discussions concerning both individuals' cases.</p><p>On November 27, 2007, the plaintiffs were granted leave to file a second amended complaint, adding an additional individual as a representative plaintiff.</p><p>On September 11, 2009, the Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's state law claims, but denied summary judgment on the §1983 claim.  On November 3, 2009, the Court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification.</p><p>On June 21, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Class Action Complaint.  Three days later, the parties stipulated to dismissing the case with prejudice. The dismissal was agreed to pursuant to the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision in Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 565 F.3d 964.</p><p>The parties eventually reached a settlement agreement that was approved by the Court on March 18, 2011.  In this agreement, defendants agreed to pay $19,999 to one individual in return for her agreement to dismiss her claim with prejudice.</p>",

C04-4437 TEH\n6 Plaintiffs,\nORDER GRANTING\n7 v. PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR\nCLASS CERTIFICATION\n8 COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA,\net al.,\n9\nDefendants.\n10\nt\nr 11\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ second motion for class\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 certification.  After carefully considering the parties’ written arguments, the Court finds oral\nDis strict  14 argument to be unnecessary.  With good cause appearing for the reasons discussed below, the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Court now GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion.\nS N\ned  or the  16\nt F\ni 17 BACKGROUND\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs, who filed this case in 2004, contend that their constitutional rights were\n19 violated by Defendant Contra Costa County’s now-discontinued policy of performing visual\n20 body cavity searches and strip searches on all persons arrested and housed prior to\n21 arraignment.1  Initial discovery revealed that Rosalety Barnett, the original named plaintiff,\n22 was not searched pursuant to Defendants’ blanket policy concerning pre-arraignment\n23 searches, and Plaintiffs subsequently sought and obtained leave from this Court to file an\n24 amended complaint naming a new proposed class representative.  In 2007, the Court granted\n25 summary judgment as to claims by this second proposed named plaintiff, Peter Morganelli,\n26 concluding that the original complaint included only individuals arrested for misdemeanors\n27 1This Court has previously discussed the factual and procedural history of this case\nand will not repeat that background in detail here.  See, e.g., Jan. 24, 2007 Order at 2-4;\n28\nSept. 11, 2009 Order at 1-3,\n \n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page2 of 9\n1 while Morganelli was arrested for a felony, and that Morganelli’s individual claims were\n2 time-barred.  Jan. 24, 2007 Order at 4-9.  At the same time, the Court denied without\n3 prejudice Plaintiffs’ first motion for class certification because no proposed class\n4 representative remained in the case.  Id. at 10.\n5 On November 27, 2007, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint naming Adeline\n6 Chan as a proposed class representative.  They filed their second motion for class\n7 certification on July 6, 2009, with Chan as the sole proposed named plaintiff.  Defendants\n8 thereafter moved for summary judgment on Chan’s claims.  The Court granted as unopposed\n9 the motion for summary judgment on Chan’s state law claims but denied the motion as to\n10 Chan’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Sept. 11, 2009 Order at 5-7.  The parties subsequently\nt\nr 11 agreed to a revised briefing schedule on Plaintiffs’ second motion for class certification.\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 In response to Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ originally proposed class\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 definition, Plaintiffs revised their proposed class definition on reply.  Plaintiffs now seek to\nDis strict  14 certify the following class:\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 ADlelf epnedrsaonntss’,  spirniocer  cOucsttoobme ra 2n0d,  p2o0l0ic2y,  awnads  cbornotuignhuti nign tuontil\nS N\ned  or the  16 creocmenptl idaantcee  wwhiethn  tthhee  lpaowli ocyn  wJuanse i m1,p 2l0em03e,n oter ds,u wchh oo twheerr em aorrreested\nt F\ni 17 on any misdemeanor or lesser charge not involving weapons,\nn\nU controlled substances, or felony violence, and who were\n18 subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual\nbody cavity search(es) by defendants before arraignment at the\n19 Contra Costa County Jails without any individualized reasonable\nsuspicion that they were concealing contraband.  This class may\n20 also include arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket\nstrip searches before arraignment after the initial strip search,\n21 without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had\nsubsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.\n22\nAlso excluded from the class are those otherwise eligible\n23 arrestees who (1) have a history of at least one prior conviction or\ntwo prior arrests for excludable offenses within the last five\n24 years; (2) have a current probation condition which includes\nconsent to search; (3) upon arrest or detention, exhibit behavior\n25 or circumstances indicating they may be a danger to\nhimself/herself or others; [or] (4) are strip searched after\n26 arraignment.\n27 Ex.

Defendants’ Request for Stay\n3 The Court first addresses Defendants’ request for a stay pending resolution of the en\n4 banc proceedings in Bull v. City and County of San Francisco in the United States Court of\n5 Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Although the Court previously indicated that it was inclined\n6 to grant such a stay, it now agrees with Plaintiffs that a stay is not warranted at this time. \n7 Plaintiffs correctly observe that the issue before the en banc court in Bull – the\n8 constitutionality of a blanket strip search policy in San Francisco – does not impact whether\n9 certification of the proposed class in this case would be proper.  The Court therefore chooses\n10 not to exercise its discretion to stay the class certification decision pending the outcome in\nt\nr 11 Bull.  However, the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ contentions concerning delay are not\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 persuasive; the delay in moving this case forward has been due primarily to Plaintiffs’\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 difficulties in locating a suitable class representative.\nDis strict  14\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 II. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\nS N\ned  or the  16 Having denied Defendants’ request for a stay, the Court now turns to the merits of\nt F\ni 17 Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.\nn\nU\n18 A. Legal Standard\n19 A party seeking to certify a class must demonstrate that it has met all four\n20 requirements of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and at least one of the\n21 requirements of Rule 23(b).  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th\n22 Cir. 2001).  Rule 23(a) allows a class to be certified only if:\n23 (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable; \n24\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n25\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\n26\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\n27\n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect\n28 the interests of the class.\n  3\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page4 of 9\n1 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.  That is, the class must satisfy the\n2 requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.\n3 Rule 23(b) provides for the maintenance of three types of class actions.  Plaintiffs seek\n4 to certify the class under Rule 23(b)(3), which allows a class to be certified if “the court finds\n5 that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions\n6 affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available\n7 methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n8 The factors a court should consider when evaluating these issues include the following:\n9 (A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the\nprosecution or defense of separate actions;\n10\n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\nt\nr 11\nu controversy already begun by or against class members;\no\na\nC ni 12\n  or (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the\nct alif litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and\ntri of C 13\nDis strict  14 (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Id.\nS N\ned  or the  16 The party seeking certification must provide facts to satisfy the above requirements, \nt F\ni 17 Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1309 (9th Cir. 1977), and the district court\nn\nU\n18 must conduct a “rigorous analysis” of the moving party’s claims to examine whether the\n19 requirements are satisfied, Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982). \n20 Although the court is “at liberty” to consider evidence that relates to the merits if such\n21 evidence also goes to the requirements of Rule 23, Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d\n22 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992), the court may not consider whether the party seeking class\n23 certification has stated a cause of action or is likely to prevail on the merits, Eisen v. Carlisle\n24 & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974).  If a district court concludes that the moving party\n25 has met its burden of proof, then the court has broad discretion to certify the class.  Zinser,\n26 253 F.3d at 1186.\n27\n28\n  4\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page5 of 9\n1 B. Analysis\n2 In this case, Defendants do not dispute that the proposed class, class representative,\n3 and class counsel satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a).  Their primary argument is that\n4 certification under Rule 23(b)(3) would be improper because individual issues predominate\n5 over common issues and a class action would therefore not be a superior mechanism for\n6 adjudicating the controversies at issue.2\n7 Some courts have denied class certification in similar cases for these reasons.  For\n8 example, plaintiffs in an Iowa case sought “certification of a class defined as all persons\n9 arrested on a serious misdemeanor charge and strip searched pursuant to the defendant\n10 county jail’s across-the-board strip search policy during a twenty-one month period prior to a\nt\nr 11 change in the policy.”  Rattray v. Woodbury County, 253 F.R.D. 444, 447 (N.D. Iowa 2008). \nu\no\na\nC ni 12 The district judge concluded that certification of a Rule 23(b)(3) class was “not appropriate\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 because, in this court’s view, class questions do not predominate over individual questions,\nDis strict  14 and, for essentially that same reason, a class action is not superior to other methods of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 adjudicating the controversy.”  Id. at 465.  Other district courts have reached similar\nS N\ned  or the  16 conclusions.  E.g., Bledsoe v. Combs, Case No. NA 99-153-C H/G, 2000 WL 681094, at *5\nt F\ni 17 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 14, 2000); Doe v. Connecticut, Case No. 3:00cv2036 (PCD) (D. Conn.),\nn\nU\n18 Sept. 26, 2002 Order at 8-9 (Ex. 1 to Defs.’ App. of Unpublished Cases) (also noting that it\n19 “is conceded that the [strip search] policy is not uniformly applied”); Doe v. City & County\n20 of San Francisco, Case No. C04-4914 MJJ (N.D. Cal.), Nov. 29, 2006 Order at 5-7 (finding\n21 that the proposed class was not ascertainable, and that the requirements Rule 23(a) were not\n22 satisfied, in part because “membership [in the class] is contingent on the searches being\n23 conducted without probable cause or reasonable suspicion” and “[t]o determine whether a\n24 minor arrested during the proposed period qualifies for membership in [the] class, the Court\n25 would have to engage in a case-by-case examination of the specific circumstances of the\n26 minor’s arrest, and whether the Defendants had a valid basis to perform the search”).\n27\n2Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ original proposed class definition is overbroad. \n28 The Court addresses this argument in more detail below.\n  5\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page6 of 9\n1 However, as the Rattray court itself noted, its decision was “against the weight of\n2 authority granting class certification in strip-search cases.”  Rattray, 253 F.R.D. at 465. \n3 Indeed, citing two federal appellate court decisions and twelve district court decisions, the\n4 court observed that “other courts have uniformly certified Rule 23(b)(3) classes in strip-\n5 search cases over objections like those that the County raises here.”  Id. at 461-62.  At least\n6 three other decisions, two from this district, granting class certification in strip-search cases\n7 have been brought to this Court’s attention: Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n8 2004); Gallagher v. County of San Mateo, Case No. C04-0448 SBA (N.D. Cal.), Oct. 31,\n9 2005 Order (Ex. B to Merin Decl.); Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, Case No.\n10 C03-1840 CRB (N.D. Cal.), June 10, 2004 Mem. & Order (Ex. A to Merin Decl.). \nt\nr 11 Defendants’ contention that there is a “recent trend of federal courts rejecting certification\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 under Rule 23(b)(3),” Opp’n at 12-13, is simply incorrect.  To the contrary, this Court finds\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 that the great weight of authority supports certifying Plaintiffs’ proposed class.\nDis strict  14 Plaintiffs here challenge the constitutionality of a blanket strip search policy that did\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 not require any evaluation of individualized reasonable suspicion.  See, e.g., Pliler Dep. at\nS N\ned  or the  16 21:5-28:6 (Ex. D to Merin Decl.) (except for inmates falling within certain categories, such\nt F\ni 17 as individuals who were being cite-released or those on two-day commitments, strip\nn\nU\n18 searching was “part of the process to house people”); Ellison Dep. at 13:11-14:14 (Ex. E to\n19 Merin Decl.) (under the policy at issue in this case, all individuals who were to be housed\n20 pending arraignment were strip-searched).  The legality of that policy, as well as whether\n21 individualized reasonable suspicion is a defense to liability or a limitation on damages, are\n22 common issues that predominate in this case.\n23 The Court agrees with the district court in Bull, which explained that:\n24 those that were subjected to searches based on individualized\nreasonable suspicion are not included in the class.  The issue of\n25 whether a post hoc determination of reasonable suspicion is\nsufficient to avoid a constitutional violation will not be addressed\n26 at this time.  Nonetheless, even if there is a post hoc\ndetermination of reasonable suspicion, that does not mean that an\n27 individual was not searched pursuant to a blanket visual body\ncavity strip search, the constitutionality of which will be\n28 determined in this litigation.\n  6\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page7 of 9\n1 Bull, June 10, 2004 Mem. & Order at 11.  As in Bull, “defendants acknowledge that there\n2 was a . . . policy in place regarding strip searches, and it is this policy that plaintiffs\n3 challenge.  Thus, it is a fair guess that most arrestees were searched on that basis. . . .  [A]ny\n4 potential individualized issues can be addressed later in the litigation and do not defeat class\n5 certification.”  Id.  Moreover, some issues that Defendants contend are individualized issues\n6 – for example, “what crimes constitute an excludable crime involving violence, weapons, or\n7 drugs” and “whether persons arrested on out of county warrants or for probation violations\n8 [fall] outside the class,” Opp’n at 16 – appear to be issues that can and should be resolved on\n9 a class-wide basis.  See id. at 11-12 (noting that “numerous questions” remained to be\n10 resolved, but explaining that “whatever is decided on those issues [] would seemingly affect\nt\nr 11 all class members”); Merin Reply Decl. ¶ 7 (discussing post-certification resolution of issues\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 on a class-wide basis in Moyle v. County of Contra Costa).  The Court is also convinced that\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 membership in the class can, in the vast majority of cases, be easily ascertained by reference\nDis strict  14 to computerized records and file notations.  While individualized inquiries may be necessary\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 in some cases, these inquiries appear neither to predominate nor to be unmanageable.\nS N\ned  or the  16 Accordingly, this Court concludes that common issues predominate over individualized\nt F\ni 17 issues, and that a class action – at least at the liability stage of the proceedings – would be\nn\nU\n18 manageable and superior to individual actions. \n19 Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ original proposed class definition is\n20 overbroad.  Plaintiffs agree with the majority of Defendants’ arguments and suitably\n21 amended their proposed class definition on reply.  Plaintiffs did not agree to exclude one\n22 category of individuals that Defendants asserted must be excluded – individuals with “arrests\n23 in connection with out-of-county arrest warrants or transfers to Contra Costa County Jail\n24 from other Counties’ detention centers,” Opp’n at 21 – and this Court agrees that no such\n25 exclusion is warranted at this time.  Although this category was excluded from a class\n26 certified in another strip search case, the plaintiffs in that case agreed that the exception was\n27 “generally reasonable.”  Moyle v. County of Contra Costa, Case No. C05-2324, 2007 WL\n28 4287315, at *22 n.13 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2007).  Defendants have not persuaded the Court\n  7\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page8 of 9\n1 that, absent such agreement, this exclusion is required.  However, this is not a definitive\n2 ruling on the propriety of including such individuals in the class; instead, the Court finds\n3 only that this is a disputed issue that, as noted above, can and should be resolved on a class-\n4 wide basis.\n5\n6 CONCLUSION\n7 In light of all of the above, the Court finds class certification to be appropriate and\n8 hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ second motion for class certification.  Defendants do not dispute\n9 that the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) are satisfied, and the Court\n10 rejects Defendants’ objections to the suitability of certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \nt\nr 11 Pursuant to Plaintiffs’ revised proposed class definition, the following class is hereby\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 certified:\n  or\nct alif\nDistri strict of C 1134 ADcolemlf eppneldriasaonnnctess’,  w spiirntihoc ert  hcOeu csltatoowbm eo ran 2n J0du,  pn2oe0 l01ic2, y,2  a0wn0ad3s , c boorrno stuiugnchuhti  noignth tuoenrt milore\ntates  orthern Di 15 roceoncn eatnnroty ld lmeadties s dwuebmhsetenaa nnthcoeers  po, oro lrli ecfseysl eowrn acysh  viamirogpleel ennmcoete, n iantnevddo, l wvwihnhogo   wwweeerareep oanrrse,sted\nS N\ned  or the  16 sbuobdjye cctaevdi ttyo  sae uarncihfo(erms)  abnyd d ienfdeinsdcarinmtsi nbaetfeo r(eb laarnrkaeigt)n mstreinpt/ vaits tuhael\nt F\ni 17 Contra Costa County Jails without any individualized reasonable\nn\nU suspicion that they were concealing contraband.  This class may\n18 also include arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket\nstrip searches before arraignment after the initial strip search,\n19 without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had\nsubsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.\n20\nAlso excluded from the class are those otherwise eligible\n21 arrestees who (1) have a history of at least one prior conviction or\ntwo prior arrests for excludable offenses within the last five\n22 years; (2) have a current probation condition which includes\nconsent to search; (3) upon arrest or detention, exhibit behavior\n23 or circumstances indicating they may be a danger to\nhimself/herself or others; [or] (4) are strip searched after\n24 arraignment.\n25 In addition, the Court has considered the criteria listed under Rule 23(g) and hereby appoints\n26 the Law Offices of Mark E. Merin and Casper, Meadows, Schwartz & Cook as class counsel.\n27 Because the Court has certified a class under Rule 23(b)(3), it must also “direct to class\n28 members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual\n  8\n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document172   Filed11/03/09   Page9 of 9\n1 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort,” and such notice must\n2 include all of the information required by Rule 23(c)(2)(B).

RUPF, Individually and\n2 in His Official Capacity, CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES sued under their\n3 fictitious names as DOES 1 THROUGH 100, and ROES 1 THROUGH 20, for violations of\n4 plaintiff’s constitutional rights resulting from application of CONTRA COSTA County’s and the\n5 Sheriff’s policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches and visual body\n6 cavity searches in CONTRA COSTA County Jails.  Plaintiffs seek an order declaring illegal\n7 defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches\n8 before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be\n9 productive of contraband. \n10 Defendants’ strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs\n11 violate those rights of plaintiffs, and all those they represent, that are secured by the Fourth and\n12 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and entitle plaintiffs, and all those\n13 similarly situated, to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n14 Additionally, plaintiffs include, on behalf of themself and on behalf of all those they\n15 represent, supplemental claims under California state law against defendants: 1) for violation of\n16 California  Penal  Code  §  4030  which  prohibits  pre-arraignment  strip  searches  of  most\n17 misdemeanants and provides for minimum damages of $1,000 for each illegal search; and 2) for\n18 violation of the Bane Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b)) pursuant to\n19 which  plaintiffs  and  each  similarly  situated  person  denied  a  statutory,  state,  federal,  or\n20 constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each violation.\n21 JURISDICTION\n22 This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n23 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC\n24 §§ 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n25 1. Under 28 USC § 1367(a) the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state\n26 claims alleged herein.\n27 2. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n28 \\\\\\\nPage 2 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 3 of 14(cid:10)\n1 PARTIES\n2 3. Plaintiffs ROSALETY BARNETT, PETER MORGANELLI, and all those similarly\n3 situated, are, and at all material times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of\n4 the state of California who were arrested within the period beginning two (2) years before the filing\n5 of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body\n6 cavity searches at a CONTRA COSTA County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the “CONTRA\n7 COSTA County Jail”), prior to being arraigned and/or without the defendants first having, and\n8 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband\n9 or weapons.\n10 4. Defendants coerced, forced, and compelled plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT to\n11 give a urine sample without legal justification for requiring same.  Moreover, defendants coerced,\n12 forced, and compelled plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT to give a urine sample in an area of the\n13 CONTRA COSTA County Jail that was not sufficiently private so as to prevent persons not\n14 participating in the collection of the sample from observing the collection.  Furthermore,\n15 defendants required plaintiff to provide the urine sample while being directly observed by\n16 defendants’ male and female officers.\n17 5. Defendant CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF WARREN E. RUPF is, and at\n18 all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the COUNTY OF CONTRA\n19 COSTA,  responsible  for  administering  the  Jail  facilities  and  for  making,  overseeing,  and\n20 implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of\n21 the CONTRA COSTA County Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n22 6. Defendants CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by\n23 their fictitious names (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the\n24 CONTRA  COSTA  County  Jail,  subjected  plaintiffs,  and  all  those  they  represent,  to  pre-\n25 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a\n26 reasonable  suspicion  that  the  searches  would  be  productive  of  contraband  or  weapons. \n27 Furthermore, Defendants CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n28 fictitious names (Does 1 through 5) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the CONTRA\nPage 3 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 4 of 14(cid:10)\n1 COSTA County Jail, coerced, forced, and compelled plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT to give a\n2 urine sample in a non-private setting and without proper justification.\n3 7. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n4 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\n5 of the state of California, the COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA and/or the CONTRA COSTA\n6 COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT. \n7 8. Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious\n8 names of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the other named\n9 defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated with the\n10 implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to strip searches complained of herein.\n11 9. Defendant COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA is, and at all material times referred\n12 to herein, was a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy\n13 or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of\n14 herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.\n15 Plaintiffs’ allegations against the COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and\n16 his DEPUTIES and on acts and omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the\n17 COUNTY’s breach of its duty to protect plaintiffs, and all those they represent, from the wrongful\n18 conduct of said persons and employees.\n19 10. Defendants  CONTRA  COSTA  COUNTY  SHERIFF’S  DEPARTMENT  and\n20 CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF WARREN E. RUPF, in his Individual and Official\n21 Capacity, also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the\n22 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs, and all\n23 those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  \n24 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n25 two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were subjected by\n26 defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having,\n27 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n28 contraband or weapons.  \nPage 4 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\n1 FACTS\n2 12. On or about March 1, 2004, plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT (hereinafter referred\n3 to as “plaintiff”) was falsely arrested for allegedly resisting arrest.  Plaintiff was taken to the\n4 CONTRA COSTA County Jail in Martinez, California, where she was coerced, forced, and\n5 compelled to produce a urine sample while being directly observed by male deputies (DOES 1 and\n6 5).\n7 13. Plaintiff, like all those she represents, was also forced to disrobe completely in front\n8 of a deputy who directed plaintiff to bend over, squat, and cough and to spread her buttocks and\n9 labia so that her vaginal and anal cavities could be visual inspected.\n10 14. Within six (6) months of the aforesaid visual body cavity search, plaintiff filed a\n11 group Government Tort Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said\n12 claim is attached hereto as Exhibit “A”, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this\n13 reference).  Plaintiff’s group claim was denied on or about September 14, 2004, allowing the filing\n14 of this class action complaint on state statute and constitutional violations as well as for her\n15 individual claim relating to the unjustified urine collection.\n16 15. Plaintiff PETER MORGANELLI was arrested in CONTRA COSTA COUNTY on\n17 or about December 3, 2002, on a charge not involving violence, drugs or weapons, and transported\n18 to the Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez, California, where, prior to arraignment, pursuant to\n19 defendants’ blanket, indiscriminate strip search policy, practice, and custom, he was forced entirely\n20 to disrobe and to expose for inspection his buttocks and genitalia without defendants having\n21 reasonable suspicion that he was concealing contraband or weapons and without a supervisor\n22 approving the strip search in writing.\n23 16. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants routinely\n24 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including\n25 plaintiffs, and all those they represent, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having,\n26 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband\n27 or weapons.  \n28 \\\\\\\nPage 5 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 6 of 14(cid:10)\n1 17. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have the\n2 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’\n3 custody, at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing of this\n4 Complaint, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n5 without defendants having first, and recording, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n6 productive of contraband or weapons.\n7 18. Defendant  CONTRA  COSTA  COUNTY  SHERIFF  WARREN  E.  RUPF  is\n8 personally responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice,\n9 and custom pursuant to which plaintiffs, and those they represent, were subjected. \n10 19. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiffs,\n11 and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress,\n12 invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and\n13 constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum,\n14 $1,000 each as specified in California Penal Code § 4030(p) and $4,000 each as specified in\n15 California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n16 20. As a result of being unjustifiably coerced, forced, and compelled to provide a urine\n17 sample and to do so while being directly observed by male deputies of the CONTRA COSTA\n18 County Jail as complained of herein, plaintiff BARNETT suffered physical, mental, and emotional\n19 distress and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights,\n20 and is entitled to recover damages according to proof, but a minimum of $4,000 as specified in\n21 California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n22 CLASS CLAIMS\n23 21. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs, and all those similarly\n24 situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants\n25 CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF WARREN E. RUPF, CONTRA COSTA COUNTY\n26 SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, the individual SHERIFF’S\n27 DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 100, and the individuals whose names\n28 are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20.  The searches\nPage 6 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 7 of 14(cid:10)\n1 complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which\n2 plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not\n3 plaintiffs, or those they represent, were eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6,\n4 without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, were eligible for\n5 and/or were released on his or her own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of\n6 herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs, or any of\n7 those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, and those facts being\n8 articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document. \n9 22. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n10 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n11 23. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n12 two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated\n13 and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment\n14 strip and/or visual body cavity search at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail without defendants\n15 first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive\n16 of contraband or weapons.\n17 24. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of\n18 the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the\n19 exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n20 there are more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of\n21 defendants and subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy,\n22 practice, and custom relating to said searches.  \n23 25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n24 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the\n25 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to\n26 visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the\n27 CONTRA COSTA County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches\n28 prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable\nPage 7 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 8 of 14(cid:10)\n1 facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily\n2 cavities which could be detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual\n3 body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed\n4 by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n5 reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and\n6 whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n7 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n8 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the\n9 class including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n10 searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\n11 articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed drugs, weapons\n12 and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether\n13 defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating\n14 the use of the visual body cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n15 of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether\n16 visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people\n17 not participating in the search without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights\n18 and plaintiffs’ State statutory rights; (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n19 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution; (5) whether or not plaintiffs’\n20 claims under Penal Code § 4030 are barred by the provisions of Government Code § 844.6; and,\n21 (6) whether or not defendants have an immunity defense to plaintiffs’ claims under Civil Code §§\n22 52 and 52.1, and  whether or not those claims are actionable in a class action. \n23 27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n24 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment,\n25 without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity searches would produce drugs,\n26 weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in\n27 a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the\n28 same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’\nPage 8 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\n1 policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\n2 before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\n3 searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual\n4 damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search.  The actual damages suffered\n5 by the representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by\n6 each class member.  \n7 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n8 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent\n9 with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n10 29. In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(A),\n11 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that\n12 inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would\n13 establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.  \n14 30. In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(B),\n15 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of\n16 inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a\n17 practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to\n18 protect their interests.\n19 31. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n20 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n21 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n22 respect to the class as a whole.  \n23 32. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n24 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n25 between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests\n26 of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in\n27 that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs also\n28 are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so\nPage 9 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 04-04437 TEH\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 28-1     Filed 08/11/2005     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\n1 small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n2 thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.\n3 Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all\n4 litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the CONTRA\n5 COSTA County Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law\n6 and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.  \n7 33. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are\n8 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be\n9 ascertained from records maintained by the COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA and defendant\n10 SHERIFF  WARREN  E.  RUPF  and  defendant  CONTRA  COSTA  COUNTY  SHERIFF’S\n11 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’\n12 records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have\n13 been held in custody in the CONTRA COSTA County Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n14 and thereupon allege, that records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a\n15 strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred,\n16 whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved\n17 writing, when persons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were\n18 arrested.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing\n19 information is contained in defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to\n20 identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests\n21 and/or release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.  \n22 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n23 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual\n24 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n25 believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for\n26 class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at\n27 such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class\n28 members of the following:\nPage 10 of 14\nROSALETY BARNETT, et al. v. COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, et al.

Defendants join in this application in direct reliance on the Representations and Warranties \n6 set forth by Plaintiff and her counsel in the Settlement Agreement, the Declaration of Mark Merin, Esq. \n7 submitted herewith, and pursuant to Defendants’ obligations to cooperate in good faith with Plaintiff and \n8 her counsel under Section 4(C) of the Settlement Agreement. \n9 I.  BACKGROUND \n10  This case was originally filed on October 20, 2004, by Rosalety Barnett on behalf of herself and \n11 an alleged putative class of persons similarly situated who were strip searched at Contra Costa jail \n12 facilities after being arrested on crimes not involving violence, drugs, or weapons.  When it was \n13 determined that Ms. Barnett was strip searched after the defendant county changed its policies, Ms. \n14 Barnett was replaced as class proposed class representative by Peter Morganelli.  Since Mr. Morganelli \n15 was arrested for a felony and the Court ruled that the complaint did not include felony offenses, Mr. \n16 Morganelli was replaced by Adeline Chan as proposed class representative, and the class certified to \n17 include all persons who were arrested on misdemeanor or lesser charges not involving weapons, \n18 controlled substances or felony violence and who were subjected to blanket strip searches, before \n19 arraignment at the Contra Costa County jail without reasonable suspicion between October 20, 2002, and \n20 June 1, 2003.  The class also included all arrestees “subjected to subsequent blanket strip searches before \n21 arraignment after the initial strip search, without any reasonable individual suspicion that they had \n22 subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.”   \n23 On February 9, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal in Bull v. San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 \n24 (9th Cir. 2010), modified the law on which this Court had relied to certify the class herein and to deny \n25 the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and upheld the blanket strip search of persons classified \n26 for housing as related to legitimate jail safety measures.  As a result of that Ninth Circuit ruling, the \n27 Court entered a Stipulated Order dismissing all of Chan’s claim and most of the Misdemeanor Class’ \n28 federal Fourth Amendment claims, exempting from dismissal the claims of women misdemeanor \n2 \nJOINT APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nBarnett, et al. v. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 04-4437 TEH   \n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document213   Filed03/15/11   Page3 of 6\n \n1 arrestees who alleged that they were subjected to additional or “secondary” visual body searches during \n2 their transfer from Contra Costa Martinez Detention Facility to Contra Costa West County Detention \n3 Facility.   \n4 Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint and substituted Vanessa Hunt as an individual and \n5 representative Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated who alleged that they were \n6 subjected to a secondary strip search after having been arrested on a misdemeanor charge not involving \n7 violence, drugs, or weapons, when they had no opportunity to obtain contraband after having been \n8 subjected to an initial strip search.  Defendants filed another motion for summary judgment on the \n9 remaining secondary search claims and, after determining that there were too few potential class \n10 members to qualify for class certification, Plaintiff notified the Court and counsel that it would not seek \n11 certification of the Hunt secondary search claims.   \n12 Thereafter, the parties initiated settlement discussions which have been concluded and, if the \n13 proposed settlement which has been approved by the parties is approved by the Court, it will finally end \n14 this marathon litigation. \n15 II.  PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n16 The Proposed Settlement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, provides that the defendant \n17 County will pay to Plaintiff Hunt the sum of $19,999.00, to be shared with any other similarly situated \n18 persons who executed retainer agreements with Plaintiff’s counsel, and the Plaintiff, in return, will file a \n19 request for a dismissal of the action, with prejudice.  Pursuant to Section 2 of the Settlement Agreement, \n20 Plaintiff’s counsel will have sole responsibility for holding, determining eligibility for, and administering \n21 any settlement proceeds to any clients and/or putative or actual Plaintiffs, including and in addition to \n22 Hunt.  \n23 According to the declaration of Mark E. Merin, filed herewith, Plaintiff, through discovery, \n24 determined that there were only eight (8) women who were potentially similarly situated and made \n25 repeated attempts to contact them to see if they would like to join the action. Counsel was able to contact \n26 two (2) of those women; one, Vanessa Hunt, is the present Plaintiff; the other recorded that she was \n27 arrested on a disqualifying charge and is therefore not a proper class member.  Accordingly, Vanessa  \n28 \\\\\\ \n3 \nJOINT APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nBarnett, et al. v. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 04-4437 TEH   \n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document213   Filed03/15/11   Page4 of 6\n \n1 Hunt, therefore, is the only Plaintiff who will share in this settlement and she has read and signed the \n2 Settlement Agreement and General Release which is attached hereto.   \n3 III.  THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO NOTICE SHOULD BE REQUIRED \n4 Rule 23(e)(1)(A) requires the Court to “approve any settlement, voluntary dismissal, or \n5 compromise of the claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class.” Subpart (1)(B) requires the Court to \n6 “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by a proposed \n7 settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise.” Although it might appear that court approval and notice \n8 are mandatory on dismissal or compromise of a class suit, the authors of Newberg on Class Actions, 4th \n9 Edition, ' 11:66, observe that: \n10 . . . on closer analysis, notice is not mandatory in all instances but “shall be \ngiven to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.”  \n11 Broadly interpreted, this language is sufficiently flexible to permit the court \nto approve a dismissal or compromise by the named plaintiff individually, \n12 but to determine that no class notice at all is required, when the dismissal \nor compromise will not result in any prejudice to the class.  Thus, generally \n13 speaking, while notice to the class will effectuate the policies behind the \nrule, judicial discretion is permitted for withholding notice in instances \n14 when notice would issue unnecessarily or force the court to employ \nunneeded alternative methods to circumvent the policy when dismissal of \n15 the class litigation is otherwise proper. \n16 (4 Newberg on Class Actions ' 11:66.) \n17 This is an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion by not requiring notice to be \n18 given of the proposed stipulated settlement for the following reasons: \n19 1.  No class has been certified and, indeed, there are only six (6) potential person who might \n20 be similarly situated to Ms. Hunt, but diligent efforts have failed to result in contact with such potential \n21 plaintiffs.  In the absence of any way to contact such potential plaintiffs, the parties are unable to give \n22 notice to those persons.   \n23 2.  Settlement of Ms. Hunt’s case is not res judicata for any other claim; no one is foreclosed \n24 from bringing an individual action as a result of this proposed settlement. To the contrary, if there are \n25 other persons who could bring an action as a result of being subjected to secondary strip searches at \n26 Contra Costa County Jail, the running of the statute of limitations on any such claims has been and will \n27 be tolled until the dismissal of Ms. Hunt’s complaint. Since no notices have gone out advising persons of \n28 the filing of Ms. Hunt’s claim, it is unlikely that there are any putative Plaintiffs who are relying on Ms. \n4 \nJOINT APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nBarnett, et al. v. Contra Costa County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. C 04-4437 TEH   \n\nCase3:04-cv-04437-TEH   Document213   Filed03/15/11   Page5 of 6\n \n1 Hunt to continue to litigate a class claim on their behalf. Thus it is unlikely that any persons will or could \n2 be prejudiced by the settlement of Ms. Hunt’s complaint.  \n3 3.  If notice were required to be given, it would have to be given to six (6) women who had \n4 been subjected to a secondary strip search after having been arrested on a misdemeanor charge not \n5 involving violence, drugs, or weapons, when they had no opportunity to obtain contraband after having \n6 been subjected to an initial strip search.  Plaintiff has already attempted to locate these six (6) women \n7 using expensive on-line database searches, but has been able to locate only two (2) of the women:  one, \n8 Ms. Hunt, and another whose arrest charges made her an unqualified plaintiff.  The additional expense of \n9 attempting to locate the remaining six (6) women is not justified considering the difficulty of establishing \n10 liability and damages.   \n11 While generally notice to class members is given when an action filed or certified as a class \n12 action is proposed for or has been settled, in this case there is no class of women similarly situated to \n13 Vanessa Hunt, and only six (6) other women who may have been arrested on misdemeanor charges, not \n14 involving violence, drugs, or weapons and strip searched, before arraignment, then transferred to Contra \n15 Costa West County Detention Facility and strip searched a second time, before arraignment, without \n16 having had the opportunity to receive contraband following the first strip search.   \n17 Accordingly, Plaintiff requests (and Defendants are not aware of any basis to object to) the Court \n18 issue an order approving the settlement without ordering that notice be given of the settlement to any \n19 persons who might claim that they should share in the settlement funds since efforts to locate the few \n20 women who might, conceivably, be similarly situated to Ms. Hunt, have been unsuccessful. \n21 DATED: March 15, 2011      Respectfully submitted, \n \n22               LAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

A. \n19\nDiscovery revealed that before June 1, 2003, the County had a blanket policy of\n20\nindiscriminately strip searching all arrestees slated for housing prior to arraignment.  After\n21\nJune 1, 2003, however, the County had a written policy requiring that all strip searches be\n22\nbased on reasonable suspicion, and setting out procedures for documenting that suspicion\n23\nbefore strip searches were performed.   \n24\nNewly aware that Barnett herself (arrested in 2004) was not searched pursuant to the\n25\nblanket policy, Plaintiffs sought to amend the Complaint to add a new plaintiff who had been\n26\nstrip searched under the blanket policy.  In July, 2005, Plaintiffs moved to amend the\n27\nComplaint to add Peter Morganelli, who was strip searched on December 3, 2002.  Plaintiffs\n28\n  2\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 3 of 10 \n1 represented that Morganelli, who had been arrested for drunk driving, was a member of the\n2 original class of plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend Class Action Complaint, filed July\n3 19, 2005, at 3:23-24.  The Court granted leave to amend, and the Amended Complaint was\n4 filed on August 11, 2005.  \n5 Defendants moved to dismiss Morganelli’s claims.  They argued that his state law\n6 claims were barred by his failure to comply with California’s Tort Claims Act.  Plaintiffs,\n7 without admitting that Morganelli had no claims under Cal. Penal Code § 4030 because he\n8 was arrested for felony DUI, did not oppose this portion of the motion.  \n9 In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants also argued Morganelli’s § 1983 claim was\n10 time-barred.  Plaintiffs countered that Morganelli was “undisputably a member of the class\n11 on whose behalf the action was originally filed,” because he was a “person arrested in Contra\nt\nr\nu\no 12 Costa County for minor crimes not involving drugs, weapons, or violence” and strip searched\nC\n \nt 13 under a blanket strip search policy.

Utah, 414 U.S. 538 (1974).  Order, October 31, 2005, at 3-4.\nUnit or the 18 Plaintiffs moved for class certification in June, 2006.   With Peter Morganelli as the\nF\n19 sole class representative, they sought certification of a class consisting of\n20 “All persons, since October 20, 2002, and continuing until Defendants’ prior custom\nand policy was brought into compliance with the law on June 1, 2003, or such other\n21 more recent date when the policy was implemented, who were arrested on any charge\n(including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled substances, or felony violence,\n22 and who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body\ncavity search(es) by defendants before arraignment at the Contra Costa County Jails\n23 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing\ncontraband.  This class may include arrestees who were subjected to subsequent\n24 blanket strip searches before arraignment after the initial strip search, without any\nreasonable individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden\n25 contraband on their persons.”   \n26 (Emphasis in original). \n27 With their opposition to the class certification motion, the Defendants moved to strike\n28 the felony arrest plaintiffs from the class definition in Plaintiffs’ motion for class\n  3\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 4 of 10 \n1 certification, or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment on all claims asserted on\n2 behalf of the putative felony arrest plaintiffs.\n3\nDISCUSSION\n4\nI. The Complaint Did Not Include Felony Arrestees\n5\nRead as a whole, the class action Complaint filed on October 20, 2004 was brought on\n6\nbehalf of only misdemeanor arrestees.  \n7\nThe language of the Complaint’s class definition does not distinguish between persons\n8\narrested for misdemeanors and felonies.  The Complaint was brought on behalf of \n9\nall persons who ... were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual\n10 body cavity search at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail without defendants first\nhaving, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be\n11 productive of contraband or weapons.\nt\nr\nu\no 12 Complaint, ¶ 22.   The Complaint alleges that the searches complained of were performed\nC\n \nt 13 “without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiff, and all those similarly\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 situatedIf,  hthaids  bweeerne  athrree sotneldy  .r..e.”le  vIadn. t¶  l2an0g. u age in the Complaint, an expansive reading of the\nate Distri\n St hern 16 class definition might be warranted.  It is not.  The Complaint also states that each member of\ned Nort17 the class has a claim under Cal. Penal Code § 4030, which provides (with some exceptions)\nUnit or the 18 that strip searches of persons arrested for infractions and misdemeanors must be supported\nF\n19 by reasonable suspicion.  (Third Cause of Action, Complaint ¶ 36, alleging violation of \n20 § 4030 “on behalf of Plaintiffs and all persons similarly situated” and seeking damages under\n21 § 4030(p) on their behalf).  The Complaint alleges that legal questions under § 4030 are\n22 “common to the class,” Complaint ¶ 25 (emphasis added).  It seeks damages for the entire\n23 class under the California statute.  Id., Prayer for Relief ¶ 6.   Moreover, the Complaint\n24 alleges that the searches were performed “without regard to whether or not plaintiff, or those\n25 she represents, was eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6,” a statute\n26 involving citations for misdemeanors.  \n27 The language of the complaint must be construed as a whole.   Kasishke v. Keppler,\n28 158 F.2d 809, 811 (10th Cir. 1947).  The Complaint asserts a claim applicable only to\n  4\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 5 of 10 \n1 misdemeanor arrestees on behalf of every class member.  Misdemeanor arrestees are not a\n2 subset of the class; they are the class.  \n3 Moreover, in various briefs before this Court, Plaintiffs have characterized their\n4 claims as involving individuals arrested on “minor charges” or for “minor offenses.”  See,\n5 e.g., Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend Complaint, filed July 19, 2005, at 2 (plaintiff brought class\n6 action “on behalf of herself and all other persons arrested in Contra Costa County for minor\n7 crimes not involving drugs, violence, or weapons...”); Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion to\n8 Dismiss, filed September 26, 2005, at 1 (“minor offense not involving drugs, weapons, or\n9 violence”).   Statements in briefs can be treated as judicial admissions that bind a party. \n10 Gospel Missions of America v. City of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 2003).1 \n11 Moreover, defendants rely particularly on representations that a plaintiff is not suing on a\nt\nr\nu\no 12 particular claim.  See, e.g., Sarro v. City of Sacramento, 78 F.Supp.2d 1057, 1061 (E.D.Cal.\nC\n \nt 13 1999) and cases cited therein.  Plaintiffs are bound to their characterization of the case as one\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 iwnevaoplvoinnsg,  opre rvsioonlesn acrer.e  sted for  “minor crimes” or “minor offenses” not involving drugs,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 In the context of this case, “minor crimes” or “minor offenses” do not include\ned Nort17 felonies.  Defendants argue that “minor offense” is a term of art that excludes felonies.  See,\nUnit or the 18 e.g., Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 716 n.8 (9th Cir. 1990)\nF\n19 (distinguishing “felonies” and “minor offenses” in the strip search context), Thompson v.\n20 County of Cook, 428 F.Supp.2d 807, 812 (N.D.Ill., 2006)(equating “minor offenses” with\n21 “misdemeanor or traffic offenses”).   Plaintiffs counter that in strip search jurisprudence, the\n22 Court’s constitutional inquiry turns on the nature of the crime charged, rather than the\n23 felony/misdemeanor distinction, see Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714-16; see also Murcia v. County\n24 of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d 489, 495 (S.D.N.Y.,2002), citing Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714, so\n25 plaintiffs’ phrase “minor offense not involving drugs, weapons, or violence” should be\n26\n27\n1   Plaintiffs’ objection to the Court’s consideration of statements in Plaintiffs’ own briefs is\n28 OVERRULED.\n  5\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 6 of 10 \n1 viewed as shorthand that could include a class of cases potentially including both felonies\n2 and misdemeanors.   \n3 Defendants have the better argument.  While there are some cases which use the word\n4 “minor” to refer to felonies, see, e.g., Rodriguez-Herrera v. I.N.S., 52 F.3d 238, 239 (9th Cir.\n5 1995)(class C felony referred to as “minor offense”), far more distinguish between “minor\n6 offenses” and “felonies.”  Moreover, the Court is swayed  by the fact that Kennedy itself uses\n7 the terms as if they were mutually exclusive.  See, Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714-716.  Plaintiffs\n8 cannot ask the Court to look to the reasoning of Kennedy, but to overlook its explicit use of\n9 the very terms at issue.  In the context of this litigation, “minor offense” means a\n10 misdemeanor or lesser offense. \n11 Finally, Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(f) instructs the Court to construe the Complaint so “as to\nt\nr\nu\no 12 do substantial justice.”  Although this Rule ordinarily requires the Court to construe\nC\n \nt 13 pleadings liberally, that is not the case if a liberal construction would prejudice the defendant\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 bLeucnaduys ev .t hAed apmleaard ionfg N feawile Jde tros egyi,v Ien tch.,e 3 d4e Ffe.n3dda 1n1t 7n3o,t i1c1e8 o6f  (w3rhda tC wira. s1 9b9ei4n)g,  qaulloetginedg.  5 S Cehe,a rel.egs.,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1286, at 558-59 (2d ed.\ned Nort17 1990) (“[A]n inadvertent mistake in a pleading will not be held against the pleader if another\nUnit or the 18 party has not been misled by the mistake or otherwise prejudiced.”).  The phrase “substantial\nF\n19 justice” must be given “a practical meaning. ...[T]his does not mean, on the one hand, that the\n20 plaintiff may by pleading, mislead, entrap, surprise or prejudice his adversary, nor on the\n21 other that a party should be permitted to weave a net of artificial refinements and subtle\n22 technicalities in which to catch an unwary litigant.”  Cherry v. Dealers Transport Co.,  64\n23 F.Supp. 682, 683 (D. Mo. 1946).\n24    Here, there are several factors which, although not themselves determinative,\n25 convince the Court that its narrower reading is not only correct but necessary to do\n26 substantial justice.  First, counsel for Plaintiffs have brought other strip-search cases which\n27 distinguished between felony and misdemeanor arrestees.  For example, in Bull v. City and\n28 County of San Francisco, United States District Court for the Northern District of California\n  6\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 7 of 10 \n1 Case No. C-03-1840, plaintiffs (represented by Plaintiffs’ counsel in this case) sought\n2 certification of a subclass of felony and misdemeanor arrestees for federal strip search\n3 claims, and a subclass of misdemeanor arrestees for claims under Penal Code § 4030;  Judge\n4 Breyer granted the motion months before the Complaint in this action was filed. \n5 See Memorandum and Order, filed June 10, 2004, at 8, 12.   Plaintiffs were capable of clearly\n6 alleging a class that included felony arrestees who did not have claims under Penal Code \n7 § 4030 but did not do so. \n8 Second, when Plaintiffs sought information on persons arrested on “charges not\n9 involving drugs, weapons, or violence,” Defendants objected that the phrase “not involving\n10 drugs, weapons, or violence” was vague and ambiguous.   The phrase had been used in\n11 several contexts:  in Interrogatory No. 2, in “charges not involving drugs, weapons, or\nt\nr\nu\no 12 violence,”  in Interrogatory No. 3, “misdemeanors, infractions, or minor offenses not\nC\n \nt 13 involving drugs, weapons, or violence,” and in Interrogatory No. 4, “crimes not involving\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 darrguuges,d w theea pmoenasn, ionrg v wioalse nccleea.”r ,  Isnp ethciefiirc amlloyt iroenfe tror icnogm top ePle dniaslc oCvoedrey   r§e s4p0o3n0s:es, Plaintiffs\nate Distri\n St hern 16 Psternipa ls eCaorcdhee §s ,4 s0p3e0c,i ftihcea lClya lriefoferrnsi ato l apwer rseognusl aatrirnegst hedo won a nchda wrgheesn “ cinovuonltvieisn gc awne caopnodnusc,t\ned Nort17 controlled substances, or violence.”  Cal.

In other words,\n20\nPlaintiffs referred the Defendants to a California statute on misdemeanor arrestees to clarify\n21\nwhat “charges not involving drugs, weapons or violence” meant.  Defendants ultimately\n22\nresponded to the interrogatories by compiling lists of arrestees which eliminated felony\n23\narrests entirely.  See Declaration of Lt. Jacqueline Rubin in Support of Opposition to Motion\n24\nfor Class Certification, ¶¶ 3-7 (Rubin prepared response to Interrrogatory No. 3 by\n25\neliminating felonies); Declaration of Lt. Jacqueline Rubin in Support of Reply to Plaintiffs’\n26\nOpposition to Motion to Strike or for Partial Summary Judgment ¶¶ 2-3 (Rubin prepared\n27\n28\n  7\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 8 of 10 \n1 response to Interrogatory No. 2 by eliminating felonies).2   Defendants were not on notice\n2 that felonies were included in the claims.\n3 It is clear to the Court from the timing of events in this litigation that Plaintiffs are\n4 trying to sweep felony arrestees into the class at this late date to make the class fit the\n5 proposed class representative, rather than vice versa.  The case was originally filed on behalf\n6 of only misdemeanor arrestees. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Strike Putative Felony\n7 Arrest Plaintiffs From The Class Definition is GRANTED.\n8 II. Plaintiff Morganelli’s Claims Are Time-Barred\n9 Plaintiff Morganelli’s claims, added to this case with the Amended Complaint filed\n10 August 11, 2005, are time-barred.3  \n11 The County issued a written strip-search policy on June 1, 2003.  Defendants argue\nt\nr\nu\no 12 that the challenged “blanket” strip-search policy ended on that day, and the statute of\nC\n \nt 13 limitations for any challenge to the blanket strip search policy began to run at that time.  \nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 2003, bPulta cinotniftefsn dac tkhnaot wthlee dstgaet uthtea ts hthoeu lnde wru nw frriottmen t shter idpa steea trhceh p poolliiccyy w waass  aicstsuuaeldly on June 1,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 implemented, and the Court should deny partial summary judgment because Defendants\ned Nort17 failed “to present any proof of the actual termination date of the blanket policy.”  \nUnit or the 18 At the same time, however, Plaintiffs affirmatively argue that the blanket policy ended\nF\n19 on June 1, 2003 in support of their own motion for class certification.   In the context of\n20\n2   Plaintiffs objected to and moved to strike Lt. Rubin’s reply declaration on the\n21 grounds that it was irrelevant, contained inadmissible hearsay, and was improperly filed with\nthe Reply brief rather than in support of the motion itself.  The motion to strike is DENIED.  \n22 The Court is considering Ms. Rubin’s testimony about her own understanding and statements\nnot for the truth the matter, but to show Defendants’ understanding of the claims involved,\n23 and they are relevant to the issue of what reading of the Complaint would serve substantial\njustice.  While the declaration was filed with Defendants’ Reply, the Court finds that the\n24 testimony relating to the County’s understanding of the scope of the class is offered in\nrebuttal to Plaintiff’s Opposition to the motion.  Moreover, Plaintiffs responded with their\n25 own subsequently filed declarations.  See Declaration of Mark E. Merin in Support of Reply\nto Opposition to Plaintiffs' Evidentiary Motion to Strike Affidavits as Untimely Filed, filed\n26 December 22, 2007.   The Court is not considering Ms. Rubin’s account of Mr. Merin’s\nstatements.\n27\n3  The Amended Complaint only explicitly added Morganelli’s claims, and did not\n28 purport to add the claims of some additional class or subclass of felony arrestees. \n  8\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 9 of 10 \n1 arguing Morganelli is an adequate class representative, Plaintiffs alleged that all plaintiffs’\n2 state law claims were time-barred because the blanket strip search policy was discontinued\n3 on June 1, 2003: \n4 Defendants discontinued the blanket strip search policy on or about June 1, 2003;  a\ntort claim to preserve state law claims for strip searches under the blanket policy had\n5 to be filed by January 1, 2004, and, if this deadline was not met, an application for\nrelief from failure to file had to be made within one year, that is, by June 1, 2004.  A\n6 tort claim was filed on behalf of the class by plaintiff Rosalety Barnett on August 9,\n2004,  but it was too late to protect the class’ state law claims for strip searches under\n7 the discontinued blanket policy.  \n8 Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification,\n9 Docket No. 71, at 10:8-16 (citations omitted, emphasis in original).\n10 Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways.   If the statute of limitations started to run for the\n11 state law claims on June 1, 2003, when the policy was discontinued, it started to run on the\nt\nr\nu\no 12 same date for the Fourth Amendment claims.\nC\n \nt 13 The statute of limitations for Morganelli’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is two years.  \nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 MThael dsotantaudteo  tvh.e Hreaforrries ,r a3n7 0o nF .M3da y9 4351,,  925040 5(.9  th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 1725 (2005). \nate Distri\n St hern 16   Morganelli’s claims were added several months later, on August 11, 2005.  If\ned Nort17 Morganelli were a member of the class as alleged in the Complaint, the statute of limitations\nUnit or the 18 on his claims would be tolled from the time the Complaint was filed to the time class\nF\n19 certification is denied.  American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554\n20 (1974); Catholic Social Services v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 1139, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2000).   But\n21 because Morganelli is not a member of the class, the tolling doctrine does not apply.   Nor do\n22 his claims relate back under In re Syntex Corp. Securities Litigation, 95 F.3d 922, 935 (9th\n23 Cir. 1996), because the original Complaint did not give Defendants notice of the claims of\n24 felony arrestees.   His claims are therefore time-barred.  \n25 Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to the sole\n26 felony arrest plaintiff in the case, Peter Morganelli.\n27 //\n28\n  9\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 10 of 10 \n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the reasons set out above, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Strike\n3 Putative Felony Arrest Plaintiffs From The Class Definition, and GRANTS Defendants’\n4 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to plaintiff Morganelli.  Because no proposed class\n5 representative remains, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification without\n6 prejudice. \n7 A further case management conference in both Case No. C-04-4437 and Case No. C-\n8 04-5365 is set for March 19, 2007, at 1:30 p.m. \n9  \n10 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n11\nt\nr\nu\no 12\nC\n \nt 13 Dated: January 24, 2007                                                                           \nc a\ns Distri ct of Californi1145 TUHNEITLETDO NST EA.

In accordance with Fed~al Rules of Civil Proced~e, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is informed\nand believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact commo~a to the class\nincluding, but not limited to: (1) whether defendant.~ routinely subject alI persons arrested to visual\nbody cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the CONTRA\nCOSTA County Jail; (2) whether persons axe subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to\narraigrxmem without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or affordable facts, to\nbelieve any partieular arrestee has Concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities\nwhich could be detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whethe~ the visua.1 body cavity\nsearche~ are conducted in an axea ofpriYacy so ~at the searches caxmot be observed by persons not\nI0 participating in the searches; sad, (4) whether the visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to\n11 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are les~\n12 intrusive methods for protecting any such interest.\n25. in accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffis informed\nand believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to the class\nincluding, but are not Iimhed to: (1) whether defendant~ may perform vi~uaI body cavity searche~ on\npersons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or artieulable facts,\nl? to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband\nwhich would likely be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendar~ts may perform\n~9 visual body cavity searches on persons withoxtt first reasonably relating the use of the visual body\n2O cavity search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the ~ecurity of the jail and determining if\n21’ there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity s catches m~y be\n22 condttdted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without\nviolating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and plaintiffs’ State statutory rights; (4)\n2~ whether or not defendants’ str/p search policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and/or\n2~ Federal Constitution; (5) whether or not plaintiffs’ claims ~nder Per~al Code,§ d.030 are barred by the\n2~ provisions of Government Code § 84,*.6; and, (6) whether or not defendants have an immunity defense\nRO~ALIgTY BARNI~TT. et ~I. v.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), We elaim~ of the\n4 representative plaintiff is t~ical of the class. Plaintiff was searched, prior to arraigtwnent, without\n5 rea~onable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n6 contraband (and without the facts supporting aay such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n7 approved writing). Representative plaintiff’has the same intere~t~ and ~tffered the same type of\n8 injuries a~ all of the class members. Plaintiffs claims arose because of defenders’ policy, practice,\n9 and custom of subjecting arrestees to s~ip and/or visual body cavity searches before arrai~rnent ¯\n10 without havir~g, and recording in writing, a rea~or~abIe suspicion that the search would be productive of\n11 contraband or weapons. Each class member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a\nvisual body cavity search. The actual damages suffered by the representative plaintiffis similar in type\n13 and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class member.\n141 27. In accorda~ace with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\nI5 plaintiffwill fairly and adequately protect the class interests. Plaintiff’s interests are consistent with\nt6 ~d not matagori~tie to the imerests of the elas~.\n17 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecution~ of\n18 separate actions by individual members of the Class would create a risk that i~co~sistent or varying\n19 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n2O of conduct for the.pm’ti.es opposing the complaJm.\n21 29. In accordance with Federal Rules of CiviI Proeedgre, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n22 separate actior~s by individua/members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n23 with respect to individual member~ of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impedr\n24 or impede the interests of the other members of the class }o protect their irnerests.\n25 30. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), pla/ntiffis\n26 informed and believes, aM thereupon alleges, that defendant~ have acted on grounds generally\n\napplicable to the class, thereby malting appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\nrespeqt to the class as a whole.\n31. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23Co)(3), this ela~s action is\nsuperior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\nthe.parties, Pl~in~iff is informed and believe~, and thereupon alIeges, that the intezests of members of\nthe class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate aaion is low, in that most class\nmembers would be unable individually to prosecute any action at a11. Plaindffals0 is informed and\nbelieves, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so sm~/1 that\nsuits would be impracticable. Plmntiffis informed and believes, and thereupon ~lleges, that most\nmembers of the cla~ will not be able to .find counsel to represen~ them. Plaintiffi~informed and,\nbelieves, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation i~ one forum because all\nof the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the CONTRA COSTA County Jail. I~ will promote\njudicial efficiency to resolve the commo~ questions of law and fact in one forum, rather Nan in\n14 multiple cou.rt~.\n32. Plaintiff does not k~ow the identities ofaI1 of the clas~ members. PIail~tiffis informed\n16 and believes, and thereupon allege~, that the identitie~ of the class member~ may\" be ascertained from\n17 records m~,iatained by the COUNTY OF coNrm~_ COSTA and defendant SHERIFF WARREN\nRUPF and defendant CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT. Plaintiffi~\n19 informed and believes, and thereupon allege~, that defendants\" records reflect the identities, including\n~0 addresses and telephone numbers, of the per~on~ who have been held in ¢~stody i~ the CONTRA\nCOSTA County Jails. Plaint/ff is informed aad believes, and thereupon alleges, that record~ of, and\nmaintained by defendants reflect who was subjec~ to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the\nsearch, occ~-t-~ed, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed\nmad was recorded i~ a supervisor-approved waiting, when person~ searched were m-raigned, and the\ncharges on which ~uch persons were arrested. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupo~\nalleges, that at1 of the foregoing information is contained in defendartt~’ computer system and that the\n\ninformation necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and\n2 reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available flom said computer system.\n3 33_ In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23Co)(3), .class members\n4 must be famished with the best notice practicable trader the circumstances, including individual notice\n5 to all m~mbers who can be identified through reasonable effort.

      "text": "1\n2\n3 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n4 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n5\n6\n7 ROSALETY BARNETT, et al.,\nNO. C04-4437 TEH\n8 Plaintiffs,\nORDER GRANTING IN PART\n9 v. AND DENYING IN PART\nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR\n10 COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA, SUMMARY JUDGMENT\net al.,\nt\nr 11\nu\nDefendants.\no\na\nC ni 12\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13\nDis strict  14 This matter comes before the Court on Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 all claims asserted by Plaintiff Adeline Chan.  After carefully reviewing the parties’ written\nS N\ned  or the  16 arguments, the Court finds oral argument to be unnecessary and hereby VACATES the\nt F\ni 17 hearing scheduled for September 21, 2009.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court now\nn\nU\n18 GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’ motion.\n19\n20 BACKGROUND\n21 This case concerns Defendants’ now-discontinued policy of performing strip searches\n22 and visual body cavity searches on all persons arrested and housed prior to arraignment. \n23 Plaintiff Adeline Chan seeks to represent the following class:\n24 All persons, since October 20, 2002, and continuing until\nDefendants’ prior custom and policy was brought into\n25 compliance with the law on June 1, 2003, or such other more\nrecent date when the policy was implemented, who were arrested\n26 on any misdemeanor or lesser charge not involving weapons,\ncontrolled substances, or violence, and who were subjected to a\n27 uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body cavity\nsearch(es) by defendants before arraignment at the Contra Costa\n28 County Jails without any individualized reasonable suspicion that\n \n\n1 they were concealing contraband.  This class may also include\narrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip searches\n2 before arraignment after the initial strip search, without any\nreasonable individualized suspicion that they had subsequently\n3 acquired and hidden contraband on their persons.\n4 Notice of Mot. for Class Cert. at 2.1  In conjunction with their opposition to Plaintiff’s\n5 motion for class certification, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims\n6 asserted by Chan, the sole proposed named plaintiff.  To promote judicial economy, this\n7 Court stayed consideration of Plaintiff’s class certification motion pending resolution of\n8 Defendants’ summary judgment motion.\n9 Chan was arrested twice in 2003 for violating a restraining order that prohibited her\n10 from being within 100 yards of her former employer, Shahzad Saghafi.  On April 19, 2003,\nt\nr 11 Saghafi called the police after observing Chan near his home.  The responding officer\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 interviewed both Chan and Saghafi, viewed the restraining order, and verified that the\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 restraining order had been served.  He then arrested Chan for violating a court order under\nDis strict  14 California Penal Code section 166(a)(4) and transported her to the Martinez Detention\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Facility (“MDF”).\nS N\ned  or the  16 As part of the intake process at MDF, Chan underwent a medical and mental health\nt F\ni 17 history interview.  In response to questions on the Contra Costa Detention Facilities Health\nn\nU\n18 Questionnaire, Chan responded that she was not taking any prescription medication or using\n19 street drugs.  As to her mental health history, Chan stated that she tried to harm herself in\n20 1997 and was a patient at a mental hospital in both 1997 and 2000, but that she did not\n21 currently have problems with depression or mood swings, was not currently receiving\n22 psychiatric treatment, and was not now thinking of harming herself.  Chan explained at her\n23 deposition that her two hospitalizations were three-day involuntary commitments by a doctor\n24\n25 1This class definition appears in both Plaintiff Chan’s notice of motion for class\ncertification and her proposed order.  In the memorandum of points and authorities in support\n26 of her motion, Chan proposes a class that includes individuals “who were arrested on any\nmisdemeanor or lesser charge not involving weapons, controlled substances, or felony\n27 violence.”  Mot. for Class Cert. at 7 (emphasis added).  The inclusion of the word “felony”\nappears to have been in error.  See, e.g., Opp’n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 3 (citing to proposed\n28 class definition in notice of motion, which refers to “violence” and not “felony violence”).\n  2\n\n1 who was treating her for depression, but the record is unclear as to whether this more specific\n2 information was revealed during Chan’s intake interview.\n3 Following review by a registered nurse and a licensed social worker, Chan was\n4 cleared for general population housing.  After waiting at MDF for several hours, Chan was\n5 eventually transported to the West County Detention Facility (“WCDF”).  Upon arrival at\n6 WCDF, Chan was strip searched by a female deputy in a private area.  As Chan explained by\n7 declaration:\n8\nI was taken into a room where I was required to remove all of my\nclothes and, while standing naked in front of a female officer,\n9\nwas directed to perform various maneuvers including stretching\nout my arms so that the officer could look under my arms, and\n10\nlifting my legs so that she could examine the bottom of my feet. \nt She had me run my fingers through my hair and turn around so\nr 11\nu she could examine my back and rear end.  I was then given jail\no a clothes into which I changed.\nC ni 12\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 Chan Decl. in Supp. of Mot. for Class Cert. ¶ 2.  Chan was released on bail two days after\nDis strict  14 her arrest.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 On May 7, 2003, Chan was arrested a second time for violating the terms of a\nS N\ned  or the  16 restraining order against Saghafi.  She was again found near Saghafi’s house, where she\nt F\ni 17 claims she was dropping off court papers, and taken to MDF.  While there, she was subjected\nn\nU\n18 to another strip search by a female officer.  She was held at MDF for two days before being\n19 transferred to WCDF, from where she was released on bail on May 9, 2003.  Chan was never\n20 arraigned on either charge of violating a restraining order.\n21 Chan asserts that the two strip searches to which she was subjected violated both her\n22 federal constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and her state\n23 constitutional right to privacy.  She seeks to represent the proposed class on both of these\n24 claims.  In addition, she seeks to represent the proposed class on a claim based on violation\n25 of California Penal Code section 4030, which was enacted “to protect the state and federal\n26 constitutional rights of the people of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly\n27 limiting strip and body cavity searches.”  Cal. Penal Code § 4030(a).  Defendants have\n28 moved for summary judgment on all of Chan’s claims.\n  3\n\n1 LEGAL STANDARD\n2 Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to material\n3 facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). \n4 Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n5 Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute as to a material fact is “genuine” if there is\n6 sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Id.  The\n7 court may not weigh the evidence and must view the evidence in the light most favorable to\n8 the nonmoving party.  Id. at 255.\n9 A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of\n10 the basis for its motion, and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery\nt\nr 11 responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v.\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Where the moving party will have the burden of proof at\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than\nDis strict  14 for the moving party.  Id. at 322-23.  However, on an issue for which its opponent will have\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 the burden of proof at trial, the moving party can prevail merely by “pointing out to the\nS N\ned  or the  16 district court . . . that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.” \nt F\ni 17 Id. at 325.  If the moving party meets its initial burden, the opposing party must then “set out\nn\nU\n18 specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial” to defeat the motion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e);\n19 Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.\n20\n21 DISCUSSION\n22 Chan does not dispute that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on her state\n23 law claims because she failed to present a timely claim to the County, as required by the\n24 California Tort Claims Act.  See Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 905, 911.2.  Accordingly, Defendants’\n25 motion is GRANTED as to those claims.\n26 On Chan’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Defendants contend that no constitutional\n27 violation occurred because reasonable suspicion existed to strip search Chan.  Under Ninth\n28 Circuit precedent, “arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail\n  4\n\n1 officials have a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing\n2 contraband or suffering from a communicable disease.”  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,\n3 615 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina, 199 F.3d\n4 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc).  “Reasonable suspicion may be based on such\n5 factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior\n6 arrest record.”  Id. at 617.\n7   The parties in this case dispute what information the officers performing the strip\n8 search had at the time of the search, but the Court need not resolve those disputes here.2 \n9 Even assuming that the officers had knowledge of the grounds for the restraining order and\n10 the information contained on her health questionnaire, it would be improper to resolve\nt\nr 11 Chan’s claims on summary judgment for the reasons discussed below.\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 First, it is not disputed that Chan’s arrests involved neither weapons nor contraband;\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 Defendants contend only that violation of a restraining order is, like grand theft auto,\nDis strict  14 “sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip search.”  Thompson v. City of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1441 (9th Cir. 1989); but see id. at 1441 n.6 (“We emphasize,\nS N\ned  or the  16 however, that our decision is extremely narrow and only applies to theft of an automobile;\nt F\ni 17 we express no opinion on the validity of a blanket strip search policy as applied to arrestees\nn\nU\n18 charged with other crimes against property, whether they be classified as felonies or\n19 misdemeanors.”).  However, even Defendants’ recitation of the governing statute undermines\n20 their theory.  A restraining order requires that the petitioning party suffered “harassment,”\n21 which is defined as “unlawful violence, a credible threat of violence, or a knowing and\n22 willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms, annoys, or\n23 harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate purpose.”  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code\n24 § 527.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).  Thus, it is possible for a party to obtain a restraining order\n25 without demonstrating unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence, and the evidence\n26 presented by Defendants fails to establish as an undisputed fact that the restraining order\n27\n2The Court therefore need not and does not resolve Defendants’ objections to\n28\nPlaintiff’s expert declarations at this time.\n  5\n\n1 against Chan was issued based on violence or credible threat thereof.  Although Saghafi’s\n2 petition for a restraining order claimed that Chan threatened to commit and did commit acts\n3 of violence against him, the description of Chan’s conduct asserts that Chan made repeated\n4 harassing phone calls, damaged work materials, was “aggressive,” made false accusations of\n5 assault and rape, scratched Saghafi’s car, threw toilet paper over his car and the front of his\n6 home, and broke into his mailbox and stole some of his mail.  See Ex. B to You Decl.  This\n7 fails to establish, beyond dispute, that the restraining order was based on a credible threat of\n8 violence or the actual commission of violence against Saghafi; it would not be unreasonable\n9 to conclude that the restraining order was based instead on a pattern of harassing behavior. \n10 Moreover, even if the underlying restraining order had been granted based on unlawful\nt\nr 11 violence or a credible threat thereof, a reasonable juror might conclude that the behavior for\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 which Chan was arrested – being near Saghafi’s home – involved neither violence nor the\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 threat of violence.  Consequently, although violation of a restraining order might, in some\nDis strict  14 instances, be sufficiently associated with violence such that reasonable suspicion for a strip\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 search exists, Defendants have failed to meet their burden on this motion of convincing the\nS N\ned  or the  16 Court that Chan’s offense gave rise to reasonable suspicion as a matter of law.\nt F\ni 17 Similarly, Defendants have failed to persuade the Court that Chan’s mental history\nn\nU\n18 necessarily gave rise to reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search.  Although Chan\n19 admitted that she tried to harm herself six years prior to her arrest and was a patient in a\n20 mental hospital on two occasions, three and six years prior to her arrest, she also stated that\n21 she was taking no prescription medication at the time of her arrest, did not use street drugs,\n22 had no current problems with depression, and had no current thoughts of harming herself. \n23 Chan’s health questionnaire also indicates that she was not observed to be sweaty, shaking,\n24 agitated, disoriented, or confused.  In addition, Chan was held for several hours prior to the\n25 strip search being performed – a fact that, when viewed in the light most favorable to Chan,\n26 suggests that Defendants did not consider her a threat to herself or others.  The Court cannot,\n27 on these facts, find it undisputed that Defendants had reasonable suspicion to strip search\n28 Chan based on her mental health history.\n  6\n\n1 In short, even if the Court presumes that the officers conducting the strip search had\n2 access to the underlying petition for the restraining order and Chan’s health questionnaire, it\n3 remains disputed whether the officers had “reasonable suspicion that [Chan was] carrying or\n4 concealing contraband.”  Giles, 746 F.2d at 615.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for\n5 summary judgment on Chan’s § 1983 claim is DENIED.\n6\n7 CONCLUSION\n8 For the reasons discussed above, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN\n9 PART Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  The motion is GRANTED as to Chan’s\n10 state law claims and DENIED as to Chan’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nt\nr 11 Because Chan’s federal claim has survived summary judgment, her motion for class\nu\no\na\nC ni 12 certification remains viable.  The parties shall meet and confer and file, no later than\n  or\nct alif\ntri of C 13 September 18, 2009, a stipulation and proposed order, or a joint statement setting forth their\nDis strict  14 respective proposals, regarding a briefing and hearing schedule on the class certification\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 motion.  Although Defendants have already filed their opposition to that motion, the Court\nS N\ned  or the  16 will entertain a request to file a revised opposition in light of the Court’s ruling on summary\nt F\ni 17 judgment.  \nn\nU\n18\n19 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n20\n21 Dated:   09/11/09                                                                         \nTHELTON E.

For the reasons set out below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ original \nUnit or the 18 Complaint, filed in 2004, was brought solely on behalf of misdemeanor arrestees, and does\nF\n19 not toll the statute of limitations for persons arrested on felony charges. Accordingly,\n20 Plaintiffs’ efforts to include felony arrestees in the putative class long after the statute has run\n21 must fail.

She filed a group government tort claim on\n5 August 9, 2004, alleging that she and others arrested on “minor crimes” were strip searched\n6 pursuant to a County policy.  The claim was denied.\n7 On October 20, 2004, Barnett filed a class action complaint against Contra Costa\n8 County and Sheriff Warren Rupf (“the County”) alleging that the County had an\n9 unconstitutional policy of strip searching arrestees without reasonable suspicion that they\n10 were carrying or hiding weapons or contraband.  The Complaint was brought on behalf of\n11 all persons who ... were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual\nt\nr body cavity search at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail without defendants first\nu\no 12 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be\nC productive of contraband or weapons.\n \nt 13\nc a\ns Distri ct of Californi1145 CUo.Sm.Cpl.a §in 1t9, ¶8 32.2  .

The Complaint attached Barnett’s group tort claim. \nF\nComplaint ¶ 14, Exh.

After\n21\nJune 1, 2003, however, the County had a written policy requiring that all strip searches be\n22\nbased on reasonable suspicion, and setting out procedures for documenting that suspicion\n23\nbefore strip searches were performed.   \n24\nNewly aware that Barnett herself (arrested in 2004) was not searched pursuant to the\n25\nblanket policy, Plaintiffs sought to amend the Complaint to add a new plaintiff who had been\n26\nstrip searched under the blanket policy.

The Court granted leave to amend, and the Amended Complaint was\n4 filed on August 11, 2005.  \n5 Defendants moved to dismiss Morganelli’s claims.  They argued that his state law\n6 claims were barred by his failure to comply with California’s Tort Claims Act.  Plaintiffs,\n7 without admitting that Morganelli had no claims under Cal. Penal Code § 4030 because he\n8 was arrested for felony DUI, did not oppose this portion of the motion.  \n9 In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants also argued Morganelli’s § 1983 claim was\n10 time-barred.  Plaintiffs countered that Morganelli was “undisputably a member of the class\n11 on whose behalf the action was originally filed,” because he was a “person arrested in Contra\nt\nr\nu\no 12 Costa County for minor crimes not involving drugs, weapons, or violence” and strip searched\nC\n \nt 13 under a blanket strip search policy.

With Peter Morganelli as the\nF\n19 sole class representative, they sought certification of a class consisting of\n20 “All persons, since October 20, 2002, and continuing until Defendants’ prior custom\nand policy was brought into compliance with the law on June 1, 2003, or such other\n21 more recent date when the policy was implemented, who were arrested on any charge\n(including felonies) not involving weapons, controlled substances, or felony violence,\n22 and who were subjected to a uniform and indiscriminate (blanket) strip/visual body\ncavity search(es) by defendants before arraignment at the Contra Costa County Jails\n23 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing\ncontraband.  This class may include arrestees who were subjected to subsequent\n24 blanket strip searches before arraignment after the initial strip search, without any\nreasonable individualized suspicion that they had subsequently acquired and hidden\n25 contraband on their persons.”   \n26 (Emphasis in original). \n27 With their opposition to the class certification motion, the Defendants moved to strike\n28 the felony arrest plaintiffs from the class definition in Plaintiffs’ motion for class\n  3\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 4 of 10(cid:10)\n1 certification, or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment on all claims asserted on\n2 behalf of the putative felony arrest plaintiffs.\n3\nDISCUSSION\n4\nI. The Complaint Did Not Include Felony Arrestees\n5\nRead as a whole, the class action Complaint filed on October 20, 2004 was brought on\n6\nbehalf of only misdemeanor arrestees.  \n7\nThe language of the Complaint’s class definition does not distinguish between persons\n8\narrested for misdemeanors and felonies.  The Complaint was brought on behalf of \n9\nall persons who ... were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual\n10 body cavity search at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail without defendants first\nhaving, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be\n11 productive of contraband or weapons.\nt\nr\nu\no 12 Complaint, ¶ 22.   The Complaint alleges that the searches complained of were performed\nC\n \nt 13 “without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiff, and all those similarly\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 situatedIf,  hthaids  bweeerne  athrree sotneldy  .r..e.”le  vIadn. t¶  l2an0g. u age in the Complaint, an expansive reading of the\nate Distri\n St hern 16 class definition might be warranted.  It is not.  The Complaint also states that each member of\ned Nort17 the class has a claim under Cal. Penal Code § 4030, which provides (with some exceptions)\nUnit or the 18 that strip searches of persons arrested for infractions and misdemeanors must be supported\nF\n19 by reasonable suspicion.  (Third Cause of Action, Complaint ¶ 36, alleging violation of \n20 § 4030 “on behalf of Plaintiffs and all persons similarly situated” and seeking damages under\n21 § 4030(p) on their behalf).  The Complaint alleges that legal questions under § 4030 are\n22 “common to the class,” Complaint ¶ 25 (emphasis added).  It seeks damages for the entire\n23 class under the California statute.  Id., Prayer for Relief ¶ 6.   Moreover, the Complaint\n24 alleges that the searches were performed “without regard to whether or not plaintiff, or those\n25 she represents, was eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6,” a statute\n26 involving citations for misdemeanors.  \n27 The language of the complaint must be construed as a whole.   Kasishke v. Keppler,\n28 158 F.2d 809, 811 (10th Cir. 1947).  The Complaint asserts a claim applicable only to\n  4\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 5 of 10(cid:10)\n1 misdemeanor arrestees on behalf of every class member.  Misdemeanor arrestees are not a\n2 subset of the class; they are the class.  \n3 Moreover, in various briefs before this Court, Plaintiffs have characterized their\n4 claims as involving individuals arrested on “minor charges” or for “minor offenses.”  See,\n5 e.g., Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend Complaint, filed July 19, 2005, at 2 (plaintiff brought class\n6 action “on behalf of herself and all other persons arrested in Contra Costa County for minor\n7 crimes not involving drugs, violence, or weapons...”); Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion to\n8 Dismiss, filed September 26, 2005, at 1 (“minor offense not involving drugs, weapons, or\n9 violence”).   Statements in briefs can be treated as judicial admissions that bind a party. \n10 Gospel Missions of America v. City of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 2003).1 \n11 Moreover, defendants rely particularly on representations that a plaintiff is not suing on a\nt\nr\nu\no 12 particular claim.  See, e.g., Sarro v. City of Sacramento, 78 F.Supp.2d 1057, 1061 (E.D.Cal.\nC\n \nt 13 1999) and cases cited therein.  Plaintiffs are bound to their characterization of the case as one\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 iwnevaoplvoinnsg,  opre rvsioonlesn acrer.e  sted for  “minor crimes” or “minor offenses” not involving drugs,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 In the context of this case, “minor crimes” or “minor offenses” do not include\ned Nort17 felonies.  Defendants argue that “minor offense” is a term of art that excludes felonies.  See,\nUnit or the 18 e.g., Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 716 n.8 (9th Cir. 1990)\nF\n19 (distinguishing “felonies” and “minor offenses” in the strip search context), Thompson v.\n20 County of Cook, 428 F.Supp.2d 807, 812 (N.D.Ill., 2006)(equating “minor offenses” with\n21 “misdemeanor or traffic offenses”).   Plaintiffs counter that in strip search jurisprudence, the\n22 Court’s constitutional inquiry turns on the nature of the crime charged, rather than the\n23 felony/misdemeanor distinction, see Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714-16; see also Murcia v. County\n24 of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d 489, 495 (S.D.N.Y.,2002), citing Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714, so\n25 plaintiffs’ phrase “minor offense not involving drugs, weapons, or violence” should be\n26\n27\n1   Plaintiffs’ objection to the Court’s consideration of statements in Plaintiffs’ own briefs is\n28 OVERRULED.\n  5\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 6 of 10(cid:10)\n1 viewed as shorthand that could include a class of cases potentially including both felonies\n2 and misdemeanors.   \n3 Defendants have the better argument.  While there are some cases which use the word\n4 “minor” to refer to felonies, see, e.g., Rodriguez-Herrera v. I.N.S., 52 F.3d 238, 239 (9th Cir.\n5 1995)(class C felony referred to as “minor offense”), far more distinguish between “minor\n6 offenses” and “felonies.”  Moreover, the Court is swayed  by the fact that Kennedy itself uses\n7 the terms as if they were mutually exclusive.  See, Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714-716.  Plaintiffs\n8 cannot ask the Court to look to the reasoning of Kennedy, but to overlook its explicit use of\n9 the very terms at issue.  In the context of this litigation, “minor offense” means a\n10 misdemeanor or lesser offense. \n11 Finally, Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(f) instructs the Court to construe the Complaint so “as to\nt\nr\nu\no 12 do substantial justice.”  Although this Rule ordinarily requires the Court to construe\nC\n \nt 13 pleadings liberally, that is not the case if a liberal construction would prejudice the defendant\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 bLeucnaduys ev .t hAed apmleaard ionfg N feawile Jde tros egyi,v Ien tch.,e 3 d4e Ffe.n3dda 1n1t 7n3o,t i1c1e8 o6f  (w3rhda tC wira. s1 9be9i4n)g,  qaulloetgiendg.  5 S Cehe,a rel.egs.,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1286, at 558-59 (2d ed.\ned Nort17 1990) (“[A]n inadvertent mistake in a pleading will not be held against the pleader if another\nUnit or the 18 party has not been misled by the mistake or otherwise prejudiced.”).  The phrase “substantial\nF\n19 justice” must be given “a practical meaning. ...[T]his does not mean, on the one hand, that the\n20 plaintiff may by pleading, mislead, entrap, surprise or prejudice his adversary, nor on the\n21 other that a party should be permitted to weave a net of artificial refinements and subtle\n22 technicalities in which to catch an unwary litigant.”  Cherry v. Dealers Transport Co.,  64\n23 F.Supp. 682, 683 (D. Mo. 1946).\n24    Here, there are several factors which, although not themselves determinative,\n25 convince the Court that its narrower reading is not only correct but necessary to do\n26 substantial justice.  First, counsel for Plaintiffs have brought other strip-search cases which\n27 distinguished between felony and misdemeanor arrestees.  For example, in Bull v. City and\n28 County of San Francisco, United States District Court for the Northern District of California\n  6\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 7 of 10(cid:10)\n1 Case No. C-03-1840, plaintiffs (represented by Plaintiffs’ counsel in this case) sought\n2 certification of a subclass of felony and misdemeanor arrestees for federal strip search\n3 claims, and a subclass of misdemeanor arrestees for claims under Penal Code § 4030;  Judge\n4 Breyer granted the motion months before the Complaint in this action was filed. \n5 See Memorandum and Order, filed June 10, 2004, at 8, 12.   Plaintiffs were capable of clearly\n6 alleging a class that included felony arrestees who did not have claims under Penal Code \n7 § 4030 but did not do so. \n8 Second, when Plaintiffs sought information on persons arrested on “charges not\n9 involving drugs, weapons, or violence,” Defendants objected that the phrase “not involving\n10 drugs, weapons, or violence” was vague and ambiguous.   The phrase had been used in\n11 several contexts:  in Interrogatory No. 2, in “charges not involving drugs, weapons, or\nt\nr\nu\no 12 violence,”  in Interrogatory No. 3, “misdemeanors, infractions, or minor offenses not\nC\n \nt 13 involving drugs, weapons, or violence,” and in Interrogatory No. 4, “crimes not involving\nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 darrguuges,d w theea pmoenasn, ionrg v wioalse nccleea.”r ,  Isnp ethciefiirc amlloyt iroenfe tror icnogm top ePle dniaslc oCvoedrey   r§e s4p0o3n0s:es, Plaintiffs\nate Distri\n St hern 16 Psternipa ls eCaorcdhee §s ,4 s0p3e0c,i ftihcea lClya lriefoferrnsi ato l apwer rseognusl aatrirnegst hedo won a nchda wrgheesn “ cinovuonltvieisn gc awne caopnodnusc,t\ned Nort17 controlled substances, or violence.”  Cal.

In other words,\n20\nPlaintiffs referred the Defendants to a California statute on misdemeanor arrestees to clarify\n21\nwhat “charges not involving drugs, weapons or violence” meant.  Defendants ultimately\n22\nresponded to the interrogatories by compiling lists of arrestees which eliminated felony\n23\narrests entirely.  See Declaration of Lt. Jacqueline Rubin in Support of Opposition to Motion\n24\nfor Class Certification, ¶¶ 3-7 (Rubin prepared response to Interrrogatory No. 3 by\n25\neliminating felonies); Declaration of Lt. Jacqueline Rubin in Support of Reply to Plaintiffs’\n26\nOpposition to Motion to Strike or for Partial Summary Judgment ¶¶ 2-3 (Rubin prepared\n27\n28\n  7\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 8 of 10(cid:10)\n1 response to Interrogatory No. 2 by eliminating felonies).2   Defendants were not on notice\n2 that felonies were included in the claims.\n3 It is clear to the Court from the timing of events in this litigation that Plaintiffs are\n4 trying to sweep felony arrestees into the class at this late date to make the class fit the\n5 proposed class representative, rather than vice versa.  The case was originally filed on behalf\n6 of only misdemeanor arrestees. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Strike Putative Felony\n7 Arrest Plaintiffs From The Class Definition is GRANTED.\n8 II. Plaintiff Morganelli’s Claims Are Time-Barred\n9 Plaintiff Morganelli’s claims, added to this case with the Amended Complaint filed\n10 August 11, 2005, are time-barred.3  \n11 The County issued a written strip-search policy on June 1, 2003.  Defendants argue\nt\nr\nu\no 12 that the challenged “blanket” strip-search policy ended on that day, and the statute of\nC\n \nt 13 limitations for any challenge to the blanket strip search policy began to run at that time.  \nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 2003, bPulta cinotniftefsn dac tkhnaot wthlee dstgaet uthtea ts hthoeu lnde wru nw frriottmen t shter idpa steea trhceh p poolliiccyy w waass  aicstsuuaeldly on June 1,\nate Distri\n St hern 16 implemented, and the Court should deny partial summary judgment because Defendants\ned Nort17 failed “to present any proof of the actual termination date of the blanket policy.”  \nUnit or the 18 At the same time, however, Plaintiffs affirmatively argue that the blanket policy ended\nF\n19 on June 1, 2003 in support of their own motion for class certification.   In the context of\n20\n2   Plaintiffs objected to and moved to strike Lt. Rubin’s reply declaration on the\n21 grounds that it was irrelevant, contained inadmissible hearsay, and was improperly filed with\nthe Reply brief rather than in support of the motion itself.  The motion to strike is DENIED.  \n22 The Court is considering Ms. Rubin’s testimony about her own understanding and statements\nnot for the truth the matter, but to show Defendants’ understanding of the claims involved,\n23 and they are relevant to the issue of what reading of the Complaint would serve substantial\njustice.  While the declaration was filed with Defendants’ Reply, the Court finds that the\n24 testimony relating to the County’s understanding of the scope of the class is offered in\nrebuttal to Plaintiff’s Opposition to the motion.  Moreover, Plaintiffs responded with their\n25 own subsequently filed declarations.  See Declaration of Mark E. Merin in Support of Reply\nto Opposition to Plaintiffs' Evidentiary Motion to Strike Affidavits as Untimely Filed, filed\n26 December 22, 2007.   The Court is not considering Ms. Rubin’s account of Mr. Merin’s\nstatements.\n27\n3  The Amended Complaint only explicitly added Morganelli’s claims, and did not\n28 purport to add the claims of some additional class or subclass of felony arrestees. \n  8\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 9 of 10(cid:10)\n1 arguing Morganelli is an adequate class representative, Plaintiffs alleged that all plaintiffs’\n2 state law claims were time-barred because the blanket strip search policy was discontinued\n3 on June 1, 2003: \n4 Defendants discontinued the blanket strip search policy on or about June 1, 2003;  a\ntort claim to preserve state law claims for strip searches under the blanket policy had\n5 to be filed by January 1, 2004, and, if this deadline was not met, an application for\nrelief from failure to file had to be made within one year, that is, by June 1, 2004.  A\n6 tort claim was filed on behalf of the class by plaintiff Rosalety Barnett on August 9,\n2004,  but it was too late to protect the class’ state law claims for strip searches under\n7 the discontinued blanket policy.  \n8 Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification,\n9 Docket No. 71, at 10:8-16 (citations omitted, emphasis in original).\n10 Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways.   If the statute of limitations started to run for the\n11 state law claims on June 1, 2003, when the policy was discontinued, it started to run on the\nt\nr\nu\no 12 same date for the Fourth Amendment claims.\nC\n \nt 13 The statute of limitations for Morganelli’s claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is two years.  \nc a\ni ni\ns Distr ct of Califor1145 MThael dsotantaudteo  tvh.e Hreaforrries ,r a3n7 0o nF .M3da y9 4351,,  925040 5(.9  th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 1725 (2005). \nate Distri\n St hern 16   Morganelli’s claims were added several months later, on August 11, 2005.  If\ned Nort17 Morganelli were a member of the class as alleged in the Complaint, the statute of limitations\nUnit or the 18 on his claims would be tolled from the time the Complaint was filed to the time class\nF\n19 certification is denied.  American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554\n20 (1974); Catholic Social Services v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 1139, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2000).   But\n21 because Morganelli is not a member of the class, the tolling doctrine does not apply.   Nor do\n22 his claims relate back under In re Syntex Corp. Securities Litigation, 95 F.3d 922, 935 (9th\n23 Cir. 1996), because the original Complaint did not give Defendants notice of the claims of\n24 felony arrestees.   His claims are therefore time-barred.  \n25 Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to the sole\n26 felony arrest plaintiff in the case, Peter Morganelli.\n27 //\n28\n  9\n\nCase 3:04-cv-04437-TEH     Document 96     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 10 of 10(cid:10)\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the reasons set out above, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Strike\n3 Putative Felony Arrest Plaintiffs From The Class Definition, and GRANTS Defendants’\n4 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to plaintiff Morganelli.  Because no proposed class\n5 representative remains, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification without\n6 prejudice. \n7 A further case management conference in both Case No. C-04-4437 and Case No. C-\n8 04-5365 is set for March 19, 2007, at 1:30 p.m. \n9  \n10 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n11\nt\nr\nu\no 12\nC\n \nt 13 Dated: January 24, 2007                                                                           \nc a\ns Distri ct of Californi1145 TUHNEITLETDO NST EA.

Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC '' 1331 and \n13 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.   \n14 The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs. \n15\nPARTIES \n16 1.  Plaintiff VANESSA HUNT and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material times \n17 herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of California who were arrested \n18 within the period beginning two (2) years before the filing of the Complaint in this action, and continuing \n19 to this date, and who were subjected to second, successive strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a \n20 CONTRA COSTA County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the ACONTRA COSTA County Jail@), prior to \n21 being housed without the defendants having a rational penological purpose for such second successive \n22 strip searches. \n23 2.  Defendants coerced, forced, and compelled plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT to give a \n24 urine sample without legal justification for requiring same.  Moreover, defendants coerced, forced, and \n25 compelled plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT to give a urine sample in an area of the CONTRA COSTA \n26 County Jail that was not sufficiently private so as to prevent persons not participating in the collection of \n27 the sample from observing the collection.  Furthermore, defendants required plaintiff to provide the urine \n28 sample while being directly observed by defendants= male and female officers. \n  BARNETT, ET AL. V.

At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the color \n15 of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of the state of \n16 California, the COUNTY OF CONTRA COSTA and/or the CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF=S \n17 DEPARTMENT.  \n18 6.

Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated to Plaintiff Vanessa Hunt who, during \n7 the period beginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were \n8 subjected by defendants to a second, successive pre- housing strip and/or visual body cavity searches \n9 after being booked without defendants having a rational penological purpose for such strip search.   \n10\nFACTS \n11 10.  On or about March 1, 2004, plaintiff ROSALETY BARNETT (hereinafter referred to as \n12 Aplaintiff@) was falsely arrested for allegedly resisting arrest.  Plaintiff was taken to the CONTRA \n13 COSTA County Jail in Martinez, California, where she was coerced, forced, and compelled to produce a \n14 urine sample while being directly observed by male deputies (DOES 1 and 5). \n15 11.  On or about May 16, 2003, Plaintiff Vanessa Hunt was taken into custody following a  \n16 arrest in CONTRA COSTA COUNTY for an unknown violation of law (reportedly misdemeanor \n17 vandalism) after she was removed from her mother’s house by the Kensington Police. She was strip \n18 searched at the Martinez Detention Facility after she could not post bail and was scheduled to be housed.  \n19 She was then transferred to the West County Detention Facility and strip searched again before being \n20 placed in housing. She was handcuffed at the Martinez Detention Facility after being strip searched, \n21 handcuffed and chained during transport, and remained in handcuffs upon arrival at West County \n22 Detention Facility until she was subjected to the second strip search. She was segregated in a small group \n23 of female inmates who were also transported from the Martinez Detention Facility to the West County \n24 Detention Facility, and never intermingled with other inmates who had not also been strip searched and \n25 handcuffed. She was released after about a week and was never arraigned on any charges or required to \n26 appear in court. \n27 12.  In each of the two instances when plaintiff Hunt was strip searched by defendants at \n28 Contra Costa County jails, she was stripped naked and required to lift her arms then her feet so the \n  BARNETT, ET AL.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants routinely \n4 followed their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting female detainees, including plaintiff Hunt, and \n5 all those she represents, to second, successive strip and visual body cavity searches without having, a \n6 rational penological purpose for such second strip search. \n7 14.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have the ability \n8 to identify all such similarly situated female plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants= \n9 custody, at the CONTRA COSTA County Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in \n10 this action, were subjected to such second strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to \n11 housing without defendants having a rational penological purpose for such second, successive strip \n12 search. \n13 15.  Defendant CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF WARREN E. RUPF is personally \n14 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom \n15 pursuant to which plaintiffs, and those they represent, were subjected.  \n16 16.  As a result of being subjected to the second strip search complained of herein, plaintiff \n17 Hunt, and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, \n18 invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional \n19 rights, and are entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum, $4,000 each as \n20 specified in California Civil Code ' 52 and ' 52.1(b). \n21 17.  As a result of being unjustifiably coerced, forced, and compelled to provide a urine \n22 sample and to do so while being directly observed by male deputies of the CONTRA COSTA County \n23 Jail as complained of herein, plaintiff BARNETT suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and \n24 violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to \n25 recover damages according to proof, but a minimum of $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code ' 52 \n26 and ' 52.1(b). \n27 \\\\\\ \n28 \\\\\\ \n  BARNETT, ET AL.

The second, successive strip and visual body cavity search to which plaintiff Hunt, and all \n2\nthose similarly situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of \n3\ndefendants CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SHERIFF WARREN E.

The searches complained of herein \n7\nwere performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiffs, and all those \n8\nsimilarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, or those they represent, \n9\nwere eligible for cite and release under Penal Code ' 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, \n10\nand each of those similarly situated, were eligible for and/or were released on his or her own \n11\nrecognizance.  Furthermore, the second strip searches complained of herein were performed without \n12\ndefendants having a rational penological purpose. \n13\n19.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \n14\nsituated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n15\n20.  The class is defined to include all female arrestees who were members of the class \n16\npreviously certified in this action, and who, in the period from and including two (2) years prior to the \n17\nfiling of the original Complaint on October 20, 2002, and continuing until June 1, 2003, were arrested \n18\nand subjected to a second, successive strip and/or visual body cavity search prior to being housed at the \n19\nCONTRA COSTA County Jail without defendants having a valid penological purpose for such second \n20\nstrip search. \n21\n21.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the class \n22\nare so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact number of \n23\nclass members, but are informed and believe there are at least forty seven females who were subjected to \n24\na second strip search as a matter of routine policy.   \n25\n22.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are informed \n26\nand believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class including, \n27\nbut not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all females arrested to visual body cavity \n28\n  BARNETT, ET AL.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are informed \n7 and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class including, \n8 but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform second, successive visual body cavity \n9 searches on persons prior to housing under the conditions of this case, where female inmates are kept \n10 handcuffed after the first strip search and not mingled with the general population; (2) whether \n11 defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use \n12 of the visual body cavity search to defendants= penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and \n13 determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity \n14 searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the \n15 search without violating plaintiffs= State and Federal constitutional rights (4) whether or not defendants= \n16 strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the Federal Constitution.  \n17 24.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \n18 representative plaintiff Hunt are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to housing, for a \n19 second time without a rational penological purpose. Representative plaintiff Hunt has the same interests \n20 and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiff’s= claims arose because of \n21 defendants= policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to successive pre-housing strip and/or \n22 visual body cavity searches without having a rational penological purpose for such searches.  Each class \n23 member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a second pre-housing strip and/or visual \n24 body cavity search.  The actual damages suffered by the representative plaintiffs are similar in type and \n25 amount to the actual damages suffered by each class member.   \n26 25.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative \n27 plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiff’s= interests are consistent with and \n28 not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n  BARNETT, ET AL. V. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY, ET AL.; CASE NO.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of \n2 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying \n3 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards of \n4 conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.   \n5 27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of \n6 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications with \n7 respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair or \n8 impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests. \n9 28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are \n10 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable \n11 to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class \n12 as a whole.   \n13 29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is \n14 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between the \n15 parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of the \n16 class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n17 would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs also are informed and believe, and \n18 thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits would be \n19 impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class \n20 will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon \n21 allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the \n22 same location; i.e., the CONTRA COSTA County Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the \n23 common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.   \n24 30.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members, although, through \n25 discovery, Plaintiffs have determined that at least 47 females were subject to the second pre-housing strip \n26 search during the applicable period.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the \n27 identities of the class members may be ascertained from records maintained by the COUNTY OF \n28 CONTRA COSTA and defendant SHERIFF WARREN E.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \n2 defendants= records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who \n3 have been held in custody in the CONTRA COSTA County Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, \n4 and thereupon allege, that records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a second \n5 pre-housing strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, \n6 and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon \n7 allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in defendants= computer system and that the \n8 information necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons \n9 for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available from said computer system.   \n10 31.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members must \n11 be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all \n12 members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n13 thereupon allege, that defendants= computer records contain a last known address for class members.  \n14 Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last known address \n15 by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of the following: \n16\ni.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \n17\nii.
