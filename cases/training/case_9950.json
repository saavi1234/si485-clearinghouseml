    "summary": "<p>Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 in California state court challenging the Sacramento County Jail's policy of strip-searching all detainees, regardless of charges.  Plaintiff was arrested on misdemeanor charges for protesting at a hearing where the Forestry Department was discussing cutting down trees on private property.  She was taken to jail and subjected to a strip search, including a videotaped body cavity search.  She subsequently filed a state court class action suit against the sheriff and county, alleging privacy and other civil rights violations.  </p><p>On March 14, 2000, the Sacramento County Superior Court (Judge Thomas Cecil), certified the class.  The court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the privacy rights issue in January 2003, awarding each class member was awarded the greater amount between actual damages or $1,000.  (The court ruled for defendant on the §1983 claim, finding that the sheriff had immunity from suit.)  </p><p>Defendants appealed, seeking to have the class action decertified and reversal on the summary judgment decision.  While that appeal was pending, Sacramento County changed its search policy.  </p><p>The private attorney for the plaintiff then brought a similar §1983 class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, but the court refused to allow any plaintiffs who were included in the state court class.  </p><p>The parties then reached a settlement, which they submitted to the superior court in June 2004.  The court (Judge Richard Park) approved it preliminarily that same month, setting a fairness hearing for October 2004.  Judge Park gave final approval to the settlement on October 22, 2004.  According to news reports, eventually over 4300 claims were submitted.  Attorney Mark Merin received a $3 million dollar fee; $500,000 was allocated to claim administration.  The 7 named plaintiffs split $410,000.  Most other plaintiffs received between $1000 and $3500; about 1000 claimed more because of psychological injury they suffered.  In the end, defendants' total payout was about $15 million.</p><p></p>",

MEMORANDUM  AND  ORDER \n16  COUNTY  OF  SACRAMENTO  COUNTY, \net  al., \n17 \nDefendants. \n18 \n----00000----\n19 \n20  This  matter  comes  before  the  court  on  defendants'  motion  to \n21  dismiss  on  the  basis  that  plaintiffs'  claims  are  barred  by  the \n22  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  and,  in  the  alternative,  by  the  Younger \n23  and  Colorado  River  abstention  doctrines.  The  court  heard  oral \n24  argument  on  July  11,  2003,  and  by  this  order  now  renders  its \n25  decision. \n26  /  /  / \n27  /  /  / \n28  /  /  / \n\n1  BACKGROUND 1 \n2  On  March  7,  2003,  plaintiffs  Mary  Bull,  Scott  Brusaschetti, \n3  Jason  Wilson,  Rose  Panofsky,  Nicholas  Page,  Ellen  Faukner, \n4  Donizetti  Hale  and  all  others  similarly  situated  (\"plaintiffs\") \n5  filed  the  instant  class  action  complaint  against  defendants \n6  County  of  Sacramento  and  Sacramento  County  Sheriff  Lou  Blanas \n7  (collectively,  \"defendants\")  alleging  violations  of  42  U.S.C.  § \n8  1983  (\"section  1983\")  and  the  Unruh  Civil  Rights  Act  (Cal.  Civ. \n9  Code  §  52.1(b)). \n10  Specifically,  plaintiffs  allege  that  they  were  unlawfully \n11  subjected  to  visual  body  cavity  searches  pursuant  to  defendant \n12  Sacramento  County  Sheriff's  policy  of  subjecting  all  persons \n13  arrested  and  intended  to  be  housed  in  the  Sacramento  County  Main \n14  Jail  to  visual  body  cavity  searches  prior  to  arraignment. \n15  Plaintiffs  claim  that  the  policy  of  conducting  such  searches  in \n16  groups  where  the  persons  searched  may  be  observed  by  others  being \n17  searched,  and  without  individualized  reasonable  suspicion  that \n18  the  searches  would  be  productive  of  contraband,  is  a  violation  of \n19  their  rights  under  section  1983  and  the  Unruh  Civil  Rights  Act. \n20  Plaintiffs  allege  that  these  searches  are  unlawful  and  entitle \n21  plaintiffs  to  damages  under  section  1983  and  the  Unruh  Civil \n22  Rights  Act. \n23  Prior  to  the  instant  action,  six  of  the  named  plaintiffs \n24  filed  a  complaint  in  Sacramento  County  Superior  Court  on  behalf \n25  of  themselves  and  a  class  of  similarly  situated  individuals \n26 \n27  1  The  factual  background  as  recited  herein  is  taken \nprimarily  from  plaintiffs'  complaint  (\"PIs.'  Compl.\"),  filed \n28 \nMarch  7,  2003. \n2 \n\n1  charged  with  misdemeanors  and  minor  infractions.  Plaintiffs \n2  alleged  violations  of  the  California  Constitution,  California \n3  Penal  Code  section  4030,  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  This  action  was \n4  certified as  a  class  action  by  the  Sacramento  County  Superior \n5  Court  on  December  6,  2001  and  was  joined with  an  action  filed  by \n6  named  plaintiff  Donizetti  Hale  for  all  purposes. \n7  On  February  5,  2003,  the  Sacramento  County  Superior  Court \n8  issued  an  order  granting  summary  adjudication  as  to  plaintiffs' \n9  causes  of  action  arising  under  the  California  Constitutional \n10  Right  to  Privacy  and  Penal  Code  section  4030. 2  The  court  also \n11  granted  summary  adjudication  dismissing  plaintiffs'  cause  of \n12  action  under  section  1983  against  the  County  of  Sacramento  and \n13  Sheriff  Blanas  in  his  official  and/or  individual  capacities.  In \n14  finding  that  a  California  sheriff  is  a  state  official  and \n15  therefore  immune  from  liability under  section  1983,  the  court \n16  followed  a  California  court  of  appeals  decision  in  County  of  Los \n17  Angeles  v.  Superior  Court  (Peters),  68  Cal.  App.  4th  1166  (1998). \n18  In  contrast,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  held  in  Brewster  v.  Shasta \n19  County,  275  F.3d  803,  807  (9th  Cir.  2001),  and  Cortez  v.  County \n20  of  Los  Angeles,  294  F.3d  1186,  1190  (9th  Cir.  2002),  that \n21  sheriffs  are  county  officials  and  therefore  liable  under  section \n22  1983.  Nevertheless,  the  superior  court  reasoned  that  the \n23  determination  of  a  sheriff's  status  as  a  state  or  county  actor  is \n24  dependent  upon  an  interpretation  of  California  law,  and, \n25  therefore,  the  superior  court  is  bound  by  the  interpretation  of \n26 \n2  See  Superior  Court  Order,  Case  No.  01AS01545,  filed \n27 \nFeb.  5,  2003  (\"Superior  Court  Order\"),  attached  as  Ex.  C  to  P.  & \nA.  in  Opp'n  to  Defs.'  Mot.  to  Dismiss  Pis.'  Compl.  (\"Pis.' \n28 \nOpp'n\"),  filed  May  20,  2003. \n3 \n\n1  the  California  Court  of  Appeal. \n2  Defendants  now  move  to  dismiss  plaintiffs'  complaint  on  the \n3  basis  that  this  court  lacks  subject  matter  jurisdiction over \n4  plaintiffs'  section  1983  claim pursuant  to  the  Rooker-Feldman \n5  doctrine  and,  in  the  alternative,  plaintiffs'  claims  are  barred \n6  by  the  Younger  and  Colorado  River  abstention  doctrines. 3 \n7  STANDARD \n8  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12 (b) (1)  permits  a  defendant \n4 \n9  to  move  for  dismissal  for  lack  of  jurisdiction  over  the  subject \n10  matter  at  any  time.  American  Fire  & Casualty  Co.  v.  Finn,  341 \nu.s. \n11  6,  16-18  (1951).  The  court  is  under  a  continuing  duty  to \n12  dismiss  an  action  whenever  it appears  that  the  court  lacks \n13  jurisdiction.  Billingsley v.  C.l.R.,  868  F.2d  1081,  1085  (9th \n14  Cir.  1989). \n15  Where  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  applies,  a  district  court \n16  is  found  to  be  without  subject  matter  jurisdiction.  District  of \nu.s. \n17  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  v.  Feldman,  460  462  (1983); \n18  Worldwide  Church  of  God  v.  McNair,  805  F.2d  888,  889  (9th  Cir. \n19  1986)  (holding  that  because  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  applies \n20  to  plaintiffs'  claim,  \"we  conclude  that  the  district  court  lacked \n21  subject  matter  jurisdiction over  the  action,  and  that  it should \n22  have  dismissed  on  that  basis\") . \n23 \n24  Defendants  do  not  identify  the  specific  Federal  Rule  of \n3 \nCivil  Procedure  pursuant  to  which  they  move  to  dismiss \n25  plaintiffs'  complaint.  However,  because  the  basis  for  dismissal \nis  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  the  court  construes \n26  defendants'  motion  as  one  made  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure  12 (b)  (1) . \n27 \n4  Any  further  references  to  a  \"Rule\"  are  to  the  Federal \n28 \nRules  of  Civil  Procedure  unless  otherwise  indicated. \n4 \n\n1  ANALYSIS \n2  A.  Plaintiffs'  42  u.s.c.  §  1983  Claim \n3  Defendants  move  to  dismiss  plaintiffs'  section  1983  claim  on \n4  the  basis  that  it is  barred  by  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine. \n5  Plaintiffs  argue  that  Rooker-Feldman  does  not  apply  here  because \n6  the  federal  action  is  not  \"inextricably  intertwined\"  with  the \n7  decision  made  in  state  court.  Plaintiffs  raise  two  bases  for  this \n8  assertion:  (1)  the  federal  court  can  find  in  favor  of  plaintiffs \n9  without  reviewing  the  decision  of  the  state  court;  and  (2)  the \n10  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  applies  only  when  a  state  court  judgment \n11  is  res  judicata  on  a  federal  claim  and,  in  this  instance,  the \n12  state  court  judgment  falls  into  the  public  interest  exception  to \n13  res  judicata. \n14  1.  Review  of  the  Superior  Court  Decision \n15  The  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  provides  that  a  federal  court, \n16  other  than  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  lacks  subject  matter \n17  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  a  claim  that  is  \"inextricably \n18  intertwined\"  with  a  determination  previously made  by  a  state \n19  court.  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  v.  Feldman,  460  U.S. \n20  462,  476  (1983).  This  doctrine  is  premised,  in  part,  on  the \n21  inability of  a  district  court  as  a  court  of  original  jurisdiction \n22  to  review  the  final  determinations  of  a  state  court.  Rooker  v. \n23  Fidelity Trust  Co.,  263  U.S.  413,  415-16  (1923)  (finding  that \n24  district  courts  may  not  exercise  appellate  jurisdiction over \n25  state  courts);  Doe  & Associates  Law  Offices  v.  Napolitano,  252 \n26  F.3d  1026,  1029  (9th  Cir.  2001)  (\"If  the  federal  constitutional \n27  claims  presented  to  the  district  court  are  'inextricably \n28  intertwined'  with  the  state  court's  judgment,  then  [plaintiff]  is \n5 \n\n1  essentially  asking  the  district  court  to  review  the  state  court's \n2  decision,  which  the  district  court  may  not  do\") . \n3  This  doctrine  applies  even  when  the  challenge  to  the  state \n4  court  decision  involves  federal  constitutional  issues.  Feldman, \nu.s. \n5  460  at  484-86  (\"This  rule  applies  even  though,  as  here,  the \n6  challenge  is  anchored  to  alleged  deprivations  of  federally \n7  protected  due  process  and  equal  protection  rights\")  (quoting  Doe \n8  v.  Pringle,  550  F.2d  596,  599  (10th  Cir.  1976),  cert.  denied,  431 \nu.s. \n9  916  (1977);  Robinson  v.  Ariyoshi,  753  F.2d  1468,  1471-72 \n10  (9th  Cir.  1985)  (federal  court  has  no  jurisdiction  over  federal \n11  constitutional  issues  if consideration  would  require  a  review  of \n12  the  allegations  underlying  the  state  judicial  decision),  vacated \nu.s. \n13  on  other  grounds,  447  902  (1986).  However,  Rooker-Feldman \n14  does  not  operate  to  bar  a  federal  court  from  hearing  a  \"general \n15  constitutional  challenge,\"  defined  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  as  \"one \n16  that  does  not  require  review  of  a  final  state  court  decision  in  a \n17  particular  case.\"  Doe  & Associates,  252  F.3d  at  1029  (citing \n18  Dubinka  v.  Judges  of  the  Superior  Court,  23  F.3d  218,  221  (9th \n19  Cir.  1994)). \n20  While  the  distinction  is  far  from  clear  as  to  when  a  claim \n21  is  \"inextricably  intertwined\"  with  a  state  court  decision  or \n22  merely  a  permissible  general  constitutional  challenge,  in  G.C. \n23  and  K.B.  Investments,  Inc.  v.  Wilson,  326  F.3d  1096,  1103  (9th \n24  Cir.  2003),  the  Ninth  Circuit  stated  that  \"[u]nder  the  rubric  of \n25  either  jurisdiction  or  res  judicata,  the  crux  of  the  question  is \n26  whether  there  has  already  been  actual  consideration  of  and  a \n27  decision  on  the  issue  presented.\"  Thus,  for  example,  a  district \n28  court  may  not  examine  a  constitutional  challenge  to  a  state  grand \n6 \n\n1  jury  subpoena  if the  party  had  already  challenged  the  subpoena \n2  through  the  state  courts,  since  doing  so  would  require  finding \n3  that  the  state  court  was  wrong  in  issuing  the  subpoena.  Doe  & \n4  Associates,  252  F.3d  at  1029-30. \n5  In  the  case  currently  before  the  court,  it is  clear  that  the \n6  Superior  Court  of  Sacramento  County  actually  and  expressly \n7  considered  and  decided  the  issue  of  whether  defendant  Sacramento \n8  County  Sheriff  Lou  Blanas  is  immune  from  liability under  section \n9  1983.  This  court  cannot  find  for  plaintiffs  under  section  1983 \n10  without  determining  that  defendant  is  not  immune,  a  decision  that \n11  would  be  in  direct  conflict  with  the  superior  court's  order. \n12  Therefore,  because  the  named  plaintiffs  here  were  also  parties  to \n13  the  state  action,  to  consider  plaintiffs'  section  1983  claims \n14  would  be  to  impermissibly  review  the  decision  of  the  superior \n15  court,  which  is  precisely  the  kind  of  act  barred  by  the  Rooker-\n16  Feldman  doctrine. \n17  2.  Public  Interest Exception  to  Res  Judicata \n18  Plaintiffs  also  argue  that  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  the  Rooker-\n19  Feldman  doctrine  applies  only  where  the  state  court  judgment \n20  would  have  res  judicata  effect  on  the  federal  claim.  Plaintiffs \n21  suggest  that  because  this  court  must  look  to  state  law  to \n22  determine  whether  a  state  court  judgment  is  preclusive,  the \n23  state's public  interest  exception  applies  to  foreclose  any  res \n24  judicata  effect.  Defendants  argue  this  is  an  overly  restrictive \n25  reading  of  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine.  It  is  unnecessary  to \n26  address  this  argument,  because  this  case  does  not  fall  into  the \n27  narrow  category  of  exceptions  to  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata. \n28  An  otherwise  precluded  issue  may  be  litigated when  \"strict \n7 \n\n1  application  of  collateral  estoppel  would  foreclose  any \n2  reexamination  of  the  holding  of  that  case.\"  City  of  Sacramento  v. \n3  State  of  California,  50  Cal.  3d  51,  64  (1990).  For  example,  in \n4  City  of  Sacramento  v.  State  of  California,  the  state,  which  was \n5  the  losing  party  in  earlier  litigation,  was  permitted  to \n6  relitigate  an  issue  regarding  its  unemployment  insurance  law \n7  under  the  public  interest  exception  to  preclusion  principles.  Id. \n8  In  finding  the  case  to  be  appropriate  for  relitigation,  the  court \n9  reasoned  that  if the  first  decision  was  \"wrong  but \n10  unimpeachable,\"  \"[t]he  state  would  remain  bound,  and  no  other \n11  person  would  have  occasion  to  challenge  the  precedent.  Yet  the \n12  consequences  of  any  error  transcend  those  which  would  apply  to \n13  mere  private  parties\"  because  \"taxpayers  statewide  will  suffer \n14  unjustly\"  as  a  result.  Id.;  see  also  Kopp  v.  Fair  Political \n15  Practices  Commission,  11  Cal.  4th  607  (1995)  (also  finding  that \n16  preclusion  doctrines  do  not  bar  consideration  of  a  state  law \n17  issue  because  \"the  consequences  of  any  error  transcend  those \n18  which  would  apply  to  mere  private  parties\"  and  \"if the  result  of \n19  [the  earlier  litigation]  is  wrong  but  unimpeachable,\"  there  would \n20  be  no  means  of  correcting  the  former  result  under  preclusion \n21  principles)  (citing  City  of  Sacramento  v.  State  of  California,  50 \n22  Cal.  3d  51  (1990)). \n23  Similarly,  in  Bates  v.  Jones,  127  F.3d  870,  872  (9th  Cir. \n24  1997),  the  Ninth  Circuit  found  that  res  judicata  did  not  preclude \n25  opponents  of  an  initiative  imposing  lifetime  legislative  term \n26  limits  from  intervening  even  though  some  of  the  interveners  were \n27  parties  to  prior  state  court  litigation.  The  court  held  that  any \n28  res  judicata  effect  was  outweighed  by  the  public  policy  issues  at \n8 \n\n1  stake  since  both  voters  and  candidates  would  suffer  serious \n2  injustice  if  some  incumbents  were  permitted  to  run  for  re-\n3  election  while  others  were  barred  from  office  because  they  were \n4  plaintiffs  to  the  state  court  litigation. \n5  The  circumstances  surrounding  the  case  currently before  the \n6  court  do  not  support  an  exception  to  the  doctrine  of  res \n7  judicata.  In  this  instance,  the  consequences  of  any  error  in  the \n8  original  judgment  are  limited  to  the  plaintiffs  involved  in  that \n9  action  and  subject  to  review  in  the  California  Court  of  Appeal. \n10  Moreover,  the  superior  court  found  defendants'  strip  search \n11  policy  unconstitutional  pursuant  to  the  California  Constitutional \n12  Right  to  Privacy  (Art.  I,  §  1)  and  unlawful  under  California \n13  Penal  Code  section  4030,  awarding  each  of  the  plaintiffs  \"actual \n14  damages,  or  one  thousand  dollars  ($1,000),  whichever  is  greater\" \n15  pursuant  to  California  Penal  Code  section  4030(p).  (Superior \n16  Court  Order,  attached  as  Ex.  C  to  Pls.'  Opp'n.)  Had  plaintiffs \n17  not  already  recovered  damages  in  their  state  court  action,  the \n18  facts  of  this  case  may  have  invoked  important  public  policy \n19  implications  necessitating  application  of  the  public  interest \n20  exception  to  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata.  However,  where,  as \n21  here,  defendants'  actions  have  been  adjudged  unconstitutional  and \n22  unlawful,  and  plaintiffs  have  recovered  damages  in  state  court \n23  for  the  harm  they  sustained,  relitigation  of  this  case  would,  in \n24  practical  effect,  simply  provide  plaintiffs  with  a  possible  new \n25  avenue  to  obtain  damages.  Such  relitigation  does  not  invoke \n26  public  policy  considerations  sufficient  to  warrant  application  of \n27  the  narrow  public  interest  exception. \n28  Therefore,  this  case  fails  to  meet  the  substantial  interest \n9 \n\n1  and  unusual  circumstances  necessary  to  create  a  public  interest \n2  exception  to  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata. \n3  3.  Rooker-Feldman  and Non-Parties  to  the  State  Court \n4  Action \n5  Plaintiffs  argue  that,  unlike  the  class  action  in  state \n6  superior  court,  this  case  is  brought  on  behalf  of  those  arrested \n7  for  felonies  as  well  as  those  arrested  for  misdemeanors.  Because \n8  the  previous  action  was  brought  only  on  behalf  of  those  arrested \n9  for  misdemeanors,  plaintiffs  argue  that  there  are  plaintiffs  in \n10  this  suit  that  were  not  parties  to  the  previous  state  court \n11  action.  At  oral  argument,  plaintiffs'  counsel  maintained  that \n12  their  primary  purpose  was  to  ensure  that  the  court  did  not \n13  dismiss  the  claims  of  the  plaintiffs  who  were  not  parties  to  that \n14  action. \n15  Plaintiffs  argue  correctly  that  plaintiffs  who  were  not \n16  parties  to  the  action  in  superior  court  are  not  precluded  from \n17  litigating  their  section  1983  claims  in  federal  court.  Thus, \n18  while  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  bars  the  section  1983  claims  of \n19  all  plaintiffs  named  in  the  complaint  and  many  other  members  of \n20  the  class,  there  still remain  plaintiffs  who  are  parties  to  this \n21  action  over  whom  jurisdiction would  be  proper.  Therefore, \n22  plaintiffs  shall  be  permitted  to  amend  their  complaint  to  include \n23  only  those  plaintiffs  who  were  not  parties  to  the  state  court \n24  action,  and  whose  claims  are  not  barred  by  the  Rooker-Feldman \n25  doctrine. 5 \n26 \n27  5  Because  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  is  a  sufficient \nbasis  for  dismissal  at  this  time,  the  court  does  not  reach  the \n28 \n(continued ... ) \n10 \n\n1  CONCLUSION \n2  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  defendants'  motion  to  dismiss \nu.s.c. \n3  plaintiffs'  42  §  1983  claim  is  GRANTED  with  leave  to \n4  amend.  Plaintiffs  may  amend  their  complaint  to  include  only  those \n5  plaintiffs  who  were  not  parties  to  the  state  court  action. \n6  Plaintiffs  shall  have  ninety  (90)  days  from  the  date  of  this \n7  order  to  file  their  first  amended  complaint  in  accordance  with \n8  this  order.  Defendants  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days  from  the  date \n9  of  service  of  plaintiffs'  first  amended  complaint  to  file  a \n10  response  thereto. \n11  IT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \n12  DATED:  JU1Y~ 2003. \n13 \n14  JUDGE \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n5( ••• continued) \n28 \nother  abstention  doctrines  presented. \n11 \n\nds \nUnited  States  District  Court \nfor  the \nEastern District  of  California \nJuly  23,  2003 \n*  *  CERTIFICATE  OF  SERVICE  *  * \n2:03-cv-00458 \nBull \nv. \nCounty  of  Sacramento \nI,  the  undersigned,  hereby  certify that  I  am  an  employee  in  the  Office  of \nthe  Clerk,  U.S.  District  Court,  Eastern District  of  California. \nThat  on  July  23,  2003,  I  SERVED  a  true  and  correct  copy(ies)  of \nthe  attached,  by  placing  said copy(ies)  in a  postage  paid  envelope \naddressed  to  the  person(s)  hereinafter  listed,  by  depositing  said \nenvelope  in  the  U.S.  Mail,  by  placing  said copy(ies)  into an  inter-office \ndelivery  receptacle  located  in  the  Clerk's  office,  or,  pursuant  to prior \nauthorization by  counsel,  via  facsimile. \nMark  E  Merin  MP/FCD \nLaw  Office  of  Mark  E  Merin \n2001  P  Street \nSuite  100 \nSacramento,  CA  95814 \nAvery  Emil  Dority \nPorter  Scott  Weiberg  and  Delehant \nPO  Box  255428 \n350  University Avenue \nSuite  200 \nSacramento,  CA  95865 \nTerence  John  Cassidy \nPorter Scott  Weiberg  and  Delehant \nPO  Box  255428 \n350  University Avenue \nSuite  200 \nSacramento,  CA  95865 ",

      "text": "If you were booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail  \nand strip-searched between March 14, 2000 and June 6, 2003  \nYou may be entitled to monetary compensation under a class action settlement. \n \nThere is presently pending a class action lawsuit in the Sacramento County Superior Court.  The Court has certified the case as a class action.  If the \nproposed Settlement receives final approval, people who were subjected to a strip search in the Sacramento County Main County Jail before arraignment on \ncertain charges will receive money.   \n \nIf you believe you are a member of the class and you do not get a claim form mailed to you, you may obtain a claim form by writing to the Claims \nAdministrator, Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110, or by calling the Claims \nAdministrator at 1-800-706-8584, or by contacting the class counsel, Law Office of Mark E. Merin at 2001 P Street, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95814, \n(916) 443-6911, or by e-mail at office@markmerin.com. \n \nYour Claim Form must be completed and be postmarked no later than September 30, 2004 \nFor more information, please read this notice. \n \nIf You Wish to Claim Monetary Compensation, \nObtain, Fill out and Mail the Claim Form as Soon as Possible but No Later than September 30, 2004. \n \nTO: Any person who was booked at the Sacramento County Main Jail between March 14, 2000 and June 6, 2003 on an infraction or misdemeanor \noffense or felony offense not involving violence, drugs or weapons and subjected to a strip search before arraignment. \n \nPLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. \nYOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT. \n \nThere is now pending in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento a class action lawsuit involving a class of persons defined \nas those who were booked at the Sacramento County Main Jail between March 14, 2000, and June 6, 2003, on an infraction or misdemeanor offense or \nfelony offense not involving violence, drugs or weapons and subjected to a strip search before arraignment.  \n \nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a potential class member, your rights may be affected by the \nsettlement.  This Notice also summarizes the terms and effect of the proposed settlement, what you can do to participate in it, how you can obtain money \nunder the settlement and what you must do if you choose to exclude yourself from the class.   \n \nSUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TERMS\n \nA Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) was entered into after several months of intensive negotiations between the parties, conducted with the \nassistance of a third party mediation.  The Parties are requesting that the Court Approve the Settlement.   \n \nA.  Parties to the Settlement.\n \nThe parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiffs named in Bull, et al v. County of Sacramento, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento Case \nNo. 01AS01545 on behalf of themselves and the Settlement Class, and various defendants including the County of Sacramento.  Counsel for the class is Mark E. \nMerin, The Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, Sacramento, CA  95814.  \n \nB.  Monetary Terms of Settlement\n \n1.  Class Fund and Related Expenses.   \n \nDefendants shall pay a maximum of $15,000,000 under the terms of the settlement which will hereafter be referred to as the Class Fund.   \n \nClass Counsel shall seek an award of up to $3,000,000 of the Class Fund as attorney’s fees and costs for recovering the Class Fund for the Class \nMembers.  Up to $500,000 of the Class Fund may be used for costs of claims administration.  Up to $11,500,000 may be used to pay valid claims.  \n \n2.  Payments to Class Members Who File Claims.\n \nMoney for the class will be paid out based on a distribution formula, subject to payments being proportionately reduced if the total value of verified claims \nexceeds $11,500,000. Pursuant to that distribution formula each Claimant will receive a minimum Tier-1 payment of $1,000 (One Thousand Dollars) \nupon confirmation that the Claimant is a Class Member.  In order to receive this payment, the Claimant need not do anything other than submit a valid \nClaim Form.   \n \nClaimants may also receive an additional Tier-2 payment of up to $3,500.00 (Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars).  In order to receive this payment, \nthe Claimant must answer Questions 1-10 included in the Claim form.  Also, the Claimant must submit a written description of the circumstances \nsurrounding the strip-search and/or provide documentation which supports those contentions.  Complete instructions regarding the written description \nand/or type of documentation which will be required are included in the Claim Form.   \n \nClaimants may also receive an additional Tier-3 payment of up to $25,000.00 (Twenty Five Thousand Dollars) for physical or psychological injury \nresulting from the strip-search.  In order to receive a Tier-3 payment, the Claimant must answer questions 11-13 in the Claim form, provide medical \ndocumentation supporting a Tier-3 payment and agree to submit to an examination under oath by an attorney for the County of Sacramento.  \n \nC.  Your Options as a Class Member.\n \n1.  Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\n \nTo qualify for a payment, you must send in a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. A Claim Form is included in this notice package. You can also \nget a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll free number: 1-800-706-8584; (2) requesting a Claim Form from the office of Class Counsel at: The Law Office of Mark \n\nE. Merin, 2001 P Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, telephone (916) 443-6911; or (3) writing the Claims Administrator at: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, \nc/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \n \nYou have until September 30, 2004 to submit a claim or opt -out of the settlement. \n \nMail your completed Claim Form to: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \n \nIf you need assistance in completing the claim form, feel free to contact class counsel, Mark E. Merin at the Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, \nSuite 100, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 443-6911.  A minimal fee may be charged for assistance in completing and submitting the form. \n \nRemember, if you do not send a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. Also, please note that Class Members who have already settled their claims \nwith the County of Sacramento or gone to trial with the County of Sacramento cannot receive a payment under this settlement.  If you submit a Claim \nForm, you will be bound by the Settlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you do not submit a Claim form but do not exclude yourself \nfrom the class (as explained by the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in this case, but you will not \nreceive any money. \n \nBy participating in the Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to June 6, 2003, related to strip searches by the Defendants in this case, even \nthose of which you are not aware of at present.  This waiver will include a waiver of the provisions of California Civil Code §1542, which provides that “a general \nrelease does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him \nmust have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”  By participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the litigation. \n \n2.  Exclude Yourself From the Class.\n \nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude yourself, you can not get a \npayment and you can not object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion \nletter that states that you want to be excluded from Bull, et al. v. County of Sacramento, et. al., Court File No. 01AS01545. Your exclusion letter must be \nreceived before September 30, 2004.  Mail or deliver it to: Clerk of the Court, Sacramento County Superior Court, Dept. 39, 720 Ninth Street, \nSacramento, CA 95814.   \n \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you can not get any money from the \nSettlement and you can not tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”). If you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the \nclass or the Settlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit against the County of Sacramento about the claims in this case. \n \nD.  Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections. \n \nA fairness hearing will be held on October 22, 2004 at Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA \n95814 in Department 39.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can tell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it \nat this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For example, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will \nconsider your views.  \n \nTo object, you must file a document with the court that contains all of the following: (1) The name and title of the lawsuit, Bull, et al. v. County of \nSacramento, Court File No. 01AS01545; (2) A statement of each objection you have and the facts that support the objections; (3) A description of any \nlaw or case supporting the objections; (4) A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will ask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your \nobjections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and (5) Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness \nHearing. \n \nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of attorney’s fees and \ncosts of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING ON OR BEFORE October 22, 2004, IN \nTHE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO INDICATED ABOVE, LOCATED AT 720 9TH STREET, \nSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, 95814, ATTN: CLERK, RE: BULL, ET AL V. COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO SETTLEMENT, CASE NO.  01AS01545.  If \nyou wish to appear and present your objections at the fairness hearing, you must also submit a Notice of Intention to Appear that identifies the case, \ncontains your name and address, and explains the reason the appearance is desired.  The Notice of Intention to Appear and any objections must be filed \nwith the Court on or before September 30, 2004.  You may be represented by your own attorney.  If you are to be represented by an attorney at the \nhearing, his or her name, address and telephone number must be included in the Notice of Intention to Appear as well.   \n \nA copy of the Statement of Objection and/or Notice of Intention to Appear must also be mailed to: (1) The Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, \nSacramento, CA  95814 ATTN: Mark E. Merin: and (2) Porter, Scott, Weiberg and Delehant, P.O. Box 255428, Sacramento, CA 95865, ATTN: Terrence \nCassidy. \n \nE.  How to Obtain Further Information\n \nFor additional information regarding the Settlement, or to obtain a copy of the Settlement Agreement, Notice or Court Orders, you or your counsel should \ncontact: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110.  You may also check the \nClass Administrator’s website at www.bullvsac.com or call 1-800-706-8584.  You may also obtain detailed information about the case by examining the \nCourt file located in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. \n \nF.  Court Approval.\n \nAlthough the Court has reviewed the proposed Settlement, no decision has been, or will be, reached by the Court, until the Fairness Hearing.  This \nNotice does not indicate that the Court has yet approved the Settlement. \n \n  2",

      "text": "If you were booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail  \nand strip-searched between March 14, 2000 and June 6, 2003  \nYou may be entitled to monetary compensation under a class action settlement. \n \nThere is presently pending a class action lawsuit in the Sacramento County Superior Court.  The Court has certified the case as a class action.  If the \nproposed Settlement receives final approval, people who were subjected to a strip search in the Sacramento County Main County Jail before arraignment on \ncertain charges will receive money.   \n \nIf you believe you are a member of the class and you do not get a claim form mailed to you, you may obtain a claim form by writing to the Claims \nAdministrator, Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110, or by calling the Claims \nAdministrator at 1-800-706-8584, or by contacting the class counsel, Law Office of Mark E. Merin at 2001 P Street, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95814, \n(916) 443-6911, or by e-mail at office@markmerin.com. \n \nYour Claim Form must be completed and be postmarked no later than September 30, 2004 \nFor more information, please read this notice. \n \nIf You Wish to Claim Monetary Compensation, \nObtain, Fill out and Mail the Claim Form as Soon as Possible but No Later than September 30, 2004. \n \nTO: Any person who was booked at the Sacramento County Main Jail between March 14, 2000 and June 6, 2003 on an infraction or misdemeanor \noffense or felony offense not involving violence, drugs or weapons and subjected to a strip search before arraignment. \n \nPLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. \nYOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT. \n \nThere is now pending in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento a class action lawsuit involving a class of persons defined \nas those who were booked at the Sacramento County Main Jail between March 14, 2000, and June 6, 2003, on an infraction or misdemeanor offense or \nfelony offense not involving violence, drugs or weapons and subjected to a strip search before arraignment.  \n \nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a potential class member, your rights may be affected by the \nsettlement.  This Notice also summarizes the terms and effect of the proposed settlement, what you can do to participate in it, how you can obtain money \nunder the settlement and what you must do if you choose to exclude yourself from the class.   \n \nSUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TERMS\n \nA Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) was entered into after several months of intensive negotiations between the parties, conducted with the \nassistance of a third party mediation.  The Parties are requesting that the Court Approve the Settlement.   \n \nA.  Parties to the Settlement.\n \nThe parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiffs named in Bull, et al v. County of Sacramento, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento Case \nNo. 01AS01545 on behalf of themselves and the Settlement Class, and various defendants including the County of Sacramento.  Counsel for the class is Mark E. \nMerin, The Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, Sacramento, CA  95814.  \n \nB.  Monetary Terms of Settlement\n \n1.  Class Fund and Related Expenses.   \n \nDefendants shall pay a maximum of $15,000,000 under the terms of the settlement which will hereafter be referred to as the Class Fund.   \n \nClass Counsel shall seek an award of up to $3,000,000 of the Class Fund as attorney’s fees and costs for recovering the Class Fund for the Class \nMembers.  Up to $500,000 of the Class Fund may be used for costs of claims administration.  Up to $11,500,000 may be used to pay valid claims.  \n \n2.  Payments to Class Members Who File Claims.\n \nMoney for the class will be paid out based on a distribution formula, subject to payments being proportionately reduced if the total value of verified claims \nexceeds $11,500,000. Pursuant to that distribution formula each Claimant will receive a minimum Tier-1 payment of $1,000 (One Thousand Dollars) \nupon confirmation that the Claimant is a Class Member.  In order to receive this payment, the Claimant need not do anything other than submit a valid \nClaim Form.   \n \nClaimants may also receive an additional Tier-2 payment of up to $3,500.00 (Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars).  In order to receive this payment, \nthe Claimant must answer Questions 1-10 included in the Claim form.  Also, the Claimant must submit a written description of the circumstances \nsurrounding the strip-search and/or provide documentation which supports those contentions.  Complete instructions regarding the written description \nand/or type of documentation which will be required are included in the Claim Form.   \n \nClaimants may also receive an additional Tier-3 payment of up to $25,000.00 (Twenty Five Thousand Dollars) for physical or psychological injury \nresulting from the strip-search.  In order to receive a Tier-3 payment, the Claimant must answer questions 11-13 in the Claim form, provide medical \ndocumentation supporting a Tier-3 payment and agree to submit to an examination under oath by an attorney for the County of Sacramento.  \n \nC.  Your Options as a Class Member.\n \n1.  Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\n \nTo qualify for a payment, you must send in a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. A Claim Form is included in this notice package. You can also \nget a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll free number: 1-800-706-8584; (2) requesting a Claim Form from the office of Class Counsel at: The Law Office of Mark \n\nE. Merin, 2001 P Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, telephone (916) 443-6911; or (3) writing the Claims Administrator at: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, \nc/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \n \nYou have until September 30, 2004 to submit a claim or opt -out of the settlement. \n \nMail your completed Claim Form to: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \n \nIf you need assistance in completing the claim form, feel free to contact class counsel, Mark E. Merin at the Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, \nSuite 100, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 443-6911.  A minimal fee may be charged for assistance in completing and submitting the form. \n \nRemember, if you do not send a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. Also, please note that Class Members who have already settled their claims \nwith the County of Sacramento or gone to trial with the County of Sacramento cannot receive a payment under this settlement.  If you submit a Claim \nForm, you will be bound by the Settlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you do not submit a Claim form but do not exclude yourself \nfrom the class (as explained by the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and dismissal entered in this case, but you will not \nreceive any money. \n \nBy participating in the Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to June 6, 2003, related to strip searches by the Defendants in this case, even \nthose of which you are not aware of at present.  This waiver will include a waiver of the provisions of California Civil Code §1542, which provides that “a general \nrelease does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him \nmust have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”  By participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the litigation. \n \n2.  Exclude Yourself From the Class.\n \nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude yourself, you can not get a \npayment and you can not object to the Settlement. Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion \nletter that states that you want to be excluded from Bull, et al. v. County of Sacramento, et. al., Court File No. 01AS01545. Your exclusion letter must be \nreceived before September 30, 2004.  Mail or deliver it to: Clerk of the Court, Sacramento County Superior Court, Dept. 39, 720 Ninth Street, \nSacramento, CA 95814.   \n \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you can not get any money from the \nSettlement and you can not tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”). If you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the \nclass or the Settlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit against the County of Sacramento about the claims in this case. \n \nD.  Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections. \n \nA fairness hearing will be held on October 22, 2004 at Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA \n95814 in Department 39.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can tell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it \nat this hearing. This is called objecting to the Settlement. For example, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will \nconsider your views.  \n \nTo object, you must file a document with the court that contains all of the following: (1) The name and title of the lawsuit, Bull, et al. v. County of \nSacramento, Court File No. 01AS01545; (2) A statement of each objection you have and the facts that support the objections; (3) A description of any \nlaw or case supporting the objections; (4) A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will ask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your \nobjections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and (5) Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness \nHearing. \n \nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of attorney’s fees and \ncosts of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING ON OR BEFORE October 22, 2004, IN \nTHE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO INDICATED ABOVE, LOCATED AT 720 9TH STREET, \nSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, 95814, ATTN: CLERK, RE: BULL, ET AL V. COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO SETTLEMENT, CASE NO.  01AS01545.  If \nyou wish to appear and present your objections at the fairness hearing, you must also submit a Notice of Intention to Appear that identifies the case, \ncontains your name and address, and explains the reason the appearance is desired.  The Notice of Intention to Appear and any objections must be filed \nwith the Court on or before September 30, 2004.  You may be represented by your own attorney.  If you are to be represented by an attorney at the \nhearing, his or her name, address and telephone number must be included in the Notice of Intention to Appear as well.   \n \nA copy of the Statement of Objection and/or Notice of Intention to Appear must also be mailed to: (1) The Law Office of Mark E. Merin, 2001 P Street, \nSacramento, CA  95814 ATTN: Mark E. Merin: and (2) Porter, Scott, Weiberg and Delehant, P.O. Box 255428, Sacramento, CA 95865, ATTN: Terrence \nCassidy. \n \nE.  How to Obtain Further Information\n \nFor additional information regarding the Settlement, or to obtain a copy of the Settlement Agreement, Notice or Court Orders, you or your counsel should \ncontact: Bull, et al. Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110.  You may also check the \nClass Administrator’s website at www.bullvsac.com or call 1-800-706-8584.  You may also obtain detailed information about the case by examining the \nCourt file located in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Sacramento, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. \n \nF.

Merin, jointly move with defendants herein, County of Sacramento, Sacramento County Sheriff Lou \n5  Blanas and Does 1 through 50, by and through their counsel, Terence J. Cassidy of Porter, Scott, Weiberg \n6  & Delehant, for this court's preliminary approval of the class action settlement so that notice may be given \n7  to the class and a fairness hearing on the proposed settlement scheduled with distribution of the settlement \n8  funds if the court approves the settlement at that fairness hearing. \n9  Judicial preliminary approval of a class action settlement is provided for in Rule 1859( c) of the \n10  California Rules of Court. \n11  Any party to a settlement agreement may submit a written notice of motion \nfor preliminary approval of the settlement.  The settlement agreement and \n12  proposed notice to class members must be filed with the motion, and the \nproposed order must be lodged with the motion. \n13 \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS/HISTORY OF LITIGATION \n14 \n15  A.  Facts \n16  On March 14,2000, seven plaintiffs were arrested at a Board of Forestry hearing in Sacramento, \n17  California, on minor misdemeanor charges and transported to the Sacramento County Jail where they \n18  were subj ected to strip searches, in groups.  They were required to expose their genitalia for inspection \n19  and, during those searches, were able to see and could be seen by other arrestees being searched. \n20  On September 14,2000, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated, filed a \n21  group government tort claim against the County of Sacramento, Sheriff Lou Blanas and unknown \n22  Sheriffs Deputies alleging the strip searches they underwent violated their statutory and constitutional \n23  rights and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. \n24  Notice ofrejection of plaintiffs , claim was received on September 27,2000, and on March 13, \n25  2001, plaintiffs, on behalf ofthemselves and all those similarly situated, filed a class action complaint \n26  alleging defendants' strip search policies violated plaintiffs' state and federal constitutional rights and \nMARY BULL, et at. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et at  2  Sacramento County Superior Court No. GlASa 1545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\ne  e \n1  California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits strip searches of persons arrested on infractions or \n2  misdemeanor charges not involving drugs, weapons or violence, unless there is reasonable suspicion to \n3  believe that a search would be productive of contraband, and requires that all strip searches be performed \n4  outside of the view of persons not participating in the searches. \n5  For two and a half years the parties vigorously litigated the various issues raised in the litigation \n6  and engaged in extensive discovery, described more particularly below, following which they agreed to \n7  mediate the dispute before the Honorable Raul Ramirez.  Beginning in late August 2003, the parties have \n8  met for 13 days of mediation and negotiated the settlement described herein which they now present to the \n9  court for approval. \n10  B.  History of the Litigation \n11  Following initial discovery, plaintiffs moved for redesignation of the complaint as Class IT and, on \n12  November 7,2001, moved for certification of the complaint as a class action on behalf of all persons \n13  arrested on infractions or misdemeanors not involving drugs, weapons or violence and strip searched at \n14  the Sacramento County Jail prior to arraignment.  Following several hearings, issuance of tentative \n15  rulings, and motions for reconsideration, the court approved certification of the action as a class action in \n16  March 2002.  (An index of all pleadings filed by the parties is attached hereto as Exhibit \"1\".) \n17  On November 19, 2002, plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication on all plaintiffs' claims and on \n18  defendants' affirmative defenses.  On November 26,2002, defendants filed their cross-motion for \n19  summary judgment.  On January 3,2003, the court issued its ruling on the cross-motions and found that \n20  defendants were liable to the class of plaintiffs for strip searches in violation of Penal Code § 4030 and the \n21  California Constitution, and held that each plaintiff was entitled to minimum statutory damages of $1,000. \n22  (A copy of Judge Thomas Cecil's decision is attached hereto as Exhibit \"2\".) \n23  Central to the plaintiffs' case was proof of the defendants' policy of strip searching, in groups, all \n24  persons whom they intended to house in the Jail's general population.  The Jail's policies have been \n25  revised, effective June 6, 2003, so that group searches no longer occur, and pre-arraignment detainees arc \n26 \nMARY BULL, et al. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al.  3  Sacramento Coullty Superior Court No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINAR Y APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\ne  e \n1  searched only ifthere is reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing contraband or weapons, that a \n2  search would produce that contraband, and the strip search is approved, in writing, by a supervisor. \n3  Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings and filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal \n4  in an attempt to have the class action decertified.  The motion was denied and the writ was denied. \n5  On February 20,2003, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the within action with a \n6  similar action styled Hale v.  County ofS acramento in which Ms. Hale, arrested on a misdemeanor battery \n7  charge, was strip searched prior to arraignment. \n8  On March 25,2003, plaintiffs filed a federal action on behalf of all those persons arrested for non-\n9  violent, non-drug or weapons related offenses who were subj ected to strip searches at the Sacramento \n10  County Main Jail prior to arraignment in violation of federal rights which were not included in the state \n11  court litigation, since the federal claims were dismissed by Judge Cecil in response to defendants' motion \n12  for summary adjudication.  Defendants moved to dismiss the federal claim on the grounds of res judicata, \n13  but the court permitted plaintiffs to amend their complaint to include those plaintiffs whose claims were \n14  not pending before the state court.  That order has been stayed, pursuant to stipulation of the parties, \n15  pending the results of the mediation of this state strip search class action. \n16  The parties have stipulated that the class, as originally certified, may be expanded to include all \n17  misdemeanants as well as those persons who could be proper parties to the federal action.  The expanded \n18  class will include persons arrested during the relevant period and charged with felonies not involving \n19  drugs, weapons, or violence and strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail prior to arraignment. \n20  As originally certified, the class was limited to persons arrested on misdemeanors or infractions, \n21  not involving drugs, violence or weapons.  The class has been expanded, by stipulation, to include all \n22  persons arrested during the relevant period on infractions or misdemeanor charges who were strip \n23  searched at the Sacramento County Jail prior to arraignment and all persons arrested on felony charges not \n24  involving drugs, weapons or violence who were strip searched prior to arraignment.  The class has been \n25  expanded because defendants had the practice of strip searching people in groups and such persons could \n26  claim damages under the state and federal Constitutions for such treatment.  Since the class has been \nMARY BULL, et at v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al  4  Sacramento County Superior Court No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  expanded, all persons in the class are being given an opportunity to opt out of the settlement even though \n2  such notices and an opportunity to opt out were earlier given to the narrower class originally certified. \n3  The parties have engaged in extensive discovery to establish the relevant policies and practices, \n4  and to determine the number and identity of persons in the class.  (An index of the discovery practice is \n5  attached hereto as Exhibit \"3\".) \n6  III.  SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW \n7  A.  State law: \n8  1.  Penal Code § 4030: \n9  Penal Code § 4030 was enacted with the express intent to protect the state and federal \n10  constitutional rights of pre-arraignment arrestees detained for minor offenses.  (Penal Code § 4030(a).) \n11  Penal Code § 4030(f) prohibits visual body cavity searches and strip searches of pre-arraignment arrestees \n12  \"held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled \n13  substances, or violence,\" unless \"a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion based on \n14  specific and articulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and the strip \n15  search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband.\"  The subsection further provides that no \n16  strip search may be conducted without the prior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty and \n17  that the authorization \"shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which the \n18  reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.\" \n19  Penal Code § 4030(m) provides that all strip searches \"shall be conducted in an area of privacy so \n20  that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the search.\" \n21  Penal Code § 4030(p) provides that any person who suffers damages as a result of a violation of \n22  4030 may recover actual damages or $1,000, which ever is greater, in addition to other relief the court \n23  may award, including reasonable attorney's fees. \n24  2.  California Constitution: \n25  Article I, § 1 ofthe California Constitution states that privacy is an inalienable right.  In Hill v. \n26  National Collegiate Athletic Association, 7 Ca1.4th 1,26 Ca1.Rptr. 834 (1994), the California Supreme \n:tv£ARY BULL, et al. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al.  5  Sacramento County Superior Court No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELlMINAR Y APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  Court set out clear and detailed guidelines for courts to follow in addressing alleged violations of \n2  California's Right to Privacy. \n3  On summary adjudication, the Honorable Thomas Cecil found that defendants' violated the \n4  California State Constitutional rights of all persons who were strip searched in groups or without \n5  reasonable suspicion to believe they were concealing contraband and that a strip search would result in the \n6  discovery of such contraband. \n7  3.  Federal Law: \n8  Since 1979 when the Supreme Court decided Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, \n9  1884 (1979), the court has held that routine visual body cavity inspections of pre-trial detainees must be \n10  \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, and that the determination of whether a challenged search is \n11  reasonable requires a balancing test: \n12  ... balancing of a need for the particular search against the intrusion of \npersonal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of the \n13  particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for \ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \n14 \n15  441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. \n16  The Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit has found visual body cavity searches to be \n17  unreasonable and unconstitutional since 1984.  In that year, the Ninth Circuit applied the test of \n18  reasonableness to a strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee at a county jail and held that a pre-\n19  arraignment strip search for a person arrested for a minor offense is unconstitutional absent an \n20  individualized suspicion that such arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or is suffering from a \n21  communicable disease.  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,619 (9th Cir. 1984).  The fact that an arrestee \n22  might ultimately be intermingled with the general popUlation did not, by itself, justify a strip search, as \n23  such intermingling at the pre-arraignment stage was found to be \"both limited and avoidable.\"  rd. 745 \n24  F.2d at 618. \n25  In 1988, the Ninth Circuit decided Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th \n26  Cir. 1990).  There, plaintiff was arrested and charged with grand theft, a felony, after a dispute with a \nMARY BULL, et al. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et at  6  Sacramento County Superior COUlt No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROY AL OF SETTLEME!'JT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  roommate concerning ownership of a T.V.  She was stripped and subjected to a visual body cavity search \n2  after she was booked and before she was placed in the general population.  In that case the court found \n3  that a blanket policy that subjected all felony arrestees to a visual body cavity search upon booking in the \n4  county jail was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, in that the felony/misdemeanor classification was \n5  not \"reasonably related to the institution's obj ective of maintaining security.\"  901 F .2d at 714. \n6  In 1992, the Ninth Circuit decided ActUp/IPortland v. Bagley, 971 F2d. 298 (9th Cir. 1992). \n7  There, the court summarized the rule regarding strip searches as follows: \n8  At the time appellees were searched, it was clearly established in this circuit \nthat it is unlawful to strip search an arrestee brought to ajail facility on \n9  charges of committing a minor offense, unless the officer directing the \nsearch possesses a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is \n10  carrying or concealing contraband.  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,617 \n(9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114.  Reasonable \n11  suspicion may be based on \"such factors as the nature of the offense, the \narrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.\"  Id. \n12  Adhering to the Supreme Court's direction in Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n529,99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884 (1979), the Giles test accounts for the fact that \n13  local jail facilities frequently confront difficult security problems, and \nbalances those facility's interests in controlling such problems against the \n14  privacy interests of arrestees.  See, 746 F .2d at 617. \n15  917 F.2d at 301. \n16  The court in ActUp/IPortland v. Bagley, supra, noted that arrestees were strip searched \"in a semi-\n17  public area, observed by other deputy marshals and other individuals also in federal custody.\"  Abhorring \n18  such lack of privacy, the court stated that \"the Fourth Amendment requires that any strip search be \n19  conducted in a reasonable manner, and accordingly the officers must respect arrestees' privacy interests.\" \n20  4.  California Class Action Law: \n21  Class actions in California are generally governed by Code of Civil Procedure § 382 which \n22  authorizes class actions in \"suits of common or general interest\" as follows: \n23  If the consent of anyone who should have been joined as a plaintiff camlot \nbe obtained, he may be made a defendant, the reason thereof being stated in \n24  the complaint; and when the question is one of common or general interest, \nof many persons, or when the parties are numerous or it is impracticable to \n25  bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the \nbenefit of all. \n26 \nMARY DULL, ct at. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al.  7  Sacramento County Superior CQUlt No. OIASOIS45 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  Because Code of Civ. Proc. § 382 does not establish specific statutory requirements for class \n2  actions, the California Supreme Court has \"urged trial courts to be procedurally innovative, encouraging \n3  them to incorporate procedures from outside sources in determining to allow the maintenance of a \n4  particular suit.  More specifically, we have directed them to Rule 23 of the Federal-Rules of Civil \n5  Procedure.\"  City o/San Jose v. Superior Court,  12 Ca1.3d 447,453,115 Cal.Rptr. 797  (1974). \n6  Class action certification under Federal Rule 23 has been the preferred method for dealing with \n7  cases challenging blanket jail pre-arraignment strip search policies.  See, Smith v. Montgomery County, \n8  573 F.Supp. 604 (Dist. MD 1983); Mackv. Suffolk County, 191 F.RD. 16 (Dist. Mass 2000); Nielsen v. \n9  York County, 219 F.RD. 19 (Dist. Maine 2003); Tardiffv. Knox County, 218 F.RD. 332 (Dist. Maine \n10  2003); Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 128 F.R.D. 93 (ND Ill. 1989); Marybeth G v. City o/Chicago, 723 \n11  F.2d 1263, 1267, fn.2 (7th Cir. 1983); Maneely v. City o/Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (SD NY 2002). \n12  On April 9, 2004, the First District Court of Appeal in Tardiffv. Knox County, et al., consolidated \n13  with Nielsen v. York County, et al., upheld the certification of two blanket strip search cases under Federal \n14  Rule 23(b)(3).  See, Slip Opinion attached hereto as Exhibit \"4\". \n15  The advantages of certification in blanket strip search cases is manifest where the common issues \n16  of law or fact predominate over individual issues.  In the cases before this court for preliminary approval \n17  of the proposed settlement, the benefits to the parties include; for defendants a complete settlement of all \n18  claims of persons in the class with claims for damages arising during the period from March 14, 2000, to \n19  June 6, 2003, the date on which new policies protecting pre-arraignments' interests were implemented, \n20  and obtaining res judicata effect ofthe settlement.  For the plaintiffs, the settlement of the class action \n21  provides a fund adequate to pay claims of all those persons submitting the requisite claim form and \n22  substantiating documentation at a level at or above the minimum payment to which they would otherwise \n23  be entitled if they had established their individual entitlement to damages under the relevant statutes, \n24  without the consumption of time and uncertainty litigation entails. \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \n~.1ARY BULL, et at. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al.  8  Sacramento County Superior Court No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\nIV.  OUTLINE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n1 \n2  A.  Purpose: \n3  The purpose of the proposed settlement is fully and finally to resolve all claims for damages which \n4  any person strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail, prior to arraignment, during the period from \n5  March 14, 2000, through and including June 6, 2003, might have under applicable state and federal \n6  statutory and constitutional law; to provide adequate compensation for each such person; to ensure that \n7  defendants, once the settlement funds have been distributed, shall be fully and finally relieved of all \n8  further liability to any persons in the class and bound by the court's final judgment; and to provide a \n9  mechanism by which persons wishing to opt out of the proposed settlement either to abandon their claims \n10  or to prosecute them in their own behalf, or to challenge the fairness of the proposed settlement, may do \n11  so. \n12  . To accomplish the above-stated purposes, the parties have entered into extensive negotiations, \n13  facilitated by mediator former federal judge, Raul Ramirez and negotiated a proposed settlement, a copy \n14  of which is attached hereto as Exhibit \"5\". \n15  The principle provisions of the attached settlement are the following: \n16  B.  Description of Class Members \n17  The class certified by the Sacramento County Superior Court was all persons arrested on \n18  infractions or misdemeanor charges not involving drugs, weapons or violence, who were strip searched \n19  prior to arraignment on such charges without a peace officer having reasonable suspicion to believe that a \n20  strip search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Because, on summary adjudication, the court \n21  held that all persons strip searched in groups in violation of Penal Code § 4030(m) also suffered a \n22  violation of their rights entitling them to minimum damages, and because federal law does not distinguish \n23  between misdemeanor and felony arrests, the class definition, by stipulation, has been expanded herein to \n24  apply to all misdemeanants strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail during the relevant period. \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \nMARY BULL, et al. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, ct al.  S3cramcnto county Superior Couli :--10. 01 ASOl545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMlNAR Y APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  The allegations in the pending federal complaint are broad enough, relying upon federal law, to \n2  include persons charged with felonies not involving drugs, weapons, or violence and strip searched, prior \n3  to arraignment, at the Sacramento County Jail from March 7, 2002, through June 6, 2003. \n4  In order to include and bind all persons strip searched prior to arraignment at the Sacramento \n5  County Jail who could conceivably have claims against defendants, the parties have stipulated that the \n6  following persons will qualify for participation in the class of claimants eligible to submit claim forms: \n7  All persons arrested on infractions and/or misdemeanors and strip searched \nat the Sacramento County Jail prior to arraignment, between March 14, \n8  2000, and June 6, 2003, and all persons arrested on felonies not involving \nviolence, drugs or weapons who were strip searched at the Sacramento \n9  County Jail prior to arraignment between March 14,2000, and June 6, 2003. \n10  Because the settlement class has been expanded over that certified, the settlement provides for notice to \n11  all class members of their right to opt out of the class even though an earlier notice of that right was given \n12  to the class as previously defined. \n13  C.  Compensation provided by settlement: \n14  While the vast majority of persons strip searched prior to arraignment at the Sacramento County \n15  Jail underwent a perfunctory group search, many persons experienced particularly damaging treatment or \n16  were in categories making them particularly vulnerable to the indignities and humiliation of a strip search \n17  and of a search performed in a group where the person search could be observed by others and, in turn, \n18  could observe other inmates being strip searched. \n19  The proposed settlement provides three tiers of payments which will be made based on review of \n20  answers provided on claim forms submitted by class members and on the basis of a database maintained \n21  by defendants. \n22  Tier 1:  Persons in the class who were strip searched during the relevant period at the Sacramento \n23  County Jail will receive $1,000.  Ifa claimant was strip searched more than once, the claimant will receive \n24  $1,000 for a second strip search and $500 for a third strip search, for a maximum possible total of$2,500. \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \nMARY BULL, et.1. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et.1.  10  Sacramento County Superior Court No. OlASOl545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n-------------------------------~-~--------------\n1  Tier 2:  If, in addition to experiencing a strip search at the Sacramento County Jail, the claimant is \n2  in any of the following categories, points valued at $250 each will be awarded: \n•  under age 21 or over age 60 - 2 points; \n3 \n4  •  physical or mental disability - 2 points; \n5  •  obese (according to chart) - 2 points; \n6  •  pregnant - 4 points; \n7  •  required to remove religious garments - 2 points; \n8  •  required to remove piercing in private areas - 2 points; \n9  •  required to retract foreskin - 2 points; \n10  •  required to remove hair extensions - I point; \n•  menstruating female - 4 points; \n11 \n12  •  observed by persons of the opposite sex - 2 points; \n13  •  touched in a private area - 4 points; \n14  •  subjected to foul, demeaning language or nasty jokes - 2 points; \n15  •  required to bend over and spread buttocks or labia multiple times - 2 points; \n16  •  made to jump/dance during search - 4 points. \n17  The maximum additional payment for persons qualifying for tier 2 payments is $3,500. \n18  Tier 3:  Persons who suffered any of the following will be entitled to additional payments as \n19  follows: \n20  •  forcible strip search - 20 points ($5,000); \n21  •  received counseling with the first event within 90 days of the incident - 10 to 20 \n22  points ($2,500 to $5,000); \n23  •  diagnosed with a psychological injury as a result of the strip search (if first therapy \n24  session or medical appointment was within 90 days of the strip search and the \n25  person attended a total of no less than five therapy or medical appointments) - 30 to \n26  100 points ($7,500 to $25,000); \nMARY BULL, et at v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et al.  11  Sacramento County Superior COll11 No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n•  suffered other significant ill effects of the strip search not included under any \n1 \n2  previous Tier 2 or Tier 3 category - up to 100 points ($25,000). \n3  Tier 1 through 3 awards may be combined for a maximum award of $31 ,000 in addition to an \n4  award of$5,000 if the claimant was subject to a forcible strip search. \n5  D.  Reduction Factors \n6  Claimants sUbmitting verified claims will have their claims reduced according to the formula set \n7  out below if they are in any of the groups for which a reduction of claims has been provided: \nl.  Claimants who were arrested for committing a misdemeanor involving violence, drugs or \n8 \n9  weapons will have any award made to them under Tier 2 or 3 reduced by 50%. \n10  2.  Claimants arrested for committing a felony not involving violence, drugs or weapons will \n11  have any awards made to them under Tier 2 or 3 reduced by 50%, but if the felony arrest occurred \n12  between March 14,2000, and December 31,2001, their entire award will be reduced by 50%. \n3.  Claimants incarcerated in county jailor state prison within five years preceding the first of \n13 \n14  their qualifying strip searches will have awards made under Tier 2 or 3 reduced by 75%. \n15  4.  If a claimant submits a fraudulent claim for payment under certain of the Tier 3 categories \n16  (sought therapy resulting from the strip search; was diagnosed with a psychological injury resulting from \n17  the strip search, or suffered other significant effects from the strip search) no award under Tier 3 will be \n18  permitted. \n19  E.  Process for Claims Submission \n20  Following preliminary approval of the proposed settlement by this court, the parties, through a \n21  retained firm! specializing in class action claim administration, will notify each of the class members of \n22  the terms of the proposed settlement and provide each claimant with a claim form to be completed and \n23  returned within the specified 90 day period.  The notice and claim form, copies of which are attached \n24  hereto as Exhibit \"6\", direct the claimant to answer questions on the form which will determine the \n25 \n26 \n1 The parties have agreed that Gilardi and Company will act as Claims Administrators and are requesting \nthe court appoint them for that purpose. \nMARY BULL, et <11  v COUNTY OF SACRAr..1ENTO, et at.  12  Sacramento County Superior COlll1 No. OlASOl545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELlMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  amount of compensation the claimant will receive.  The claimant's responses are supplemental to \n2  information contained in the database which will be used to determine eligibility for payment and \n3  entitlement to certain additional payments for reasons such as: multiple strip searches and age. \n4  Additionally, the database will be used to apply the reduction factors applicable to a portion of those \n5  claimants submitting claims. \n6  The Claims Administrator will not only mail the notice and claim form to the last known address \n7  of each claimant, but will publish a summary form of the notice in mass media and will make attempts to \n8  locate persons whose claim forms are returned as undeliverable or who are incarcerated, as shown on the \n9  database of persons in jails or prisons within the state of California. \n10  Claim forms will also be available to be downloaded from a website established by the class \n11  Claims Administrator and will be provided by the Claims Administrator or by class counsel in response to \n12  requests for such forms. \n13  The claim form informs the claimant that class counsel will provide assistance to those class \n14  claimants who require it if they contact the offices of class counsel. \n15  Claim forms received by the Claims Administrator by the cut off date for submission of claims \n16  will be examined.  Based on the answers and support provided by the claimant and following comparison \n17  with database information, the Claims Administrator will determine the number of points to be assigned \n18  (dollar value) to the claim.  Claims providing affirmative answers to questions indicating the possibility of \n19  Tier 3 awards will be assigned values and those forms will be reviewed by defendants.  If defendants \n20  challenge any award to Tier 3 payments, counsel for the parties will review the Claims Administrator's \n21  determination to see if they can agree on a valuation.  If they cannot agree, the claim will be referred to the \n22  Special Master for decision which will be binding except in cases where the Special Master reviews a \n23  form which claims damages for a diagnosis for psychological injury resulting from a strip search or a \n24  claim form \"other significant ill effects\" experienced as a result of a strip search.  In those instances, either \n25 \n26 \n:1  The parties propose that Judge Raul Ramirez be appointed as the Special Master.  He has agreed to serve \nin that capacity. \nMARY BULL, et al. y COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et at.  13  Sacramento County Supe!iur Court No. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROY AL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  party may appeal the Special Master's determination to the judge ofthe Sacramento County Superior \n2  Court appointed to hear such appeals from the Special Master's rulings.  The Superior Court Judge's \n3  determination shall be final. \n4  Defense counsel may question claimants submitting documentation for a Tier 3 award and may \n5  require claimants to submit to an agreed medical examiner's examination or to a deposition.  All costs of \n6  such procedures will be born by the defense. \n7  F.  Opt Outs \n8  In the notice to members of the class, information will be provided as to how persons choosing to \n9  \"opt out\" of the class may do so.  Ifmore than 40 claimants opt out of the class, defendants reserve the \n10  right to withdraw from the settlement in which case the matter will be returned to the mediator for further \n11  mediated negotiation and, if those negotiations are not successful, for return to the civil active list for trial. \n12  G.  Settlement Funds for Claimants \n13  Defendants will deposit $11.5 million dollars in an escrow account by June 30, 2004.  Following \n14  the cutoff date for submission of claims and after the resolution of all appeals to the Special Master or to \n15  the Superior Court Judge, the value of all claims will be totaled and settlement checks distributed by the \n16  Claims Administrator.  If the total of all approved claims exceeds the funds available, payments to \n17  claimants will be reduced proportionately and the entire fund exhausted. \n18  If approved claims totalless than $11.5 million dollars, the balance remaining in the fund will \n19  revert to defendants. \n20  H.  Claims Administration Fund \n21  Defendants will deposit $500,000 to cover costs relating to claims administration.  Negotiations \n22  have concluded (although no agreement has been signed) with Gilardi and Company,  a class Claims \n23  Administrator, who has agreed to provide services relating to notification to claimants, receipt of class \n24  claim forms, review and valuation of claims, documentation of action taken, and preparation of periodic \n25  and final accountings.  The Claims Administrator has agreed to cap the cost of these services at an amount \n26  less than the total amount allocated for these services. \nMARY BULL, et al. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et at  14  Silcr~Hnento County Superior Court No. OJAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINAR Y APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  In addition to claims administration costs and expenses, the expenses of the Special Master will be \n2  charged to the class claim fund as expenses relating to Claims Administrator. \n3  I.  Attorneys' Fees \n4  Defendants will deposit $3 million dollars for attorney's fees and costs incurred by class counsel \n5  for representation of representative plaintiffs and class members.  This amount is 20% of the total \n6  settlement which is within the range of attorneys fees awarded in similar cases and substantially less than \n7  the 33%% specified in class counsel's contingency fee agreement with representative plaintiffs. \n8  Plaintiffs' counsel reserve the right to impose a nominal charge to claimants who request assistance to \n9  complete and submit claim forms. \n10  J.  Payment to Representative Plaintiffs \n11  Defendants will allocate $410,000 from the $11.5 million dollars for payment to the individual \n12  named class representative plaintiffs.  This amount will not be subject to proportional reduction in the \n13  even the entire fund available for claims payments is exhausted. \n14  K.  The Settlement is Fair and an Appropriate Method to Resolve this Litigation \n15  As a result of the discovery in this action, the parties agree that approximately 16,100 potential \n16  claimants fall within the definition of the class agreed to by the parties.  Experience from settlement of \n17  other class action strip search cases indicates that it is probable that 25% of the class or fewer will submit \n18  completed claim forms.  Persons who have been strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail comprise a \n19  population difficult to track: many are transient; many may be in custody in various institutions or \n20  facilities; many may want nothing to do with this litigation. \n21  This settlement is structured to compensate persons strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail at \n22  or above the minimum specified in Penal Code § 4030 - $1,000.  Persons strip searched multiple times \n23  will recover up to $2,500 for undergoing the strip searches and may qualify for additional payments (up to \n24  $3,500) if their experience was such as is presumed to be associated with emotional distress or other \n25  general damage. \n,26  \\\\\\ \nMARY BULL, et aJ. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, et aJ.  15  Sacramento County Superior CO\\1li :-In. OlAS01545 \nSTIPULATED MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION \n\n1  Finally, up to an additional $30,000 may be recovered by persons who had other significant \n2  experiences or damages, or underwent forcible strip searches. \n3  These settlement amounts specified herein are above those typically paid in class action cases \n4  because the vast maj ority of persons strip searched at the Sacramento County Jail were strip searched in \n5  groups. \n6  L.  Advantages of Settlement \n7  Many of the persons entitled to compensation under this settlement fall into categories whose \n8  claims could be legally disputed.  Thus, for instance, most strip search cases hold there is per se \n9  reasonable suspicion to strip search persons charged with crimes involving drugs, weapons or violence. \n10  Persons arrested for these crimes are, nonetheless, included in this settlement because they were strip \n11  searched in groups and/or because the crimes for which they were arrested arguably fall outside of the \n12  categories for which reasonable suspicion is presumed. \n13  Even if entitlement to compensation is not disputed, the damages suffered by a person being strip \n14  searched is disputed and the time and expense necessary to resolve that dispute makes settlement at the \n15  levels obtained through this agreement desirable. \n16  Ifthe matter is not settled and proceeds to trial, multiple trials could take years to complete and \n17  appeals thereafter could delay ultimate satisfaction of any judgments for several more years making \n18  settlement and resolution as provided in the accompanying documents desirable and appropriate. \n19  V.  CONCLUSION \n20  For all of the reasons stated herein, represented in the attached documents, and presented at the \n21  hearing of this request for preliminary approval of the settlement, the parties j ointly request the court to \n22  sign the accompanying order to give preliminary approval to the stipulation of settlement, to appoint Hon. \n23  \\\\\\ \n24  \\\\\\ \n25  \\\\\\ \n26  \\\\\\ \nMARY BULL, et at. v COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, ct aI.  16  Sacramento County Superior COUlt 1\\0.
