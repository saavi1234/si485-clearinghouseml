    "summary": "<p>On May 3, 2005, three inmates who had been housed at the San Bernardino County Jail filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the County of San Bernardino and the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by the defendants' policy sanctioning the systematic strip searching of all detainees who pass through the county jail system, regardless of the nature of the crime prompting their detention.  They claimed that the searches occurred in full view of jailors and detainees of the opposite sex, and took place even when the detainee in question had already been ordered released on bail after making an appearance in court.  </p><p>On February 16, 2006, the defendants asked the District Court to dismiss the case.  On March 23, 2006, the District Court (Judge Stephen G. Larson) dismissed the portion of the complaint where the plaintiffs were attempting to sue Sheriff Penrod in his official capacity, and the Court also dismissed the portion of the complaint being brought under the California Constitution.  With regard to the other portions of the complaint, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.  </p><p>On October 11, 2006, the District Court officially certified four plaintiff classes, with a number of sub-classes.  The classes were defined as: 1) pre-arraignment arrestees, 2) court returns entitled to release, 3) challenge to manner in which searches were conducted, and 4) transports.  </p><p>The plaintiff classes asked the court for summary judgment, and on December 7, 2006, the District Court (Judge Larson) partially granted their request, holding that the policy of strip searching arrestees returning from court in a group setting when they were entitled to be released was unreasonable and that the policy of strip-searching pre-arraignment arrestees charged with crimes not involving drugs or violence who were transferred from short-term to long-term jails was also unreasonable.  Craft v. County of San Bernardino, 468 F.Supp.2d 1172 (C.D.Ca. 2006).</p><p>On September 21, 2007, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the District Court.  According to the document, the County of San Bernardino agreed to pay $25,500,000.00 to the plaintiff class in order to fully settle the claims against them.  All fees were to be paid out of this settlement fund.  In addition, the defendants agreed to discontinue strip-searches of arrestees who would fall into any of the certified classes in this lawsuit, and the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims that they had against the defendants.  </p><p>On April 1, 2008, the District Court approved the settlement.  Each claimant will receive $700-800 on average ($50 minimum).  The named plaintiffs will share a total payout of $200,000.  Class attorney's fees were set at $6,325,000 -- 25% of the class damages.</p><p></p>",

All defendants are either California peace officers, or California governmental\n7\nentities, or others whose identities are unknown to plaintiffs. Individual police officer\n8\ndefendants and/or individual Sheriffโs deputies are hereinafter referred to as โpolice\n9\nofficersโ and any governmental entity defendants are referred to by proper name or as\n10\nโgovernmental entity.โ The phrase โDefendantsโ refers to all defendants, including the\n11\nClass defendants.\n12\n13. Defendant County of San Bernardino (โCOUNTYโ) is a political subdivision\n13\nduly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. The SBSD is an\n14\nagency of defendant COUNTY, and all actions of the SBSD are the legal responsibility of\n15\nthe COUNTY.

Defendant SBSD\n19\nis sued both in its own right, and on the basis of respondeat superior under California\n20\nGovernment Code ยง 815.2, and mandatory duties under California Government Code ยง\n21\n815.6.\n22\n15. Defendant Gary Penrod (โPENRODโ) was and is the SBSD Sheriff.  Plaintiffs\n23\nare informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at all times relevant herein PENROD\n24\nwas  responsible  for  the  development,  establishment  and/or  implementation  of  the\n25\n26 procedures, policies, regulations, practices and/or customs of the SBSD with respect to its\n27 detention of prisoners. Upon information and belief, plaintiffs further allege that, at all times\n28 relevant herein, PENROD participated in, approved, and/or ratified the unconstitutional or\n-2-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 illegal acts complained of herein.  Plaintiffs sue PENROD in his individual capacity.\n2 16. Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued herein\n3 as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue these defendants by such fictitious\n4 names.  Plaintiffs will give notice of these defendantsโ  true names and capacities when\n5 ascertained.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that DOE\n6\ndefendants are responsible in some manner for the damages and injuries hereinafter\n7\ncomplained  of.  Plaintiffs  sue  DOE  defendants  in  both  their  individual  and  official\n8\ncapacities.\n9\n17. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at all times relevant\n10\nherein  the  individual  defendants,  and  each  of  them,  were  the  agents,  servants  and\n11\nemployees of defendants SBSD and County, and were acting at all times within the scope\n12\nof their agency and employment, and with the knowledge and consent of their principals\n13\nand employers, the SBSD and County. At all times herein, these defendants, and each of\n14\nthem, were acting under the color of state law.\n15\nIII. CLASS CLAIMS\n16\nALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CLASS CLAIMS. \n17\n18. On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that, in the two years preceding the\n18\nfiling of this action and up until the date of class certification or such other date as the court\n19\nmay set, the strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which they and class members were\n20\nsubjected were done pursuant to defendantsโ policy and practice to indiscriminately search\n21\nall, or a large number of persons being processed into the jail, without regard to: a) The\n22\nnature of their offense or criminal history; b) Whether they are under an order of release or\n23\nnot; c) Whether they have had contact with any persons from outside the County jail system\n24\nwho could reasonably be believed to be a potential source of contraband or weapons; d)\n25\n26 Whether there is cause of any kind to believe they are a potential source of contraband or\n27 weapons;  e)  Whether  there  is  any  other  articulable  justification  for  defendantsโ\n28 indiscriminate strip and/or visual body cavity search policy; or f) Whether they are โpre-\n-3-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 arraignment detainees,โ as that term is used in California Penal Code ยง 4030(b).\n2 19.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants have a policy of not\n3 limiting the persons who can see, or hear, or observe all or part of the strip and/or visual\n4 body cavity searches to those who are necessary to the procedure. Thus, other inmates,\n5 dispensable jail personnel, and possibly others, are able to see or hear some or all of the\n6\nsearches described below.\n7\n20. Plaintiffs timely filed claims against defendants under Government Code ยง910\n8\nfor themselves and others similarly situated.\n9\n21. Plaintiffs suffered, among other things, the indignity of a strip and/or visual body\n10\ncavity search of their persons. As a result of defendantsโ  actions, the plaintiffs suffered\n11\nphysical intrusion, humiliation, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other physical\n12\nand emotional injuries in an amount to be proven at trial.\n13\nCLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE CRAFT\n14\n22. On or about August 29, 2003, and during the class period, SBSD personnel\n15\narrested plaintiff CRAFT on a charge of violating Cal. Penal Code ยง 459 (burglary). SBSD\n16\npersonnel transported CRAFT to the San Bernardino Jail, Central Detention Center where\n17\nupon her arrival, SBSD personnel subjected her to an intrusive strip/visual body cavity\n18\nsearch. At the time of the searches, SBSD personnel did not have probable cause or\n19\nreasonable suspicion that CRAFT was in the possession of contraband, weapon or any\n20\nother substance that would justify or necessitate the strip/visual body cavity search. While\n21\nplaintiff CRAFT was were subjected to this search, she was not provided privacy.\n22\nMoreover, persons whose presence was not required were able to observe plaintiff as she\n23\nwas searched.\n24\n23. On or about September 4, 11, 15, 22, October 24, 31, November 14, 21, and\n25\n26 December 22, 2003, while in SBSD custody plaintiff CRAFT appeared in the San\n27 Bernardino Superior Court on the above criminal charge. After the court appearance SBSD\n28 returned CRAFT to the Central Detention Center. Upon her return plaintiff CRAFT, along\n-4-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 with other inmates, were forced to disrobe and submit to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n2 search in a hallway, without privacy and in the presence and view of other inmates and\n3 visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or necessary to the search. At the time of the\n4 search, SBSD personnel did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that CRAFT\n5 and the other inmates were in the possession of contraband or any other substance that\n6\nwould justify or necessitate the strip and/or visual body cavity searches. The searches were\n7\nviewed by other inmates and SBSD personnel whose presence was not required. During\n8\nthe searches SBSD personnel subjected plaintiff CRAFT and the other inmates to abusive,\n9\ndegrading and harassing comments and other indignities.\n10\nCLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE SANCHEZ. \n11\n24. On or about August 30, 2004, SANCHEZ was in federal custody.  On that date,\n12\na bond was posted thereby entitling SANCHEZ to release from federal incarceration.\n13\nBecause of an outstanding state warrant, SANCHEZ was released into the custody of\n14\ndefendant SBSD.  SBSD incarcerated SANCHEZ in the San Bernardino County Jail.  Upon\n15\nSANCHEZโS arrival at the jail, SBSD employees subjected SANCHEZ to an intrusive strip\n16\nand visual body cavity search.  During the search, SBSD employees required SANCHEZ\n17\nto remove all of her clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing her anus.  The strip and\n18\nvisual body cavity search took place in the presence of other inmates who were also\n19\nsubjected to intrusive strip and visual body cavity searches.  While they were subjected to\n20\nthese searches SANCHEZ and the other prisoners were not provided privacy as required\n21\nby state law. At the time of the searches SBSD personnel did not have probable cause or\n22\nreasonable suspicion that SANCHEZ or the other prisoners were in the possession of\n23\ncontraband or any other substance that would justify or necessitate the strip and visual body\n24\ncavity searches. \n25\n26 25. On or about September 9, 2004, SBSD personnel transported SANCHEZ to the\n27 San Bernardino Superior Court.  While at the courthouse, SANCHEZ remained in SBSD\n28 custody.  Upon SANCHEZโS return from the courthouse to the San Bernardino County\n-5-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 Jail, SANCHEZ, along with other inmates returning to the jail from the courthouse, were\n2 subjected to intrusive strip and visual body cavity searches.  SANCHEZ and the other\n3 inmates were forced to disrobe in a hallway, without privacy from other inmates.  At the\n4 time of the search, SBSD personnel did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion\n5 that SANCHEZ and the other inmates were in the possession of contraband or any other\n6\nsubstance that would justify or necessitate the strip and/or visual body cavity searches.\n7\n26. During the searches SBSD personnel subjected plaintiff SANCHEZ and the other\n8\ninmates to abusive, degrading and harassing comments and other indignities.\n9\nCLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE RYAN.\n10\n27. In December 2004, plaintiff RYAN was incarcerated in the Kern County Jail on\n11\na probation violation.  Her scheduled release date was on or about December 16, 2004.\n12\nInstead of releasing her on December 16, the Kern County Jail kept her in custody on a\n13\nwarrant issued from San Bernardino County for one โKaren Willis.โ RYAN was not, and\n14\nhas never been, the subject of this warrant, and said so when she was informed that she\n15\nwould be transferred to the San Bernardino County Jail.\n16\n28. On or about December 21, 2004, pursuant to the purported authority of the Karen\n17\nWillis warrant, RYAN was transferred to the San Bernardino Jail, West Valley Detention\n18\nCenter, in Rancho Cucamonga.  Upon RYANโS arrival at the jail, SBSD personnel knew\n19\nor should have known that RYAN was not the subject of the warrant. Notwithstanding that\n20\nfact, SBSD proceeded to book RYAN on the warrant. Moreover, plaintiff RYAN is\n21\ninformed and believes and based thereon alleges that SBSD personnel failed and/or refused\n22\nto notify the superior court that RYAN was not the subject of the warrant.\n23\n29. At West  Valley Detention Center, SBSD employees subjected RYAN to an\n24\nintrusive strip and/or visual body cavity searches.  During the search, SBSD employees\n25\n26 required RYAN to remove all her clothing, and to bend and squat, exposing her anus.\n27 While she was subjected to this search, RYAN was not provided privacy as required by\n28 state law. At the time of the search, SBSD personnel did not have probable cause or\n-6-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 reasonable suspicion that RYAN was in the possession of contraband or any other\n2 substance that would justify or necessitate the strip and/or visual body cavity search.\n3 During the search SBSD personnel subjected plaintiff RYAN to abusive, degrading and\n4 harassing comments and other indignities.\n5 30. On December 22, 2004, in the presence of SBSD personnel plaintiff RYAN\n6\nagain complained that she was not the subject of the warrant, and gave her true name and\n7\nbirthdate. Notwithstanding that complaint, SBSD failed and refused to investigate her\n8\ncomplaint or utilize the readily available information that would have established that\n9\nRYAN was not the warrantโs subject. Consequently, SBSD kept RYAN in custody.\n10\n31. On December 29, 2004, SBSD transported RYAN to the San Bernardino\n11\nSuperior Court in Big Bear, California. At that point the court ordered SBSD to release\n12\nplaintiff RYAN, which it did, because plaintiff was not the warrantโs subject. SBSD\n13\nreleased plaintiff in Big Bear in the snow, without funds or other means to secure\n14\ntransportation to her residence in Bakersfield, California.\n15\nCLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE FROST\n16\n32. On or about April 16, 2005, Adelanto police officers arrested FROST on a\n17\nwarrant for a failure to appear in court. In the underlying criminal case, FROST was\n18\ncharged with a misdemeanor violation of Cal. Penal Code ยง148(a)(1). Thereafter, officers\n19\ntransported her to the West Valley Detention Center where, upon processing into the jail,\n20\nshe was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search with other women in a\n21\nhallway without privacy and in the presence and view of other inmates and visible to\n22\nSheriffโs personnel not involved in or necessary to the search. FROST was strip searched\n23\neven though the deputies did not have reasonable suspicion that she was in possession of\n24\ncontraband or weapons.\n25\n26 33. On or about April 19, 2005, while in the custody of the SBSD FROST was\n27 transferred to the West Valley Detention Center. Upon processing into the jail, she was\n28 strip searched with other women in a hallway without privacy and in the presence and view\n-7-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 of other inmates and visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or necessary to the\n2 search. FROST was strip searched even though the deputies did not have reasonable\n3 suspicion that she was in possession of contraband or weapons.\n4 34. On April 25, 2005, FROST, in SBSD custody, was transported from the West\n5 Valley Detention Center to the San Bernardino Superior Court. Before departure from the\n6\nDetention Center, SBSD personnel conducted a strip and/or visual body cavity search on\n7\nFROST along with other women in a hallway in a hallway without privacy and in the\n8\npresence and view of other inmates and visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or\n9\nnecessary to the search. FROST and the others were searched even though the deputies did\n10\nnot have reasonable suspicion that the women were in possession of contraband or\n11\nweapons.\n12\n35.When FROST appeared in the San Bernardino Superior Court, Criminal Case No.\n13\nMVI043101, on April 25, 2005 the court sentenced FROST to the time she had already\n14\nserved, and ordered her release.  Sheriffโs deputies then took custody of FROST, returned\n15\nher to the West Valley Detention Center where, upon arrival, she was subjected to a strip\n16\nand/or visual body cavity with other women in a hallway without privacy and in the\n17\npresence and view of other inmates and visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or\n18\nnecessary to the search. The day following the search, SBSD officials released FROST\n19\nfrom custody.\n20\n36. During the searches SBSD personnel subjected plaintiff FROST and the other\n21\ninmates to abusive, degrading and harassing comments and other indignities.\n22\nClaim of Class Representative HARDY\n23\n37. On March 13, 2005, plaintiff HARDY surrendered himself to the SBSD at its\n24\nVictorville on a warrant issued from Mono County seeking his arrest. The warrant was for\n25\n26 allegedly violating a restraining order, and an alleged failure to appear.  \n27 38. In the early morning hours of March 14, 2005, while in SBSD custody Hardy\n28 was transported from the Victorville station to the West Valley Detention Center. Upon\n-8-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 processing into the jail, he was strip searched with other men in a long hallway off the\n2 transportation entrance.  HARDY was strip searched even though the deputies did not have\n3 reasonable suspicion that he was in possession of contraband or weapons.\n4 39. HARDY was searched as one of a group of about forty to forty-five inmates.\n5 There was no privacy. Plaintiff HARDY and the other inmates were forced to take off all\n6\ntheir clothes and, facing the guards, raise their hands, stick out their tongues, and lift their\n7\ngenitals.  They were forced to turn around and, with their backs to the guards, bend over,\n8\nspread their buttocks, and cough three times. HARDY and the other inmates were forced\n9\nto stand shoulder to shoulder, naked, touching the inmate on either side.  Only about seven\n10\nor eight deputies were involved in the search.  However, many more deputies not involved\n11\nin the search were present and observed the search. Even though this was a search of male\n12\ninmates, female deputies were present and observed the search.  Inmates not being\n13\nsearched were also present as they moved between holding cells and the transportation\n14\narea. During the search, four trustees were present bringing in bedding and clothing. There\n15\nwas also a large window in the hallway through which the search could be observed.\n16\nThroughout the search, the deputies were yelling at the inmates, calling them โassholes.โ\n17\nSome deputies roughed up a few inmates.\n18\n40. On March 15, 2005, Hardy, in the custody of law enforcement officials, departed\n19\nthe West Valley Detention Center. Before departing the facility Hardy was again strip\n20\nsearched even though the deputies did not have reasonable suspicion that he was in\n21\npossession of contraband or weapons.\n22\n23 CLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE WELCH.\n41. On or about July 11, 2005, Adelanto police officers arrested plaintiff WELCH\n24\non a warrant for failure to appear in court.  The warrant was issued out of a criminal case\n25\n26 charging WELCH with driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  The next\n27 day, July 12, 2005, officers transported her to the West Valley Detention Center where,\n28 upon processing into the jail, she along with other women were subjected to a strip and/or\n-9-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 visual body cavity search in a hallway without privacy and in the presence and view of\n2 other inmates and visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or necessary to the search.\n3 Plaintiff WELCH and the other women were searched even though the deputies did not\n4 have reasonable suspicion that the women were in possession of contraband or weapons.\n5 42. On July 25, 2005, WELCH, in SBSD custody at the West Valley Detention\n6\nCenter, was transported from the jail to the San Bernardino Superior Court for an\n7\nappearance in Case No. TV1055444. Upon WELCHโS departure from the jail SBSD\n8\npersonnel subjected her to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. The search occurred in\n9\na jail hallway with other female inmates present, without privacy afforded to the inmates.\n10\nWELCH and the women were searched even though the deputies did not have reasonable\n11\nsuspicion that the women were in possession of contraband or weapons. \n12\n43. When WELCH appeared before the superior court on July 25, 2005, the court\n13\nplaced WELCH on probation and ordered her released from custody. For purposes of\n14\nprocessing plaintiffโs release, San Bernardino Sheriffโs deputies took custody of her and\n15\nreturned her to West Valley Detention Center. Upon arrival, WELCH, along with other\n16\nwomen, was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. After the search, jail\n17\nofficials released WELCH from custody.\n18\n44. The strip and/or visual body cavity searches of plaintiff WELCH took place in\n19\na hallway off the sallyport (the entrance into the jail). She was always searched as part of\n20\na group of female inmates, ranging from about seven to 30 or more. While facing the\n21\ndeputies, plaintiff and the other inmates had to remove all their clothing, including their bras\n22\nand panties, and shake them out.  Pursuant to the deputiesโ commands, WELCH and the\n23\nothers turned, faced the wall, bent over, spread their buttocks, put a finger inside their\n24\nvaginas, squat, spread the lips of their vaginas, and coughed. The deputies forced the\n25\n26 inmates to squat for a painful amount of time. Plaintiff WELCH and the others were forced\n27 to stand, naked, so close to one another that they were touching.\n28 45. During one of the searches, as the inmates were squatting and coughing, the\n-10-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 deputies stated that some of the women did not cough correctly. The deputies ordered all\n2 the women to remain in the crouched position, holding their buttocks and vaginal lips apart\n3 for over a minute, and continuing to cough. WELCH has steel rods and plates in both of her\n4 legs and, consequently, suffered considerable pain trying to keep her balance.  If female\n5 inmates were menstruating, they had to remove their tampons and pads.  Some women\n6\nbegan to menstruate on the floor.  If they did not spread their legs far enough apart the\n7\ndeputies would kick their ankles to make them spread farther.  Although only two female\n8\ndeputies conducted the search, there were other deputies present who were not involved\n9\nin the search. Also present were trustees who handed out pads and cleaned up the blood\n10\non the floor.\n11\n46. There was a large window in the hallway where the searches were conducted.\n12\nFrom the other side of the window, male deputies and male inmates being brought into the\n13\njail could view the searches of the female inmates. The searches of the female inmates were\n14\nalso visible to female inmates in the holding cells.\n15\n47. During the searches, the deputies treated the whole affair as a joke laughing and\n16\ncalling WELCH and others โstinky bitches.โ Once, an inmate was too incoherent to lift her\n17\nbreasts as ordered. So a deputy ridiculed her, saying that if she couldnโt lift her own breasts\n18\nthen the woman next to her was going to have to lift them.  \n19\n48. On one occasion, there were pregnant women who were strip searched with\n20\nWELCH (the women were returning from a hospital run). One woman appeared about eight\n21\nmonths pregnant.  After she had opened and touched her vagina as demanded by the\n22\ndeputy, the deputy mockingly stated โlet me see that again.โ  The deputy even made the\n23\npregnant women squat and cough. Plaintiff WELCH was worried that the pregnant woman\n24\nwould go into labor as it appeared she was having a very difficult time squatting and\n25\n26 coughing for so long.\n27 CLAIM OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAMS.\n28 49. On or about May 6, 2004, plaintiff WILLIAMS was arrested on a bench warrant\n-11-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 for a failure to appear in a criminal case in which it was alleged that on February 28, 2004,\n2 WILLIAMS violated Cal. Health & Safety Code ยง 11550(a). Section 11550(a) makes it a\n3 misdemeanor to be under the influence of a controlled substance.\n4 50. Upon WILLIAMSโ arrest she was booked into the West Valley Detention\n5 Center. Upon processing into the jail, she was subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n6\nsearch with other women in a hallway without privacy and in the presence and view of\n7\nother inmates and visible to Sheriffโs personnel not involved in or necessary to the search.\n8\nWILLIAMS  and  the  women  were  searched  even  though  the  deputies  did  not  have\n9\nreasonable suspicion that the women were in possession of contraband or weapons.\n10\n51. On or about May 7, 2004, SBSD personnel transported WILLIAMS from West\n11\nValley Detention Center to the San Bernardino Superior Court for arraignment on the\n12\nwarrant in case no. FSB048197. Both upon her departure and return to the jail after\n13\narraignment, SBSD personnel subjected WILLIAMS to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n14\nsearch as described above. WILLIAMS was searched even though the deputies did not\n15\nhave reasonable suspicion that plaintiff was in possession of contraband or weapons. \n16\n52. On or about June 10, 2004, plaintiff WILLIAMS was again arrested on a bench\n17\nwarrant for a failure to appear in the above criminal case. Upon her arrest she was booked\n18\ninto the West Valley Detention Center where, upon arrival, she was subjected to a strip\n19\nand/or body cavity search as described above. WILLIAMS was searched even though the\n20\ndeputies did not have reasonable suspicion that plaintiff was in possession of contraband\n21\nor weapons. \n22\n53. On or about June 11, 2004, SBSD personnel transported WILLIAMS from West\n23\nValley Detention Center to the San Bernardino Superior Court for arraignment on the\n24\nwarrant. Both upon her departure and return to the jail from the courthouse, SBSD\n25\n26 personnel subjected WILLIAMS to a strip and/or visual body cavity search in a jail hallway\n27 with other female inmates present, with no privacy afforded to the inmates.  WILLIAMS\n28 was searched even though the deputies did not have reasonable suspicion that plaintiff was\n-12-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 in possession of contraband or weapons.\n2 54. Plaintiff WILLIAMS remained in SBSD custody, at the West Valley Detention\n3 Center, until June 30, 2004. On that date SBSD personnel transported WILLIAMS from\n4 West Valley Detention Center to the San Bernardino Superior Court. Upon WILLIAMSโ\n5 departure SBSD personnel searched WILLIAMS as described above, i.e., a strip and/or\n6\nvisual body cavity search in a hallway, without privacy and in the presence of other\n7\ninmates. WILLIAMS was searched even though the deputies did not have reasonable\n8\nsuspicion that plaintiff was in possession of contraband or weapons.\n9\n55.  At  WILLIAMSโ  June  30,  2004  court  appearance,  the  court  ordered  that\n10\nWILLIAMS be released from custody. SBSD personnel returned her to the West Valley\n11\nDetention Center in order to process her release. Upon arrival, WILLIAMS was subjected\n12\nto an illegal strip and/or visual body cavity search, again in a jail hallway with other\n13\ninmates present, and without privacy. After searching WILLIAMS, jail officials released\n14\nher from custody.\n15\n56. On or about March 22, 2005, WILLIAMS, in SBSD custody at West Valley\n16\nDetention Center on a charge of violating Penal Code ยง 459 (burglary), was transported to\n17\nthe San Bernardino Superior Court, No. FSB048197. Upon her departure from the jail\n18\nWILLIAMS was subjected to an illegal strip and/or visual body cavity search in the jail\n19\nhallway with other inmates present, and without privacy. \n20\n57.  On or about July 8, 2005, WILLIAMS, in SBSD custody at West Valley\n21\nDetention Center on the aforementioned burglary charge, was transported to the San\n22\nBernardino Superior Court No. FSB048197. Upon her departure from the jail WILLIAMS\n23\nwas subjected to an strip and/or visual body cavity search in the jail hallway with other\n24\ninmates present, and without privacy. This process was repeated on or about August 2,\n25\n26 2005, when WILLIAMS, in SBSD custody at West Valley Detention Center on the\n27 aforementioned burglary charge, was transported to the San Bernardino Superior Court.\n28 58. Plaintiff WILLIAMSโ searches took place in a hallway off the sallyport.  She\n-13-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 was always searched as part of a group of female inmates, with no privacy. The deputies\n2 made WILLIAMS and the other remove all their clothing, and any tampons or sanitary\n3 napkins. While standing naked and facing the deputies, the women had to shake all their\n4 clothes, lift their breasts and stomachs.  At the deputiesโ commands, the women turned to\n5 face the wall and, with their backs to the deputies, squatted, spread their buttocks and\n6\ncoughed.  As the women were being searched, other deputies not involved in the search\n7\nwere also present. Additionally, at least one trustee was present during the search. There\n8\nwere windows in the hallway. Persons on the other side of the window could observe the\n9\nwomen as they were being searched.\n10\nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n11\n59. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of the class of all\n12\nother persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n13\n60. Plaintiffs propose five classes.\n14\n61. Class One is defined as persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of this\n15\naction, and up to the time that the practice ceases, or the time of judgment or settlement of\n16\nthe case: (1) were in SBSD custody; (2) were booked on a charge (whether misdemeanor\n17\nor felony) not involving possession of drugs or violence; (3) were strip and/or visual body\n18\ncavity searched before their arraignment absent reasonable suspicion or probable cause that\n19\nthe  individual  is  in  possession  of  weapons  or  drugs,  before  being  placed  in  a  San\n20\nBernardino County Jail facility.  All of the named plaintiffs belong to and represent Class\n21\nOne. Class One is made up of three subclasses of pre-arraignment arrestees:\n22\nA. The first subclass is defined as persons who were taken directly to\n23\nWest Valley Detention Center or Central Detention Center upon arrest.  Plaintiffs\n24\nCRAFT and WILLIAMS belong to and represent this subclass.\n25\n26 B. The second subclass is defined as persons who were taken to West\n27 Valley Detention Center or Central Detention Center from another San Bernardino\n28 County Jail facility before arraignment.  Plaintiffs FROST, WELCH and HARDY\n-14-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 belong to and represent this subclass.\n2 C. The third subclass is defined as persons who were taken to West Valley\n3 Detention Center or Central Detention Center from a non-San Bernardino County\n4 Jail facility, such as a federal prison or a different county jail.  Plaintiffs RYAN and\n5 SANCHEZ belong to and represent this subclass.\n6\n62. Class Two is defined as persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of this\n7\naction, and up to the time that the practice ceases, or the time of judgment or settlement of\n8\nthe case: (1) were in SBSD custody; (2) were taken from jail to court; (3) became entitled\n9\nto release after going to court; and (4) were strip and/or visual body cavity searched before\n10\nrelease.  Plaintiffs WELCH and WILLIAMS belong to and represent Class Two.\n11\n63. Class Three is defined as persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of\n12\nthis action, and up to the time that the practice ceases, or the time of judgment or settlement\n13\nof the case: (1) were in SBSD custody; (2) were subjected to a strip and/or visual body\n14\ncavity search in a manner that would be illegal for persons covered by Cal. Penal Code ยง\n15\n4030(b) in that the searches are conducted without affording the persons searched privacy\n16\nfrom others, including but not limited to, privacy from members of the opposite sex.  All\n17\nPlaintiffs belong to and represent Class Three.\n18\n64. Class Four is defined as persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of this\n19\naction, and up to the time that the practice ceases, or the time of judgment or settlement of\n20\nthe case: (1) were in SBSD custody; (2) were subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n21\nsearch in  an unreasonable and unconstitutional manner, including but not limited to any of\n22\nthe following: the conduct of such searches in the presence of  persons of the opposite sex,\n23\nthe conduct of such searches in an overly intrusive or aggressive or abusive manner, the\n24\nconduct of such searches in the presence of persons not necessary to the search, or the\n25\n26 conduct of such searches in an unhygienic manner.  All of the named plaintiffs belong to\n27 and represent Class Four.\n28 65. Class Five is defined as persons who, in the two years preceding the filing of this\n-15-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 action, and up to the time that the practice ceases, or the time of judgment or settlement of\n2 the case: (1) were in SBSD custody; (2) were transported from jail to court or another San\n3 Bernardino County jail; and (3) were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\n4 before transport.  Plaintiff WILLIAMS belongs to and represents Class Five.\n5 66. In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the aforementioned\n6\nclasses are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know\n7\nthe exact number of class members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege,\n8\nthat there are more than 50 inmates per day who are subjected to strip and/or visual body\n9\ncavity searches as a result of defendantsโ policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting\n10\nprisoners to strip and/or visual body cavity searches. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n11\nand thereon allege, that there are thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n12\n67. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of fact common\n13\nto the three classes. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the\n14\ncommon questions of fact include: (1) Whether the SBSD routinely subjects all prisoners\n15\nto strip and/or visual body cavity searches, without any reasonable suspicion based on\n16\nspecific  or  articulable  facts  to  believe  any  particular  inmate  has  concealed  drug(s),\n17\nweapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body cavities; and (2) Whether the strip and/or\n18\nvisual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the search cannot\n19\nbe observed by persons not participating in the search, or whether the strip and/or visual\n20\nbody cavity searches are conducted in open areas where they may be observed by persons\n21\nnot participating in the searches.\n22\n68. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of law common\n23\nto the three classes.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the common\n24\nquestions of law include but are not limited to: (1) Whether the SBSD may indiscriminately\n25\n26 conduct strip and/or visual body cavity searches of inmates without any reasonable\n27 suspicion based on specific or articulable facts to believe any particular inmate has\n28 concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body cavities; (2) Whether the\n-16-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 SBSD may conduct strip and/or visual body cavity searches of inmates in open areas where\n2 they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (3) Whether SBSDโs\n3 policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or visual body cavity searches violates California\n4 Penal Code ยง4030; (4) Whether SBSDโs policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or visual\n5 body cavity searches in an area which is not an โarea of privacyโ violates California Penal\n6\nCode ยง4030 (m); (5) Whether the conduct described above violates the Fourth Amendment;\n7\n(6) Whether the conduct described above constitutes a policy or custom of the defendants;\n8\n(7) Whether defendant PENROD, or any DOE defendants, are entitled to qualified\n9\nimmunity on the federal claims, or state law immunity on the state law claims, for the\n10\npractices complained of herein; and (8) Whether determination of damages suffered by a\n11\nstatistically representative sample of the class provides the basis for determination of all\n12\nclass membersโ damages except those who opt out.\n13\n69. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the representative\n14\nplaintiffs are typical of the class:\n15\nA. For Class One, each of the named plaintiffs were booked on a charge\n16\n(whether misdemeanor or felony) not involving possession of drugs or violence.\n17\nPlaintiffs were in SBSD custody when they were subjected to strip and/or visual\n18\nbody  cavity  searches  without  any  reasonable  suspicion  based  on  specific  or\n19\narticulable facts to believe that plaintiffs had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or\n20\nany contraband in their body cavities, before being placed in a San Bernardino\n21\nCounty jail.\n22\nB. For Class Two, plaintiffs WELCH and WILLIAMS were taken from jail\n23\nto court, became entitled to release after going to court, and were strip and/or visual\n24\nbody cavity searched before release.\n25\n26 C. For Class Three, each of the named plaintiffs were subjected to strip and/or\n27 visual body cavity searches without privacy and under conditions that would violate\n28 Cal. Penal Code ยง 4030 were it applicable to persons like plaintiffs.\n-17-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 D. For Class Four, each of the named plaintiffs were subjected to a strip\n2 and/or  visual  body  cavity  search  in  an  unreasonable,  and  accordingly\n3 unconstitutional, manner including, but not limited to, any of the following: the\n4 conduct of such searches in the presence of  persons of the opposite sex; the conduct\n5 of such searches in an overly intrusive, or aggressive, or abusive manner; the\n6\nconduct of such searches in the presence of persons not necessary to the search, or\n7\nthe conduct of such searches in an unhygienic manner.\n8\nE. For Class Five, plaintiff WILLIAMS was transported from jail to court or\n9\nanother jail, and strip and/or visual body cavity searched prior to transport.\n10\n70. Each of the named plaintiffโs claims is based upon the same legal theories as the\n11\nclaims of the class members they represent. Each class member suffered actual damages\n12\nas a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. The actual\n13\ndamages suffered by the representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the\n14\nactual damages suffered by each class member.\n15\n71. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative parties will fairly\n16\nand adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the representative plaintiffs\n17\nare consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n18\n72. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of separate\n19\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n20\nadjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible\n21\nstandards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n22\n73. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate\n23\nactions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with respect\n24\nto individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair\n25\n26 or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n27 74. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are informed and\n28 believe and thereon allege that the defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable\n-18-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with\n2 respect to the class as a whole.\n3 75. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is superior to\n4 other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between\n5 the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the interest of\n6\nmembers of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low,\n7\nin that most class members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all.\n8\nPlaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the amounts at stake for\n9\nindividuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed\n10\nand believe, and thereon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find\n11\ncounsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that it\n12\nis desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the\n13\nsame location, i.e., the County of San Bernardino.  It will promote judicial efficiency to\n14\nresolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.\n15\n76. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiffs are informed\n16\nand believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained\n17\nfrom SBSD records. Class plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that\n18\nSBSD records reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the\n19\npersons who have been held in custody by SBSD.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n20\nthereon allege, that SBSD records reflect when prisoners were taken to court, when\n21\nprisoners are returned from court, why prisoners were released, and when prisoners were\n22\nreleased.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that all of the foregoing information is\n23\ncontained in SBSDโs computer system, the โJail Information Management System,โ\n24\ncommonly referred as โJIMSโ, and that the information necessary to identify the class\n25\n26 members, their last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their releases from\n27 custody, is readily available from SBSDโs computer system.\n28 77. Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of\n-19-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.  The class action is\n2 superior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised in this action.  The class\n3 action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist from which to\n4 ascertain the members of the putative class. Liability can be determined on a class-wide\n5 basis. Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set by a\n6\njury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and\n7\nextrapolating those damages to the class as a whole.\n8\n78. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be furnished\n9\nwith the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all\n10\nmembers who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n11\nbelieve that SBSD computer records contain a last known address for class members.\n12\nPlaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be given to class members at such last known\n13\naddress by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class members of\n14\nthe following:\n15\nA. The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class;\n16\nB.The nature of the action;\n17\nC.Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which event they\n18\nwill not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n19\nD.Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own counsel\n20\nand enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented by the\n21\nnamed Plaintiffs and their counsel; and\n22\nE.Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor of the\n23\nclass, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues, adverse\n24\nto the class.\n25\n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n-20-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 COUNT ONE - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n2 (Against All Defendants)\n3 79.

In subjecting plaintiffs and the class to unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous\n6\nintrusive strip and/or visual body cavity searches, defendants, and each of them, violated\n7\nthe rights of plaintiffs and class members to be secure in their person against unreasonable\n8\nsearches and seizures, to due process and the equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed\n9\nby the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

In subjecting plaintiffs and the class to unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous\n13\nintrusive strip and/or visual body cavity searches, defendants, and each of them, deprived\n14\nplaintiffs and the class members of their constitutional rights to be free from cruel and\n15\nunusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n16\nand state law, thereby entitling them to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42\n17\nU.S.C. ยง1983.\n18\n82.

The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and/or visual body\n25\n26 cavity searches deprived plaintiffs and the class they represent, via coercion, of the\n27 protections afforded by provisions of federal constitutional and state constitutional and\n28 statutory law, including but not limited to rights protected under the Fourth, Eighth and\n-21-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article I, ยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, of\n2 the California Constitution, and California Penal Code ยง 4030.  Therefore, plaintiffs and\n3 the class members they represent are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant\n4 to Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1(b).\n5 85. As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, plaintiffs and class\n6\nmembers were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event not less than\n7\n$4000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง52.1(b).\n8\nCOUNT THREE -- Violation of Penal Code ยง 4030\n9\n(Against All Defendants)\n10\n86.

The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and visual body\n13\ncavity searches, to which the plaintiffs and classes they represent were subjected by the\n14\ndefendants, and the manner in which they were conducted, violated the right of plaintiffs\n15\nand the class they represent not to be subjected to invasion of their fundamental privacy\n16\ninterests, as guaranteed by California Penal Code ยง 4030.\n17\n88. Although by its terms Penal Code ยง 4030 only applies to misdemeanor arrests,\n18\nthere is no rational basis to establish different standards for how a strip is conducted in\n19\norder to maintain the arresteeโs privacy while allowing the strip search based on whether\n20\narrestee is charged with a misdemeanor or a felony. Accordingly, equal protection and due\n21\nprocess of law under the Federal and California Constitutions require that the manner of\n22\nstrip search protections contained in Penal Code ยง 4030 apply to felony arrestees as well\n23\nas misdemeanor arrestees.\n24\n89. The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused the\n25\n26 plaintiffs and the classes they represent to be deprived of their rights as stated above,\n27 thereby entitling plaintiffs and the class to recover damages proximately caused by\n28 defendantsโ wrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal Code ยง4030.\n-22-\n00011549.WPD\n\n1 COUNT FOUR โ Violation of Mandatory Duties\n2 (Against All Defendants)\n3 90.

As set forth more fully below, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs' Motion\nfor Partial Summary Judgment, for the reasons and in the manner stated.\nI. The Present Motion\nPlaintiffs seek partial summary judgment as to parts of their first cause of action (a claim brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983) and their second cause of action (a claim brought pursuant to Cal. Civ.Code ยง 52.1(b)).\nSpecifically, plaintiffs' Motion seeks adjudication on the following issues:\n(1) SBSD's policy of subjecting the following individuals to strip and/or visual body cavity searches pursuant to a\nblanket policy and absent reasonable suspicion violates (a) the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution, (b) Article 1, ยง 1 of the California Constitution (right to privacy), and (c) Article 1, ยง 13 of the\nCalifornia Constitution (right to be free from unreasonable searches): Arrestees returning from court who are\n[1]\nentitled to release as a result of their court appearance.\n(2) SBSD's policy of subjecting the following individuals to strip and/or visual body cavity searches pursuant to a\nblanket policy and absent reasonable suspicion violates (a) the Fourth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution, (b) Article 1, ยง 1 of the California Constitution (right to privacy), and (c) Article 1, ยง 13 of the\nCalifornia Constitution (right to be free from unreasonable searches): Arrestees who are transferred from a Type\n1 facility to a Type 2 facility, who have not been arraigned, and who are charged with crimes that involve neither\n[2]\ndrugs nor violence.  The Court will refer to these individuals as \"transferees.\"\n\nII. Uncontroverted Facts\nSan Bernardino County operates its own county jails under the auspices of the San Bernardino County Sheriffs\nDepartment (\"SBSD\"). The San Bernardino County jails are broadly classified as either \"Type 1\" or \"Type 2.\" A\n\"Type 1\" jail can only house prisoners for a few hours, extending no more than a day or so. A \"Type 2\" jail is one\n1174 that can book arrestees and house *1174 prisoners for extended periods, including for the term of a jail sentence.\nThe Sheriffs Department Manual provides a definition of a strip search as a thorough search of an\narrestee, by a departmental employees of the same sex . . . accomplished in a location restricted\nfrom the view of other persons not necessarily participating in the search, and accomplished by\nrequiring the arrestee to completely disrobe and submit to a visual examination of the arrestee's\nbody and a careful detailed physical examination of all clothing items prior to allowing the arrestee\nto redress. The visual examination shall consist of requiring the arrestee to open the mouth, raise\nthe arms, display the bottoms of the feet, and raise the breasts or testicles, when applicable, to\nguarantee that no item is secreted in these places. Additionally, the arrestee shall be required to\nbend forward at the waist and simultaneously spread the buttocks to allow the searching officer to\nview the openings of the anus and vagina to ensure that no protruding objects are present. When\nthe scalp is not reasonably visible, the arrestee shall be required to run fingers through the hair in\nsuch a manner as to dislodge any object secreted in the hair.\nSheriffs Department Manual ยง 3.1115.14 (attached as Ex. 3 to the Estuar Decl.). Pursuant to policy and practice,\nall arrestees who are returned to a jail facility from court are subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search,\nregardless of whether there is individualized suspicion to conduct the search. This policy and practice of strip\nand/or body cavity searches of individuals returning from court includes searches of arrestees who become\n[3]\nentitled to release as a result of their court appearance.\nSBSD's policy and practice is to strip and/or visual body cavity search all arrestees (including those booked on\nnon-violent, non-drug related charges) who are transferred from a Type 1 facility to a Type 2 facility prior to his or\nher arraignment. The search is conducted pursuant to a blanket policy, regardless of whether there is\nindividualized suspicion to conduct the strip and/or visual body cavity search on the arrestee.\nBefore being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, individuals are separated by gender. See\nBrown Depo. at 28, 33; Fonzi Depo. at 33, 36; Tanguay Depo. at 34-35. However, the individuals are not\nseparated from each other for the duration of the search; the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are\n[4]\nconducted in a group setting. See Brown Depo. at 29, Fonzi Depo. at 33, 37; Tanguay Depo. at 36.\nIII. Summary Judgment Standard\nSummary judgment is proper only where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,, and admissions\n1175 on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show *1175 that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthat the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see also Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).\nThe moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Whether a fact is\nmaterial is determined by looking to the governing substantive law; if the fact may affect the outcome, it is\nmaterial. Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.\nIf the moving party meets its initial burden, the \"adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials\nof the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this\nrule, must, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Mere\ndisagreement or the bald assertion that a genuine issue of material fact exists does not preclude the use of,\nsummary judgment. Harper v. Wallingford, 877 F.2d 728 (9th Cir.1989).\n\nThe Court construes all evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in favor of the non-moving party. \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505; Brookside Assocs. v. Rifkin, 49 F.3d 490, 492-93 (9th Cir.1995).\nIV. Fourth Amendment\nBoth sides understand that, in analyzing whether the searches at issue violate the Fourth Amendment, the Court\nmust apply the balancing test set forth in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979):\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. This test has been applied by the Ninth Circuit most recently in Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157 (9th\nCir.2006) (finding unconstitutional a strip search of an arrestee, performed pursuant to a blanket policy, where the\narrestee was arrested on a charges of being under the influence of a controlled substance), cert. denied,___\nU.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 665, 166 L.Ed.2d 513 (2006). Accordingly, the Court looks to the four factors of scope, place,\nmanner, and justification to determine if the uncontroverted facts establish the constitutional violations advanced\nby plaintiffs.\nAs to the scope of the intrusion, the Ninth Circuit has justifiably recognized that the strip and/or visual body cavity\n[5]\nsearch at issue in Way, and at issue here, is \"frightening[ly] invasi[ve]\" and \"humiliating.\"\nThe scope of the intrusion here is indisputably a frightening and humiliating invasion, even when\nconducted with all due courtesy. . . . Its intrusiveness cannot be overstated. . . . [T]he fact that a\nstrip search is conducted reasonably, without touching and outside the view of all persons other\n1176 than the party performing the search, does not negate the fact that a strip search is a significant \n*1176 intrusion on the person searched. . . . The feelings of humiliation and degradation\nassociated with forcibly exposing one's nude body to strangers for visual inspection is beyond\ndispute.\nId. at 1160 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The factor regarding the intrusiveness of the search\nstrongly favors plaintiffs.\nAs to the manner of the search, defendants argue, in conclusory fashion, that \"inmates . . . are not subjected to a\nsearch that is excessive, vindictive, harassing, or unrelated to any legitimate penological interest.\" Opp. at 9.\nHere, however, it is undisputed that the searches are conducted in a group setting, with the individuals separated\nonly by gender. Although defendants have presented evidence of some measures taken to preserve the privacy\nof those being searched, the evidence of record reveals that they have taken no steps to conduct the searches\non an individual basis and have instead continued to conduct the searches en masse without any attempt to limit\nthe humiliation occasioned by conducting the searches in full view of dozens of other individuals. In Way,\nalthough the Ninth Circuit ultimately found the blanket policy at issue to be unconstitutional, it looked favorably\nupon the fact that the search was conducted by one officer, with no one else present. Way, 445 F.3d at 1160-61; \ncf. Beard v. Whitmore Lake School Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 606 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that \"[t]he fact that the\nsearches of the females did not occur in the presence of only school officials, but rather in the presence of other\n[female] students, further supports the conclusion that the searches were unreasonable\"). Accordingly, the factor\nregarding the manner of the search also strongly favors plaintiffs.\nThe place of the search varies, not surprisingly, based on the facility in which the arrestees are taken. The\nuncontroverted evidence reveals that varying degrees of effort have been made in conducting the searches in\nplaces designed to provide some protection the arrestees' privacy. See supra n. 4. However, these meager\nattempts are vastly overshadowed by conducting the searches in a group setting.\n\nThe justification advanced by defendants is both predictable and legitimate: They are interested in maintaining\nsecurity in the jail facilities and in the other locations they take the arrestees. The Court is not unsympathetic to\ndefendants' attempt to ensure security within the jail facilities. As the Ninth Circuit has noted: \"We recognize the\ndifficulty of operating a detention facility safely, the seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contraband,\nand the deference we owe jail officials' exercise of judgment in adopting and executing policies necessary to\nmaintain institutional security.\" Way, 445 F.3d at 1161. Nevertheless, jail officials must structure their attempts to\nmaintain security with the clear dictates of the Constitution. See id. (\"However, this does not mean that a blanket\npolicy is constitutionally acceptable simply by virtue of jail officials' invocation of security concerns. . . . Rather, the\npolicy must be `reasonably related' to the [detention facility's] interest in maintaining security.\") (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted).\nAs to the arrestees who are entitled to release as a result of their court appearance, defendants argue that, if\nthey knew they would not be subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search upon their return to the facility,\nthey would have motivation to smuggle contraband in for the benefit of friends they wish to please (and/or\n1177 enemies they wish to appease). However, defendants offer no admissible *1177 evidence that supports this\n[6]\nargument.\nDefendants do not separately articulate a specific justification for the searches of the transferees upon transfer\nfrom a Type 1 to a Type 2 facility, but it is evident from the record that they are concerned with the opportunity\nsuch individuals may have to smuggle contraband into the Type 2 facility.\nA common theme runs through these two separate categories of arrestees: The concerns regarding these\narrestees' ability to smuggle contraband into the general population of a Type 2 facility.\nAt the outset, it is worth noting that the Ninth Circuit has clearly recognized that arrestees' intermingling with other\ndetained persons can impact upon whether a given strip and/or visual body cavity search is constitutionally\npermissible, but it cannot, by itself, provide justification for such a search:\nThe defendants seek to justify the strip search with the fact that [plaintiff] was being moved from\nthe holding area to a cell area on a different floor of the justice center. Several cases have\nrecognized imminent mingling with other inmates as a consideration in the decision whether to\nstrip search a detainee. However, the fact of intermingling alone has never been found to justify\nsuch a search without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there\nis any reasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons\nor other contraband into the institution.\nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir.1989),cert. denied sub nom., Frey v. Masters, 493 U.S. 977,\n110 S.Ct. 503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989),cited with approval in Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439,\n1447 (9th Cir.1989). As for the prearraignment transferees at issue in the present Motion, the only change in their\nstatus when they move from a Type 1 to a Type 2 facility is the potential that they will intermingle with the general\npopulation. Based on Thompson, this change in status is not enough in all cases to tip the scales in favor of the\nconstitutionality of a blanket strip search policy.\nMore importantly, for purposes of the present analysis, intermingling with the general population is not necessary.\nSee Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447 (noting that the \"fact that arrestee may ultimately be intermingled with general\njail population does not, by itself, justify strip search as such intermingling is 'both limited and avoidable'\")\n(quoting Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-\nDurgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.1999)). As is obvious from the record, the court returnees are\nreturned to their housing assignment temporarily for purposes of administrative convenience while their\npaperwork is processed and in order to collect any belongings they may have there. As became obvious based\n1178 on *1178 the arguments of counsel at the hearing on this matter, the transferees need not be transferred from a\nType 1 to a Type 2 facility prior to their arraignment; they are transferred merely to facilitate their efficient\ntransport to court appearances.\n\nDefendants also argue that strip and/or visual body searches of transferees have revealed contraband on the\ntransferees from Type 1 to Type 2 facilities. However, a review of that evidence reveals that only two such\ndiscoveries were made between April 8, 2005, and the present. See Simon Decl. ยถ 10 (a lighter found on a\ntransferee); Garcia Decl. ยถยถ 1006 (two baggies of white crystal substance that fieldtested positive for\n97\namphetamine found on a transferee). Moreover, the evidence does not reveal whether these two discoveries\nwere made pursuant to a search of a prearraignment transferee (such as the ones at issue in the present case),\nto say nothing of the fact that defendants make no attempt to demonstrate that any particular pre-arraignment\ntransferee had been identified as likely or potentially likely to smuggle contraband in a manner likely to be\ndetected by a strip and/or visual body search. See Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, No. C 03-01840 CRB,\n2006 WL 449148, at *6 (N.D.Cal., Feb.23, 2006) (\"It is not enough, as defendants would have it, for the\ngovernment to demonstrate that contraband smuggling is a significant problem. Instead, there must be some\nreasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify individuals as eligible for a strip search and the\ninterest in preventing the introduction of contraband.\") (citing Giles, 746 F.2d at 618).\nDefendants also suggest that they lack the resources to change their procedures. That may be so. However, it is\nevident from a review of the case law, the record before the Court, and the arguments presented by counsel, that\ndefendants also lack the will to change their procedures. The Court is not unsympathetic to a governmental\nentity's contention that it must operate within a budget; however, the Court is precluded from excusing\nnoncompliance with the Constitution on that basis. A lack of funds does not justify what is otherwise a\nconstitutional violation. See N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d 225, 234 (2d Cir.2004) (\"Arguably, it was more\nconvenient for the personnel at GDC to strip search S.C. upon her admission there, rather than determine\nwhether she had been strip searched upon her prior admission to NHJDC and had remained in custody\nthroughout the transfer process. Mere convenience, however, cannot be a sufficient interest to justify such a\nserious impairment of privacy\"); Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 392, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116\nL.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (\"[F]inancial constraints may not be used to justify the creation or perpetration of\nConstitutional violations.\"); Stone v. City and County of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 858 (9th Cir.1992) (\"The\nCity argues that it faces a financial crisis that prevents it from funding these programs, but federal courts have\nrepeatedly held that financial constraints do not allow states to deprive persons of their constitutional rights\"), \ncert. denied, 5:16 U.S. 1081, 113 S.Ct. 1050, 122 L.Ed.2d 358 (1993).\nIn essence, the justification offered by defendants is that of administrative convenience. Their procedures appear\nto move tens of thousands of inmates to and from court appearances in an efficient manner each year. However,\nthese procedures do nothing to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of the two categories of individuals identified\n[7]\nby plaintiffs in their Motion.  The justification factor strongly favors plaintiff.\n1179 *1179 Applying the Bell balancing test, therefore, the Court finds that the uncontroverted facts establish that the\nblanket policies at issue violate the Constitution when conducted on arrestees returning from court who are\nentitled to release as a result of their court appearance, and when conducted on pre-arraignment arrestees who\nare charged with crimes that do not involve violence or drugs. The intrusive nature of the search is beyond\ndispute, and the place and manner in which it is conducted does very little to protect the arrestees' privacy. The\njustification offered by defendants is essentially that of administrative convenience, and does not tip the scales in\nfavor of finding the blanket policies at issue constitutional.\nAs to the court returnees entitled to release, although defendants conduct the searches in order to maintain\ninstitutional security, they create the security concerns they seek to address by failing to segregate individuals\nentitled to release from those who are and/or who will be returned to the general population. This category of\nplaintiffs are, by definition, those who became entitled to release as a result of their court appearances. A blanket\npolicy of subjecting these individuals to strip and/or visual body cavity searches cannot be reconciled with the\nFourth Amendment. Cf. Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1986) (\"In most instances the\nunreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an [own recognizance] release determination is plain.\"), \ncert. denied sub nom.,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987).\nAs to the transferees, these are individuals who are transferred from a Type 1 facility to a Type 2 facility, who\nhave not been arraigned, and who are charged with crimes that involve neither drugs nor violence. Under clearly\n\nestablished law, absent reasonable suspicion, they may not be subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search\nupon their arrest. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 615 (\"We hold that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a\nstrip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing\ncontraband or suffering from a communicable disease.\"). Their transfer, and subsequent intermingling with the\ngeneral population of the Type 2 facility to which they are transferred, does not, absent reasonable suspicion,\njustify a strip and/or visual body cavity search where one was not justified previously. See Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n1447.\nAccordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment as to their first cause of action brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983, to the extent that claim is brought by Classes One and Two, and to the extent that the claim is\n[8]\nbrought based on plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.\nV. California Constitutional Claims\nPlaintiffs also seek partial summary judgment as to parts their second cause of action, brought pursuant to Cal\nCiv.Code ยง 52.1(b), which authorizes a civil cause of action by an individual whose federal or state constitutional\nrights are interfered with in a manner prohibited by Cal. Civ. Code 52.1(a). Section 52.1(a), in turn, prohibits\n\"threats, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or\nenjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights\" guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions.\n1180 *1180 Plaintiffs base their ยง 52.1(b) claim on their right to privacy guaranteed by Cal. Const. Art. 1, ยง 1, and their\nright to be free from unreasonable searches guaranteed by Call. Const. Art. 1 & 13. See Cal. Const. Art. 1, ยง 1\n(\"All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and\ndefending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety,\nhappiness, and privacy.\"); Cal. Const. Art. 1 ยง 13 (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be violated. . . . \").\nA. Right to Privacy Claim\nA violation of the California constitutional right to privacy gives consideration to three factors: (1) A legally\nprotected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances; (3) conduct by defendant\nconstituting a serious invasion of privacy. See Trujillo v. City of Ontario, 428 F.Supp.2d 1094, 1119\n(C.D.Cal.2006) (citing Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 7 Cal.4th 1, 39-40, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d\n633 (1994)). A defendant can prevail where he or she negates any one of these interests. Id. Defendants have\nnot argued that plaintiffs have failed to establish any of these elements, nor would such an argument prevail in\nlight of the analysis set forth above in connection with plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim. Additionally, however, a\ndefedant may prevail by showing justification. Id. (\"Defendants can prevail on a California Constitution privacy\nclaim by . . . establishing that the `invasion of privacy is justified because it substantivailing interests.'\") (quoting \nHill, 7 Cal.4th at 40, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633). For reasonas set forth above in connection with the\nFourth Amendment analysis, defendants cannot establish a countervailing interest that justifies invasion of\nprivacy.\nB. Right to Be Free from Unreasonable Searches Claim\nThe United States Constitution defines the minimum protection provided under Art. 1, ยง 13 of the California\nConstitution. See In re Lance W., 37 Cal.3d 873, 875, 210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744 (1985). Accordingly, for all\nthe reasons that the policies at issue violate the Fourth Amendment, they violate Art. 1, ยง 13 of the California\nConstitution.\nAccordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment as to their second cause of action brought pursuant Cal\nCiv. Code ยง 52.1(b), to the extent that the claim is brought based on plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights and the\n[9]\nrights guaranteed by Art. 1, ยง 1 and 13 of the California Constitution.\n\nVI. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and the\nCourt finds that, based on the uncontroverted facts, as to arrestees returning from court entitled to release, and\nas to transferees (as defines herein), the SBSD's blanket policies of conducting strip and/or visual body cavity\nsearches violates the Fourth Amendment, Article 1, ยง 1 of the California Constitution, and Article 1, ยง 13 of the\nCalifornia Constitution.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] Although it is not entirely clear from plaintiffs' papers, it appears to the Court that this category consists of\nmembers of Class Two, as defined by the Court's class certification order.\n[2] Although it is not entirely clear from plaintiffs' papers, it appears to the Court that this category consists of\nmembers of Class One, including the three subclasses, as defined by the Court's class certification order.\n[3] Defendants purport to dispute this, but the evidence to which they point establishes only that the release\nprocess, based on their existing procedures, takes some time to accomplish after the arrestee's return from court.\n[4] Although defendants do not controvert the fact that the searches take place in a group setting, they present\nevidence of some other measures taken to preserve the individual's privacy. At CDC, deputies not involved in the\nsearch can observe the search because of windows in the marshalling cell lead to an adjacent corridor. Brown\nDepo. at 30. At West Valley, males are searched in a transportation area with the door closed; a camera monitors\nthe search, but does not record it. Fonzi Depo. at 33-36. At Glen Helen, females are searched in a room with one\ndoor that is closed during the search. Tanguay Depo. at 35-36.\n[5] The search procedure at issue here does not differ in any material respect to that at issue in Way.445 F.3d at\n1159.\n[6] Specifically, defendants note that returnees entitled to release will \"logically have more motivation to smuggle\ncontraband than . . . pretrial detainees.\" The evidence to which they cite does not support such a position. The\ncommanding officer of the WVDC, Captain Fonzi, states the following in his declaration: \nA fresh or newly arrested person has fewer opportunities to plan and/or smuggle illegal contraband into a secure\nfacility. However, an arrestee who is already in custody and moving from one facility to another, whether it be a\nType One, Type Two, courthouse or hospital facility (i.e. transfers) will have a greater opportunity to plan and/or\nsmuggle contraband.\nId. ยถ 15. This statement is conclusory, it lacks foundation, it is speculative, and the declarant does not elaborate\nupon it. Therefore, plaintiffs' objection thereto is sustained.\n[7] Additionally, the procedures do not serve the interests of the individual deputies who perform the strip and/or\nvisual body cavity searches. These deputies may be held personally liable for damages00including punitive\n97\ndamages00for their role in these clearly established constitutional violations.\n97\n[8] The first cause of action is also based on plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment rights. See Third Amended Compl. ยถ\n81.\n[9] The section cause of action is also based on plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment rights, rights guaranteed by Article I,\nยง 7 and 17 of the California Constitution, and Cal.Penal Code ยง 4030.

This matter was heard on October 2, 2006.  As set \n19  forth more fully below, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs Motion and certifies four \n20  classes in this action, as well a number of sub-classes. \n21  I. Background \n22  The named plaintiffs in this action seek to represent thousands of individuals \n23  who were and are, while in the custody of the San Bernardino County Sheriffs \n24  Department (\"SBSD\") pursuant to SBSD's policies and/or practices, subjected to \n25  strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches upon their arrest, transfer \n26  between facilities, and transport to court appearances.  Plaintiffs also challenge the \n27  manner in which such searches were and are conducted. \n28 \n\nโข  โข ------------\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 2 of 10\n1  II. Class Action Requirements \n2  Plaintiffs seek to have classes and sub-classes certified pursuant to Rule \n3  23(a)(1 )-(4) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiff bears the \n4  burden of proof on class certification requirements.  Hanon v. Dataproducts Com., \n5  976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir.1992).  Prior to class certification, plaintiffs must first \n6  define an ascertainable and identifiable class.  Schwartz v. The Upper Deck Co., \n7  183 F.R.D. 672, 679 (S.D.CaI.1999).  Once an ascertainable and identifiable class \n8  has been defined, plaintiffs must show that they meet the four requirements of Rule \n9  23(a), and the two requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).  In re Beer Distribution Antitrust \n10  Litigation, 188 F.R.D. 557 (N.D.CaI.1999). \n11  In ruling on a motion for class certification, the Court is not required to \n12  determine the merits of any claim or defense.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 \n13  U.S. 156, 94S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974).  However, evaluation of many of \n14  the questions entering into determination of class action questions (including \n15  adequacy of representation)  is intimately involved with the merits of the claim. \n16  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay. 437 U.S. 463, 469 n. 12,98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d \n17  351 (1978). \n18  A.  Rule 23(a) Requirements \n19  Rule 23(a) establishes four prerequisites for every class action:  (1) The \n20  class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable (the \n21  numerosity requirement); (2) there must be questions of law or fact common to the \n22  class (the commonality requirement); (3) the claims or defenses of the \n23  representative parties must be typical of the claims or defenses of the class (the \n24  typicality requirement); and (4) the representative parties must fairly and adequately \n25  protect the interests of the class (the adequacy of representation requirement). \n26  General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 102 S.Ct. \n27  2364,72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)-(4). \n28 \n2 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 3 of 10\n1  1.  Numerosity \n2  \"The numerosity requirement requires examination of the specific facts of \n3  each case and imposes no absolute limitations.\"  General Tel. Co. of the Northwest. \n4  Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S. Ct. \n5  1698,1706 (1980).  The Ninth Circuit has affirmed district court rulings finding the \n6  numerosity requirement had been satisfied where there were only 27 members of \n7  the proposed class.  See Tietz v. Bowen, 695 F. Supp. 441 (N.D. Cal. 1987), affd \n8  without op., 892 F.3d 1046 (9th Cir. 1990). \n9  Here, the Court easily concludes that the numerosity requirements are met. \n10  This action involves claims based on the practices at two SBSD facilities.  By the \n11  SBSD's own account, as posted on its web site, one of the facilities, West Valley \n12  Detention Center (\"West Valley\") takes in approximately 50,000 individuals per \n13  year.  The other facility, Central Detention Center (\"CDC\"), takes in approximately \n14  15,000 individuals per year.  According to plaintiffs theory of the case, the inmates \n15  at these facilities are subjected to strip searches pursuant to blanket policy, \n16  practice, or custom.  The Court is satisfied that, among those tens of thousands of \n17  inmates, a sufficient number of class members exist to satisfy the numerosity \n18  requirement.  This is so even taking into account that the plaintiffs' Motion seeks \n19  certification of a number of classes. \n20  2.  Commonality and Typicality \n21  The commonality and typicality requirements overlap and are therefore \n22  considered together.  The commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named \n23  plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the \n24  prospective class.  Baby Neal for and by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. \n25  1994). \n26  The typicality requirement of Rule 23(a) is met if \"the claims or defenses of \n27  the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" Fed. R. \n28  Civ. P. 23(a)(3). This is a permissive standard, and \"representative claims are \n3 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 4 of 10\n1  'typical' if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; \n2  they need not be substantially identical.\"  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, \n3  1020 (9th Cir.1998).  To satisfy the typicality requirement, \"a class representative \n4  must be part of the class and 'possess the same interest and suffer the same injury' \n5  as the class members.\" General Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 156,102 S.Ct. 2364. \n6  The typicality requirement is satisfied \"if each class member's claim arises \n7  from the same course of events that led to the claims of the representative parties \n8  and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant's \n9  liability.\"  In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litigation, 202 F.R.D. 12,21 \n10  (D.D.C.2001). \n11  Here, both the commonality and typicality requirements are satisfied. \n12  Plaintiff allege they suffered a common injury by virtue of their being subjected to \n13  the strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches, and they allege they were \n14  subjected to these searches pursuant to a blanket policy or practice of SBSD. \n15  Whether, and to what extent, such policies and/or practices are followed is a \n16  question of fact common to the class members.  Whether, and to what extent, such \n17  policies and/or practices are unlawful or unconstitutional, is a question of law \n18  common to the class members.  It is clear that the named plaintiffs allege that they \n19  were treated just like all the other inmates were treated, rendering their claims \n20  typical of those of the class members as a whole. \n21  3.  Adequacy of Representation \n22  To satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement, \"the representative \n23  parties [must] fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. \n24  P.23(a)(4).  Due process concerns require that absent class members be afforded \n25  adequate representation before they are subject to entry of a binding judgment. \n26  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020 (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 42-43, 61 S.Ct. \n27  115, 85 L.Ed. 22 (1940)). \n28  Determining adequacy of representation requires resolution of two questions: \n4 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 5 of 10\n1  (1) Do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with \n., \n2  other class members? And (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute \n3  the action vigorously on behalf of the class?  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. \n4  Alternatively, the Ninth Circuit has stated that the adequacy of representation \n5  requirement is met when the representatives fairly and adequately protect the \n6  interests of the class.  Local Joint Exec. Bd. of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. \n7  Las Vegas Sands. Inc., 244 F.3d 1152, 1162 (9th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. \n8  973, 122 S.C!. 395 (2001). Adequate representation depends on the qualifications \n9  of counsel, the absence of antagonism, a sharing of interests between \n10  representatives and absentees, and the unlikelihood that the suit is collusive. kl \n11  The essence of one of defendants' arguments that plaintiffs have failed to \n12  meet this factor may be fairly characterized as follows:  The named plaintiffs are not \n13  the type of individuals that are best suited to representing others.  Defendants point \n14  out that a number of the class representatives have used aliases and have been \n15  convicted of felonies and crimes such as burglary and forgery.  However, this would \n16  be the situation in any case in which jailor prison conditions are challenged.  Model \n17  citizens, such as those defendants suggest would be the only adequate class \n18  representatives, generally do not make up a large proportion of the jail population. \n19  Defendants also argue that some plaintiffs' accounts of their incarceration do \n20  not match up with defendants' records.  Although such facts, if decided against \n21  plaintiffs, could render them ineligible to represent a certain class or sub-class, the \n22  Court is satisfied, at this stage in the proceeding, that each class and sub-class has \n23  at least one named plaintiff who can adequately represent it, and whose account of \n24  his or her incarceration is not called into question by defendants. \n25  Plaintiffs have satisfied the Rule 23(a) requirements for class certification. \n26  B.  Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements \n27  Rule 23(b)(3) requires a finding by the court (1) that the questions of law or \n28  fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting \n5 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 6 of 10\n.,  1  only individual members, and (2) that a class action is superior to other available \n2  methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. \n3  Certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate ''whenever the actual \n4  interests of the parties can be served best by settling their differences in a single \n5  action.\"  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1022 (citation omitted).  Rule 23(b)(3) certification \n6  requires that common questions predominate over any questions affecting only \n7  individual members, and that class resolution be superior to other methods for the \n8  fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. ]Q. \n1.  Questions of Law or Fact Predominate \n9 \n10  The predominance of common questions of fact or law is satisfied by \n11  plaintiffs' showing of \"a common nucleus of operative facts.\" Siegel v. Chicken \n12  Delight. Inc., 271  F.Supp. 722, 726 (N.D. CaI.1967).  In order to determine \n13  predominance, the Court looks to whether the focus of the proposed class action \n14  will be on the words and conduct of the defendants rather than on the behavior of \n15  the individual class members.  Advocate Health Care v. Mylan \nSee~, \n16  Laboratories. Inc., 202 F.R.D. 12,29 (D. D.C. 2001): Iron Workers Local No. 17 Ins. \n17  Fund v. Philip Morris. Inc., 182 F.R.D. 523, 539-40 (N.D. Ohio 1998). \n18  This requirement is clearly met here.  The focus of this lawsuit is on the \n19   actions of the defendants: specifically, the main focus from a factual standpoint will \n20  be to ascertain what are the SBSD's policies and practices regarding strip search \n21  and/or visual body cavity searches.  The legality and constitutionality of those \n22  policies and practices, once ascertained, will be the predominate legal issues.  Any \n23  individual assessments will be subordinate issues, and will be most likely limited to \n24  whether and when plaintiffs were subjected to the policies and practices and what \n25  damages they suffered as a result. \n26  Defendants argued in their opposition, without elaboration, that \"after \n27  adjudication of the class-wide issues, plaintiffs must still introduce a great deal of \n28  individualized proof or argue a number of individualized legal points to establish \n6 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 7 of 10\n.,  1  most or all of the elements of their individual claims,\" and that therefore \"the claims \nare not suitable for class certification ....\"  Opp at 11.  When pressed on this point \n2 \nat oral argument, defendants were unable to provide further elaboration or to \n3 \nexplain how the \"individualized proof' and \"individualized legal pOints\" should \n4 \npersuade the Court why it should not find the predominance requirement satisfied. \n5 \nTherefore, the Court finds that the predominance requirement of 23(b)(3) \n6 \n7  has been satisfied. \n8  2.  Superiority of Class Action Mechanism \nPlaintiffs must also show that a class action is superior to other available \n9 \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  The superiority \n10 \n11  inquiry requires a determination of whether the objectives of the particular class \naction procedure will be achieved in the particular case.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1023 \n12 \n(citation omitted). \n13 \nRule 23(b)(3) sets forth a number of factors the Court should consider in \n14 \ndetermining whether a class action is superior to other available methods.  Those \n15 \nare:  (1) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the \n16 \nprosecution or defense of separate actions; (2) the extent and nature of any \n17 \nlitigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of \n18 \nthe class; (3) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the \n19 \nclaims in the particular forum; and (4) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the \n20 \nmanagement of a class action. \n21 \nAddressing the first factor, it is not likely that the interest of members of the \n22 \nclass in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions is high.  The \n23 \nclass members, all of whom have been arrested and incarcerated sometime in the \n24 \nlast three years, are not likely to have the means to prosecute individual actions. \n25 \nTo the extent some class members may have the will and the means to undertake \n26 \nsuch a task, the possibility that they may opt-out of the present action alleviates any \n27 \n28  concerns the Court may have on this issue. \n7 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 8 of 10\n1  The second factor also favors certification as there is no indication that any \n2  class members have instituted actions similar to the present one. \n3  The third factor clearly favors certification.  This action is against the County \n4  of San Bemardino, which is located in this district.  Because the plaintiffs were \n5  arrested, incarcerated, and appeared in court in this geographic area, it is likely that \n6  the vast majority of the class members reside in this geographic area as well.  The \n7  convenience of all parties favor concentration in this district.  This case is well-\n8  suited for class-action disposition, and all the parties are located nearby; therefore \n9  concentrating the litigation in this Court is desirable. \n10  The fourth factor also favors certification.  There are, of course, difficulties in \n11  management of all class actions, especially a class action that involves thousands \n12  - perhaps tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands - class members. \n13  However, the Court is persuaded that proper management of the present class will \n14  proceed relatively smoothly with the cooperation of counsel and parties on both \n15  sides.  The Court is particularly persuaded by plaintiffs' argument that defendants' \n16  database could be used to track the movement and addresses of potential class \n17  members. \n18  Plaintiffs have satisfied the Rule 23(b) requirements for class certification. \n19  III. Classes and Sub-Classes Certified \n20  Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court certifies the following \n21  classes and sub-classes: \n22  Class One (Pre-Arraignment Arrestees): \n23  Subject to further refinement pursuant to three sub-classes described below, \n24  all persons who, from May 3, 2003, to the time of judgment or settlement of the \n25  case (or to when the challenged practice ceases), (1) were in SBSD custody, \n26  (2) were booked on a charge (misdemeanor or felony) not involving drugs or \n27  violence, (3) were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search \n28  without reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that the individual was in \n8 \n\nโข \nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 9 of 10\n1  โข possession of weapons or drugs, (4) all pursuant to a blanket policy, practice and \n-\n2  custom of strip searching all arrestees upon admission to Type 2 facility. \n3  Class One, SubยทClass A:  Those individuals who were taken to West Valley \n4  or CDC upon arrest.  Class representatives: Karen Craft and Veronica Williams. \n5  Class One, SubยทClass B:  Those individuals who were transferred to West \nValley or CDC from another San Bernardino jail before arraignment.  Class \n6 \nRepresentative: Elroy Hardy.1 \n7 \n8  Class One, SubยทClass C:  Those individuals who were transferred to CDC \n9  from a jail other than those operated by San Bemardino.  Class Representatives: \nRosemary Ryan and Ranette Sanchez. \n10 \n11  Class Two (Court Returns Entitled to Release): \n12  All persons who, from May 3, 2003, to the time of judgment or settlement of \n13  the case (or to when the challenged practice ceases), (1) were in SBSD custody, \n14  (2) were taken from jail to court, (3) became entitled to release after going to court, \n15  and (4) were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search before \n16  release, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice and custom of strip searching court \n17  returns.  Class Representatives: Betty Welch and Veronica Williams. \n18  Class Three (Challenge to Manner in Which Searches are Conducted):2 \n19  All persons who, from May 3, 2003, to the time of judgment or settlement of \n20  the case (or to when the practice ceases), (1) were in SBSD custody, and who were \n21  (2) pursuant to a blanket policy, practice, or custom, (3) subjected to a strip search \n22 \n1 As argued by defendants, Georgina Frost and Betty Welch are not adequate \n23 \nepresentatives of a class of pre-arraignment detainees, as they were arrested for \nailure to appear and sentenced to time served and probation, respectively.  There is no \n24 \nvidence they were arraigned_ \n25 \nClass Three is a combination of plaintiffs' proposed classes Three and Four. \n2 \n26 \nhe distinction between those proposed classes was premised on a legal argument \nased on Cal. Penal Code ยง 4030(b), which places limits on strip searches and body \n27 \navity searches as applied to individuals \"arrested for infraction or misdemeanor \n28  ffenses.\"  kL  By combining these classes, the Court does not intend to preclude \nlaintiffs' claims based on this statute. \n9 \n\nโข \nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 86      Filed 10/11/2006     Page 10 of 10\n1  .. a nd/or a visual body cavity search in an unreasonable, unlawful, and/or \n2  unconstitutional manner, including being searched in the presence of persons of \n3  the opposite sex, being searched in an overly intrusive, aggressive, or abusive \n4  manner, being searched in the presence of persons not necessary to the search, \n5  and being searched in an unhygienic manner.  Class Representatives:  Karen Craft, \n6  Ranette Sanchez, Rosemary Ryan, Georgina Frost, Elroy Hardy, Betty Welch, and \n7  Veronica Williams. \n8  Class Four (Transports): \n9  All persons who, from May 3, 2003, to the time of judgment or settlement of \n10  the case (or to when the practice ceases), (1) were in SBSD custody, (2) were \n11  taken from jail to court or another jail, and pursuant to a blanket policy, practice and \n12  custom regarding all prisoners to be transported, (3) were subjected to a strip \n13  search and/or a visual body cavity search before transport.  Class Representatives: \n14  Karen Craft, Ranette Sanchez, Rosemary Ryan, Georgina Frost, Elroy Hardy, Betty \n15  Welch, and Veronica Williams. \n16  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n17  DATE:  10 -II - 6(\". \n~N \n18 \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 ",

The Court has previously certified Strip Search Classes under Fed. R. \n25  Civ. P. 23(b)(3). This is a class action, certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for \n26 \ndamages and monetary relief. Class members have a right to opt out of the \n27 \n3 \n28 \nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING CLASS SETTLEMENT \nCASE 1384 DOD 71757 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 4 of 77\n1  settlement. Based upon the stipulation of the parties, and agreement as to the \n2  circumstances when potential class members were routinely strip searched, the \n3  Court's original class certification has been refined into five certified classes, \n4  defined as follows: \nI \n5  6.  Pre-Arraignment Strip Search Class. San Bernardino County Jail \narrestees booked on offenses not involving weapons, violence or drugs who were \n6 \ntransferred from a local Type 1 jail (a Type 1 jail is a local detention facility used \n7 \nfor the detention of persons for not more than 96 hours excluding holidays after \n8 \nbooking) to a Type 2 jail (a Type 2 jail is a local detention facility used for the \n9 \ndetention of persons pending arraignment, during trial, and upon a sentence or \n10 \ncommitment) prior to arraignment and were, at the time of admission to the Type \n11 \n2 jail, SUbjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search without reasonable \n12 \nsuspicion or probable cause to believe they were in possession of weapons or \n13 \ndrugs, pursuant to a blanket policy, practice or custom of Defendants of strip \n14 \nsearching all such arrestees. The class period for this class is May 3, 2003 -\n15 \nDecember 11, 2006. \n16 \n17 \n18 \nThe class definitions herein supersede the definitions contained in the Court's \nI \n19  class certification order of October 11, 2006. These definitions are based on the \n20  classes found unlawful by the Court in its December 7,2006, summary judgment \norder, and partially based upon agreement between the parties based on an analysis \n21  of the strip search practices of the Defendants that, as a result of this litigation, to \n22  the best of their knowledge have stopped. They have been slightly expanded based \nupon negotiations between the parties. The original class definition adopted by the \n23  court encompassed all pre-arraignment arrestees, but the parties agree that, based \n24  on the discovery conducted in the case, not all pre-arraignment arrestees were \nroutinely strip searched. Similarly, some groups  such as the USM and Transport \n25  Strip Search Classes - were not necessarily encompassed by the original strip \n26  search class definition, but, based on the discovery conducted in the case, are \nincluded within the settlement's scope. \n27 \n4 \n28 \nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING CLASS SETTLEMENT \nrASE 1384 DOD 71757 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-O P     Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 5 of 77\n1  7.

The class period for this class is \n4  May 3,2003 - March 7,2007. \n11.  By virtue of this proposed Preliminary Approval Order, the parties \n5 \n6  submit, and the Court finds, that, to the extent the Court has not already so found, \nall the criteria of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(3) are met for all the classes being \n7 \nsettled herein. Specifically, the Court finds that all the criteria of Rule 23(a) are \n8 \nmet, to wit, 1) that the class( es) are so numerous that joinder of all members \n9 \nindividually is impracticable, 2) that there are questions oflaw or fact conUllon to \n10 \nthe class(es), 3) that Plaintiffs' claims are typical ofthe claims of class members, \nII \nand 4) that the person(s) representing the class( es) must be able fairly and \n12 \nadequately to protect the interests of all members of the class. The Court further \n13 \nfinds, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23(b )(3) that 1) the common factual and \n14 \nlegal issues predominate over any such issues that affect only individual class \n15 \nmembers, and 2) that a class action is superior to other available methods for the \n16 \nfair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The Court further concludes that \n17 \nnothing in the parties' settlement alters, and if anything reinforces, the prior \n18 \nconclusions it reached regarding the desirability of the class action mechanism as a \n19 \nmeans of resolving the claims in this case. \n20 \n12.  For purposes of settlement, the parties have identified from the \n21 \nCounty's records the members of each class and reached agreement regarding who \n22  belongs in each class for purposes of this settlement. Only persons who have been \n23  jointly identified by the parties through this process qualify as class members for \n24 \npurposes of this settlement. The process has entailed reaching agreement on the \n25 \ncomputer programming logic to be applied to the Defendants' data to determine \n26  who fits the class definitions. Anyone not so identified is not a member of the \n27 \n6 \n28 \nORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING CLASS SETTLEMENT \nCASE 1384 DOD 71757 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 7 of 77\nI  classes, and is only a member of the classes into which slhe has been placed \n2  through this computer analysis. If a person is not so identified, he or she has the \n3  right to pursue his or her own claim should slhe so choose. Such persons are not \n4  considered opt-outs, for they were never members of the classes certified herein. \n5  13.  Defendants' stipUlations are for purposes of settlement only, and if \n6  this Settlement is not finally approved or does not become effective for any \n7  reason, Defendants retain their right to contend that persons agreed on as class \n8  members for this settlement are not in fact class members. \n9  IV.

As part of this agreement, it is understood that the costs of \npreparing and publishing the Class and Settlement Notice shall be paid by \nDefendants as an advance from the Settlement Fund.  Within two weeks \nafter this Preliminary Approval Order is signed by the Court, the Defendants \nshall deposit or cause to be deposited into an account designated by the \nClass Administrator by wire an amount of same day available funds equal to \nthe amount requested by the Class Administrator to cover the costs of notice \nagreed to by the parties and/or ordered by the court (which amount is \n$345,000), and will provide additional funds to the Class Administrator as \nrequested, except that the total of said funds shall not exceed $870,000. \nPrior to entry of the Final Order of Approval of Settlement, the Class \nAdministrator will not accrue any costs for figuring points for Claimants or \n~1  7 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 23 of 77\nany other activities beyond the \"Notice Procedures\" and \"Claims \nProcessing\" described in Exhibit D.I.  Any such payments shall be credited \nagainst the approximately $25,500,000 Class Settlement. If the Court does \nnot enter the Final Order of Approval of Settlement, then all such funds paid \nto the Class Administrator, to the extent they are available after payment of \nall accrued class administration expenses, shall be returned to Defendants. \n2.  Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 3, within thirty (30) \ncalendar days of the Effective Date For Payment, but no earlier than January \n15,2008, the Defendants shall deposit or cause to be deposited into the \nSettlement Fund by wire an amount of same day available funds equal to \napproximately $25,500,000, less the amount already advanced under the \nterms of the immediately preceding paragraph, and less the amount awarded \nto Class Counsel as attorney's fees and costs, which sum of attorney fees \nand costs will be deposited by wire to the trust account afLitt, Estuar et al. \non the same date. \n3.  In the event that the settlement is approved by the District Court \nat the Fairness Hearing in a Final Order and Approval of Settlement, but the \nfunds are not to be immediately paid due to objection or appeal (see \ndetinition of \"Effective Date for Payment\"), the defendants will place the \nfunds in an interest bearing escrow account, and the interest accrued shall be \nadded to the Settlement Fund for the benefit ofthe Class in the event that the \nsettlement is finally approved. Should the settlement not be finally approved \nafter exhaustion of all appellate avenues, all such funds, including interest \nearned on them, shall be returned to the Defendants (except to the extent of \nany Class Administration costs). \n4.  The parties agree that the settlement amount includes all \nattorney fees and costs.  Plaintiffs intend to submit a petition for attorney \nfees and costs to the Court requesting 25% of the Class Fund as attorney \n11 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 24 of 77\nfees, plus costs.  Defendants take no position on the amount of the fees and \ncosts being requested by Class Counsel in Plaintiffs' petition for attorney \nfees and costs. \n5.  The portion of the Class Fund not used to pay attorney fees and \ncosts, and Class Administration Fees, shall be used for the compensation of \nthe Class Members who file timely, valid claims.  The Claims Administrator \nand Class Counsel will distribute this money according to the Allocation and \nDistribution Plan, set out in the Final Order and Approval of Settlement. \n6.  The County represents that to the best of its knowledge,  it  has \nprovided all the electronic data in its possession regarding class members \nnecessary to both identifY and contact class members. Within thirty (30) \ndays of the Court's grant of the Preliminary Approval of this settlement, the \nCounty shall provide, to the extent that such information has not already \nbeen provided, any such additional information in its possession. Such \ninformation shall be confidential, and may not be disclosed to anyone except \ncounsel of record, the Class Administrator, and designated representatives of \nthe Parties. \nCERTIFICATION OF CLASS ACTION \n7.  The Court has already certified all ofthe classes at issue in this \nSettlement Agreement, pursuant to noticed motion, and after opposition by \nthe Defendants, as an opt-out class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), and \nthereby also appointed the Plaintiffs' Counsel as Class Counsel. \n8.  The parties have agreed to stipulate to the identification of \nmembers of each class, based on the County's records, for purposes of this \nsettlement. Defendants' stipulations are for purposes of settlement only, and \nif this Settlement is not finally approved or does not become effective for \nany reason, Defendants retain their right to contend that persons agreed on as \nclass members for this settlement are not in fact class members. \no \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 25 of 77\n9.  The Strip Search Classes resolved herein are defined as they are \nin the Definitions section, above. These definitions supersede the definitions \ncontained in the Court's class certification order of October J 1, 2006. These \ndefinitions are partially based on the classes found unlawful by the Court in \nits December 7, 2006, summary judgment order, and partially based on \nagreement between the parties based on an analysis ofthe strip search \npractices of the Defendants that, as a result of this litigation, to the best of \ntheir knowledge have stopped. They have been slightly expanded based \nupon negotiations between the parties. The original class definition adopted \nby the court encompassed all pre-arraignment arrestees, but, based on the \ndiscovery conducted in the case, not all pre-arraignment arrestees were \nroutinely strip searched. Similarly, some groups  such as the USM and \nTransport Strip Search Classes  were not necessarily encompassed by the \noriginal strip search class definition, but, based on the discovery conducted \nin the case, are included within the settlement's scope. \n10.  Notwithstanding the class definitions contained herein, the \nparties have analyzed the County data and reached agreement regarding who \nbelongs in each class for purposes of this settlement. Only persons who have \nbeen jointly identified by the parties through this process qualify as class \nmembers for purposes of this settlement. This process has entailed reaching \nagreement on the computer programming logic to be applied to the \nDefendants' data to determine who fits the class definitions. Anyone not so \nidentified is not a member of the classes, and is only a member of the classes \ninto which slbe has been placed through this computer analysis. Any person \nnot so included is free to pursue whatever legal remedies may be available to \nhim or her, but s/he is not entitled to receive funds from this settlement. \nIn \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 26 of 77\nFUTURE PRACTICES REGARDING STRIP SEARCHES \nII.  As a result of this litigation, and partially on summary judgment \norders entered by the Court in the course of this litigation, Defendants have \ndiscontinued the following practices: \na.  Strip search those who meet the definition above ofPre \nArraignment Strip Searches. (See \"Pre-Arraignment Strip \nSearch Class\" Definition.) \nb.  Strip search those who meet the definition above of US Marshal \nStrip Searches. (See \"USM Strip Search Class\" Definition.) \nc.  Strip search those who meet the definition above of Transport \nStrip Searches. (See \"Transport Strip Search Class\" Definition.) \nd.  Strip search those who meet the definition above of Post \nRelease Strip Searches. (See \"Post-Release Strip Search Class\" \nDefinition. ) \ne.  Engage in group strip searches (i.e., from here on, those being \nstrip searched will be searched individually in a private area, \nwith only those necessary to the strip search present. (See \n\"Group Strip Search Class\" Definition.) \nCLASS NOTICE ISSUES \n12.  The Class Administrator will send by United States mail a copy \nof the Class Notice attached as Exhibit C to all prospective class members \nwho have been identified through the joints efforts of Plaintiffs and \nDefendants as class members. \n13.  The Class Administrator shall publish a summary Class Notice \nin newspapers and periodicals widely disseminated in San Bernardino \nCounty and on the internet, and by any other appropriate means of \ndistribution. Notice shall be as provided in the attached Exhibit D, including \n1 1 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 27 of 77\npublication in a newspaper list that includes the San Bernardino Newspaper \nGroup (the San Bernardino County Sun, Inland Valley  Bulletin and the \nDai~v \nRedlands  Facts) for broad market coverage, the Inland Valley News \nDai~)! \nfor African American coverage and La Prensa for Hispanic market \ncoverage. \n14.  Within one week of Preliminary Approval of the Settlement, \nDefendants shall post the Class and Settlement Notice on each Unit of each \nSan Bernardino County Jail. Each such facility shall have extra copies of the \nClaim Fonn, and shall make them available to any inmate upon request.  The \nNotice shall remain posted until the period for class members to return the \nClaim Fonn has expired. \n15.  The Class Administrator has submitted a Notice Plan, whose \ntenns are approved by this Settlement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit \nD and D.I to this Agreement. This Notice Plan is without prejudice to \nadditional steps being taken to insure adequate notice to the Class in the \nevent that Class Counsel and the Class Administrator consider it advisable. \nAny expenditure in excess of $50,000 beyond the amounts set forth in \nExhibit D.l shall require either approval of the Defendants or Court Order. \nADMINISTRATIVE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PLAINTIFFS AND \nHANDLING OF OPT OUTS \n16.  Plaintiffs, acting through Class Counsel and the Class \nAdministrator, shall have sole responsibility for distribution of the Class \nFund, in a manner approved by the Court. \n17.  Class Counsel agree to oversee the Class Distribution (the \nportion of the Class Fund to be distributed to individual e1ass members who \nfile claims), which will be distributed according to the point system \ndescribed in the Allocation and Distribution Plan, as set forth in the Final \nOrder and Approval of Settlement. \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGLโข-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 28 of 77\n18.  Each class member's points, as defined in the Allocation and \nDistribution Plan, shaH be based solely on the information obtained from the \nDefendants' records. The total points will be divided into the available \nfunds, so that a value per point will be determined. Each person will receive \nthe value of his or her points. \n19.  In the event that more than 75 class members opt out of the \nsettlement pursuant to the opt out provisions of the Final Order of Approval \nand Settlement, Defendants may opt out of this settlement. \n20.  In the event that anywhere between 1 and 75 class members opt \nout of the settlement, a reserve fund and a sub-reserve fund  from the Class \nFund composed of what the unspent portion of the County's Self-Insured \nRetention (\"SIR\") funds, shall be established, hereafter referred to as \n\"Reserve Fund,\" and \"Sub-Reserve Fund.\"  This Reserve Fund and Sub \nReserve Fund will be maintained by the Class Administrator in a separate \ninterest bearing account. The Sub-Reserve Fund shall be established in the \namount of $1 0,000 to be used for future defense attorney fees and costs. \nDefendants' counsel will present a statement of its fees and costs to the \nClass Administrator for payment upon approval by Class Counsel.  Class \nCounsel will not unreasonably withhold payment of Defendants' counsel's \nfuture fees and costs.  Upon the resolution of each opt out case, 50% of the \ncombined costs of defense and damages for that opt out case shall be paid to \nthe County by the Class Administrator upon presentation of a statement of \nthe funds incurred to resolve that opt out. (The other 50% will be paid by the \nCounty directly.) This proeess shall eontinue until the Reserve Fund is \nexhausted, or all opt outs are resolved. \n21.  If the settlement is not approved or otherwise does not occur, \nthe case proceeds to trial and judgment, and the plaintiffs are successful, \n. \nplaintiffs shall seek as awardable costs under any available legal theory class \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 29 of 77\nadministration funds incurred in the course of this settlement process, and \nany future or additional class administration funds incurred in connection \nwith the case (as well as any other costs the plaintiffs deem appropriate). \nSuch applications shall be made to the court even where the class \nadministration costs sought as awardable costs were paid by Defendants. \nThe Court shalI determine whether any such costs are awardable, and to \nwhat extent. The final judgment entered shall reflect the award, if any, of \nsuch class administration costs, in addition to any other appropriate amounts. \nDefendants shall receive a credit against that jUdgment for the amount of \nclass administration costs paid by defendants, whether the court awards them \nas costs or not. \n22.  If a new settlement is reached because this settlement does not \ngo through for any reason, that settlement will include a credit for the \namounts paid by the Defendants pursuant to  1 of the terms set forth herein \n~ \nunder the heading \"Primary Settlement Tenus.\" \n23.  If this settlement does not go through for any reason, a new \nsettlement is not reached, the case goes to trial, and Plaintiffs are not \nsuccessful in their prosecution of the case, defendants shall not seek \nreimbursement from Plaintiffs of class administration funds paid under this \nsettlement. \n24.  After the final resolution of all filed or negotiated opt outs, or, \nfor those opt outs who neither filed nor negotiated cases upon the passage of \na period of two years from the time of the opt out, any funds remaining in \nthe Reserve Fund shall revert to the Class Fund and shall be used as part of \nthe final distribution to class members. \n25.  There will be up to four rounds of distribution of the Class \nFund, as follows. \n14 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 30 of 77\na.  First Round ofD  istribution. The first round shall be sent at a \ndate set by the Court after final approval of the Settlement, and \nafter the time for appeals in the event of any objections runs. \nThis round will be sent to all class members who file timely, \nvalid class claims. \nh.  Second Round ofD  istribution. The second round will be sent \nnine months after the first round. [If there are no opt outs, the \nsecond round will include amounts designated as part of the \nReserve Fund.] \nc.  Third Round ofD  istribution. If there are opt outs, the third \nround cannot be sent until after two years from the last opt out \ndate, or after the final resolution of all opt outs, i.e., it cannot be \nsent until after a time that any funds remaining in the Reserve \nFund that revert to the Class Fund so revert. Alternatively, it \nmay be sent once all funds in the Reserve Fund have been \ndepleted without the final resolution of all opt outs. [If there are \nno opt outs, or if the terms set forth in this paragraph have been \nmet, the Third Round will be sent six months after the Second \nRound.] \nd.  Fourth Round ofD  istribution. If, after the Fourth Round of \nDistribution, there remain available funds, those funds shall be \na) awarded to Class Counsel as an additional fee, b) distributed \nto the Named Plaintiffs in proportion to the amounts initially \npaid to them. [Court to choose one] \n26.  Experience indicates that approximately J0 % of people who file \nclaims do not cash the checks sent to them for one reason or another. At the \ntime of the Second Round of Distribution, checks will be only sent to those \nwho cashed their First Round check; anyone not cashing his or her First \n?Q \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 31 of 77\nRound check shall forfeit his or her claim to call settlement funds. Checks \nsent out during the First Round of Distribution and not cashed within 90 \ndays shall  be voided (except that, before the subsequent round of \ndistribution, the Class Administrator may re-issue such checks if it has \nreason to believe that they will be cashed). Similarly, at the time of the Third \nRound of Distribution, checks will only be sent to those who cashed their \nSecond Round check, following the same procedure as described from the \nFirst to the Second Round. \n27.  For each Round of Distribution, the allocation system set forth \nin the Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall be used to detennine the \namounts due to each class member. To ensure that all class members receive \na meaningful amount of funds during each round of distribution, no \nqualifying class member shall be issued a check for less than $50 during any \nround of distribution, and the distribution fonnula used by the Class \nAdministrator shall be set such that, despite the amount any individual \nwould otherwise be allocated, the minimum amount of distribution shall be \n$50. If, during the Second or Third Rounds of Distribution, theTe are \ninsufficient funds to distribute $50 to each qualifying class member, then the \nclass members with the lowest points shall be eliminated until there are \nsufficient funds available to pay each remaining class member $50. \nRELEASES GIVEN HEREUNDER \n28.  Plaintiffs agree to the dismissal of the Third Amended \nComplaint with prejudice as part of the Final Order of Approval and \nSettlement in this case. The effect ofthat dismissal shall be to bar any and \nall claims that were asserted in this action, Craft et. ai, v. County orSan \nBernardino et at, Case No. EDCV05-0359 SGL, including the claims of any \nof the Named Plaintiffs, for all claims encompassed within the definition of \nthe classes contained in this Agreement (and correspondingly reflected in the \nl!i \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 32 of 77\nFinal Order of Approval and Settlement). The Final Order of Approval and \nSettlement shall include a release of all claims against Defendants, including \nthe employees, agents and insurers of Defendants, to the extent pelmissible \nby law, including a waiver of California Civil Code section 1542, which \nshall be entered by the Court.  The Named Plaintiffs and each Class Member \nwaive all rights or benefits which he or she now has or in the future may \nhave, arising from, alleged in, or pertaining to the claims that were or could \nhave been asserted in the Lawsuit, under the terms of California Civil Code \nsection 1542, which reads: \n\"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does \nnot know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of \nexecuting the release, which ifknown by him or her must have \nmaterially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\" \nNO ADMISSIONS \n29.  Nothing in this Stipulation of Settlement and Dismissal shall \nconstitute either an admission ofliability or an affirmation or \nacknowledgement of the validity of any claim or defense to any claim or \ncounterclaim arising from or relating to the Lawsuit Or arising from or \nrelating to any other proceedings that have taken place among the parties. \n30.  The plaintiffs allege in their Third Amended Complaint that the \nDepartment has engaged in a pattern and practice of unlawful strip \nsearching.  Defendants deny those allegations.  This Agreement, and any \nstipulation related to this settlement, do not operate as an admission of \nliability by the Defendants of Plaintiffs' allegations. \n31.  If the settlement is not finally approved by the Court, then this \nStipulation of Settlement and Dismissal, and all proceedings thereunder, \nshall be considered of no force or effect, except as expressly indicated \notherwise above. \n17 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 33 of 77\nSUCCESSORS \n32.  All of the tenus of this Stipulation of Settlement and Dismissal \nshall apply to, be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and of \ntheir respective heirs, agents, personal representatives, predecessors, \nsubsidiaries, successors, and assigns. \nEFFECTIVE DATE \n33.

The COUli has previously certified strip search classes in this case, \n10  initially in its Order of October 11, 2007, and subsequently as modified for this \n11  settlement in the Stipulated Order Granting Preliminary Approval to Class \n12  Settlement.  With regard to monetary relief, the class has been certified under Fed. \n13  R. Civ. P. 23(b )(3), and class members have a right to opt out of the monetary \n14  relief stage. The class definitions stated in the Stipulated Order Granting \n15  Preliminary Approval to Class Settlement are the operative definitions of the \n16  classes being settled herein. \n17  VI.  CLASS-WIDE PROSPECTIVE RELIEF \n18  11.  The Plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief regarding the strip search \n19  classes have, as a result of this litigation, been resolved by the cessation of the \n20  following practices: \na.

Strip search those who meet the definition above of US Marshal \n24 \nStrip Searches. (See \"USM Strip Search Class\" Definition.) \n25 \nc.

(See \"Transport Strip Search Class\" Definition.) \n27 \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-O P     Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 45 of 77\nI  d.  Strip search those who meet the definition above of Post-Release \n2  Strip Searches. (See \"Post-Release Strip Search Class\" \n3  Definition. ) \n4  e.  Engage in group strip searches. (From here on, those being strip \nsearched will be searched individually in a private area, with only \n5 \n6  those necessary to the strip search present). (See \"Group Strip \n7  Search Class\" Definition.) \n8  VII.  CLASS COUNSEL \n9  12.  The Court reaffirms the appointment of Barrett S. Litt, Paul J. Estuar, \nto  Robert F. Mann and Donald W. Cook as counsel for the Class Representatives and \n11  the Class (\"Class Counsel\"). \n12  VIII.  PAYMENT BY THE DEFENDANTS \n13  13.  As set forth in more detail in the Settlement Agreement, the \n14  Defendants agreed to pay a total of approximately $25,5000,000 in settlement of \n15  this Lawsuit. \n16  14.  Within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date for Payment, \n17  but no earlier than January 8, 2008, the Defendants shall deposit or cause to be \n18  deposited into the Settlement Fund by wire an amount of same day available funds \n19  equal to $25,500,000, less the amount already advanced to the Class Administrator \n20  under the terms of the Stipulated Order Granting Preliminary Approval to Class \n21  Settlement, and less the amount awarded to Class Counsel as attorneys' fees and \n22  costs, which sum of attorneys' fees and costs will be deposited by wire to the trust \n23  account of Litt, Estuar, et aJ. on the same date. \n24  IX.  NAMED PLAINTIFFS' DISTRIBUTION \n25  15.  The Court approves the Named Plaintiffs Distribution - a total of no \n26  more than $200,000 (exclusive offees and costs). The Court concludes that this \n27  award is justified because the Named Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a \n28 \n10 \nA1 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 46 of 77\n1  whole, justifying awards to them higher than those to the general class. In addition, \n2  the Named Plaintiffs' individualized damages claims, including special damages, \n3  are a factor in the determination of the sum they receive. Such determinations \n4  cannot reasonably be made for class members in general without unduly \n5  consuming funds for administrative costs that will otherwise be available for \n6  distribution to Class members. Any fees due Class Counsel for their representation \n7  ofthe Named Plaintiffs are encompassed within the Class Fund Attorneys' Fees \n8  referenced herein. \n9  X.  CLASS FUND ATTORNEYS' FEES \n10  16.  The parties agreed that the settlement amount shall include all \n11  attorneys' fees and costs, and that the Plaintiffs could seek up to 25% of the \n12  Settlement Funds of $  ,000 as attorneys' fees (exclusive of costs). The Court \n13  awards Class Counsel  % of the $  ,000 Settlement Funds as Class Fund \n14  Attorneys' Fees, to be allocated among the lawyers who worked on the case, by \n15  agreement between Class Counsel, as well as costs, disbursements, and expenses, \n16  with interest from the date of the deposit of the Settlement Funds at the same rate \n17  earned by the Class Fund. Class Fund Attorneys' Fees are exclusive of the costs of \n18  pursuing the lawsuit to resolution, the costs after settlement, and the payment of \n19  the costs of Class Administration. The Class Fund Attorneys' Fees come to a total \n20  of $_  _.  The costs awarded to date are $_, which include both costs to be \n21  reimbursed to counsel of $  and costs to be reimbursed to Rosenthal & Co. of \n22  $_. The handling of the immediate and subsequent payment of costs to the Class \n23  Administrator is addressed at ~ _  below. \n17.  The basis for the Court's award of attorneys' fees and costs is \n24 \n25  eontained in a separate order. To the extent there is any conflict between this Order \n26  and the separate fee and costs Order, the separate fee and costs Order controls. All \n27 \n28 \n1l \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-O P     Document 130      Filed 09/โข21/2 007     Page 47 of 77\n1  of the foregoing amounts are to be paid exclusively out of the Settlement Funds \n2  without additional contribution or payment by Defendants. \n3  XI.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n4  18.  The Court reaffirn1s the appointment of Rosenthal & Company as \n5  Class Administrator (hereby \"Rosenthal\"). The Court authorizes the payment, to be \n6  made immediately by the Defendants, of $_ to cover its expenses to date. When \n7  and if the class distribution goes forward (i.e., ifthere is no appeal or there is an \n8  appeal and the settlement is approved at the appellate level or abandoned), then \n9  Rosenthal will receive all the funds remaining after payment the award of Class \n10  Fund attorneys' fees and costs (which will be paid directly to Class Counsel, \nII  payable to the Litt, Estuar Client Trust Account). Rosenthal will distribute the \nJ2    funds to the Named Plaintiffs as directed by Class Counsel. It is authorized to use \n13  up to $_ in additional money for further costs of Class Administration without \n14  further order of court. All other funds provided to Rosenthal will be distributed to \n15  class members who filed timely class claims as discussed below. \n16  XII.  ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION FORMULA AND PLAN \n17  J 9.  The Settlement Fund shall be used to compensate the class member \n18  plaintiffs, for the administration and distribution of the fund, including the Class \n19  Administration costs, any costs awarded, the Named Plaintiffs' Distribution, and \n20  the Attorneys' Fees awarded, all addressed elsewhere in this Order. The remainder \n21  will be distributed to the Class Members who file claim forms according to the \n22  following fonnula: \na.  The first Pre-Arraignment, USM, or Transport Strip Search a class \n23 \nmember experienced shall be valued at five (5) points. \n24 \nb.  The first Post-Release Strip Search a class member experieneed \n25 \nshall be valued at five (5) points. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n12 \n45 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 48 of 77\n1  c.  The first Group Strip Search a class member experienced shall be \n2  valued at two (2) points. \n3  d.  For purposes of determining points, any an-est event (aka booking \n4  cycle) during which a class member receives points for any of a \nPre-Arraignment, USM, Transport or Post-Release Strip Search, no \n5 \n6  Group Strip Search points shall be awarded. \ne.  A class member may have a Pre-An-aignment, USM, or Transport \n7 \nStrip Search in the same an-est event as a Post-Release Strip \n8 \nSearch. \n9 \nf.  Any strip search for which points are available that does not fit into \n10 \nsections (a), (b), or (c) above shall be valued at one (1) point. \n11 \ng.  A class member may receive points only for the first three an-est \n12 \n]3  events (aka booking cycles) for which an award is available. \nh.  No class member may receive more than a total of 15 points. \n14 \nNo class member who files and qualifies for a claim will be paid \n15  1. \nless than at least $50, and the final distribution formula will be \n16 \nadjusted accordingly. \n17 \n20.  Plaintiffs shall use their best efforts to insure that distribution of the \n18 \n19  settlement amount will occur in such a way so that no residual amount of the \n20  Settlement Fund will remain following final distribution, the details of which are \n21  set forth in the following paragraphs. \n22  21.  Since there are  opt-outs, which total less than the 75 opt-outs over \nwhich Defendants had the right to withdraw from this settlement, more than one \n23 \n24  and less than 75 opt-outs, a reserve from the Class Fund composed of the unspent \n25  portion of the County's Self-Insured Retention (\"SIR\") funds ($  ,000), shall be \n26  established. This Reserve Fund will be maintained by the Class Administrator in a \n27  separate interest bearing account. Upon the resolution of each opt out case, 50% of \n28 \n13 \nAh \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 49 of 77\n1  the combined costs of defense and damages for that opt out case shall be paid to \n2  the County by the Class Administrator upon presentation of a statement of the \n3  funds incurred to resolve that opt out. (The other 50% will be paid by the County \n4  directly.) This process shall continue until the Reserve Fund is exhausted, or all opt \n5  outs are resolved. However, up to $10,000 of the Reserve Fund may be used to pay \n6  defense counsel fees for work performed in this case after the entry ofthis Order. \n7  22.  After the final resolution of all filed or negotiated opt-outs, or, for \n8  those opt-outs who neither filed nor negotiated cases upon the passage of a period \n9  of two years from the time of the opt -out, any funds remaining in the Reserve Fund \n10  shall revert to the Class Fund and shall be used as part of the final distribution to \n11  class members. \n12  23.  There will be up to four rounds of distribution of the Class Fund, as \n13  follows. \na.  First Round ofD  istribution. The first round shall be sent at a \n14 \ndate set by the Court after final approval of the Settlement, \n15 \nand after the time for appeals in the event of any objections \n16 \nruns. This round will be sent to all class members who file \n17 \nclass claims. \n18 \nb.  Second Round of Distribution. The second round will be sent \n19 \nnine months after the first round. [If there are no opt -outs, the \n20 \nsecond round will include amounts designated as part of the \n21 \nReserve Fund.] \n22 \nc.  Third Round ofD  istribution. If there are opt-outs, the third \n23 \nround cannot be sent until after two years from the last opt-out \n24 \ndate, or after the final resolution of all opt outs, i.e., it cannot \n25 \nbe sent until after a time that any funds remaining in the \n26 \nReserve Fund that revert to the Class Fund so revert. \n27 \n28 \n14 \nA'7 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-O P     Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 50 of 77\n1  Alternatively, it may be sent once all funds in the Reserve \n2  Fund have been depleted without the final resolution of all \n3  opt -outs. [If there are no opt -outs, or if the terms set forth in \n4  this paragraph have been met, the Third Round will be sent \n5  six months after the Second Round.] \n6  d.  Fourth Round ofD  istribution. It~ after the Third Round of \n7  Distribution, there remain available funds, those funds shall \nbe a) awarded to Class Counsel as an additional fee, b) \n8 \ndistributed to the Named Plaintiffs in propOliion to the \n9 \namounts initially paid to them. [Court to choose one] \n10 \n11  24.  Experience indicates that some percentage of people who file claims \n12  do not cash the checks sent to them for one reason or another. At the time of the \n13  Second Round of Distribution, checks will only be sent to those who cashed their \n14  First Round check; anyone not cashing his or her First Round check shall forfeit \nIS  his or her claim to call settlement funds. Checks issued during the First Round of \n16  Distribution shall have a void date 90 days after the issue date, and a stop order shall \n17  be placed with the bank for all uncashed checks 100 days after the issue date.  Before \n18  the subsequent round of distribution, the Class Administrator may re-issue such \n19  stopped checks if it has reason to believe that they will be cashed. Similarly, at the \n20  time of the Third Round of Distribution, checks will only be sent to those who \n21  cashed their Second Round check, following the same procedure as described from \nthe First to the Second Round. \n22 \n25.  For each Round of Distribution, the allocation system set forth in the \n23 \n24  Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall be used to determine the amounts \ndue to each class member. To ensure that all class members receive a meaningful \n25 \namount of funds during each round of distribution, no qualifying class member \n26 \nshall be issued a check for less than at least $50 during any round of distribution, \n27 \n28 \n15 \ndl< \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-O P     Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 51 of 77\n1  and the distribution formula used by the Class Administrator shall be set such that, \n2  despite the amount any individual would otherwise be allocated, the minimum \n3  amount of distribution shall be $50. If, during the Second or Third Rounds of \n4  Distribution, there are insufficient funds to distribute $50 to each qualifying class \n5  member, then the class members with the lowest points shall be eliminated until \n6  there are sufficient funds available to pay each remaining class member $50. \n7  26.  The Court approves the Allocation and Distribution Plan set forth \n8  herein, and directs the Class Administrator to distribute the Class Fund in the \n9  manner provided herein. \n10  27.  The Administrator shall scale the claims based upon the point system \n11  described above. The Administrator shall compute the number of points due to \n12  each Plaintiff, and divide each Plaintiffs number of points into the total number of \n13  points to determine each Plaintiffs proportionate share of the Class Distribution. \n14  Each individual shall receive the highest point category for which slhe qualifies. \n15  To limit the potential effect of multiple arrests and strip searches on the point \n16  calculation, no person may receive more thanl5 points under this Settlement. \n17  28.  Each Plaintiffs points are to be based exclusively upon information \n18  obtained from the Defendants' records. The total points will be divided into the \n19  available funds, so that a value per point is determined. Each Plaintiff will receive \n20  the value of his or her points, except no Plaintiff will receive less than $50. \n21  29.  As of_, the Class Administrator received a total of  claims after \n22  the January 14, 2008, deadline to file claims. The court will [will not] accept these \n.J \n23  claims. [Additional claims will be accepted until  [No additional claims will \n24  be accepted]. \n30.  Except for the deposit into the Settlement Funds required by this \n25 \n26  Order, the Defendants will have no further obligations or duties or liability \n27  whatsoever with respect to the Settlement Funds. \n28 \n16 \nJ.Q \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 52 of 77\n1  31.  At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, the Class Administrator \n2  and/or Class Counsel shall submit a report to the Court summarizing the payments \n3  made to the Class, and seeking any final administrative costs to be approved. \n4  32.

The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this settlement and \n11  its provisions, and over the claims administration and distribution of the funds. \n12  Disagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved aspects of this \n13  Order shall be subject to mediation before the mediator who has mediated this case \n14  to date. Ifmediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for \n15  resolution. \n16  35.  The Class Administrator shall distribute the funds within 90 days of \n17  either the last day to file a claim form, or the time that the settlement funds are \n18  deposited with the Class Administrator, whichever is later. The Class \n19  Administrator may have an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days upon \n20  the filing of a declaration with the court setting forth the additional time needed \n21  and the reasons therefore. The Class Administrator shall file a final report within \n22  60 days after the conclusion of the Distribution regarding the Class Distribution for \n23  which it is responsible under this Order. \n36.  The monetary relief provided for in the Settlement Agreement shall \n24 \n25  compensate for all alleged violations of rights and all claims by the plaintitT class \n26  members that were or could have been brought in this civil action under any theory \n27  ofliability for any claims related to allegedly unlawful strip searches within the \n28 \n17 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 53 of 77\nI  class definitions contained herein, except as to monetary damages for those class \n2  members who choose to opt out. \n3  37.  The Court hereby dismisses the Lawsuit on the merits, with prejudice, \n4  and without costs, with such dismissal subject only to compliance by the Parties \n5  with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement and this Final Order of \n6  Approval and Settlement. \n7  38.  Plaintiffs are hereby severally and permanently barred and enjoined, \n8  to the fullest extent permitted by law, from filing, commencing, instituting, \n9  maintaining, prosecuting or participating in a lawsuit or any other proceeding \n10  against the Defendants, including and the employees, entities, agents and insurers \nJ I  of Defendants, involving or based on any of the claims encompassed by this \n12  Settlement and Order, including specifically claims on behalf of any class member \n13  whose claims are covered by this Settlement and Order. \n14  39.  The Named and each Class Member waive all rights or benefits which \n15  he or she now has or in the future may have under the terms of California Civil \n16  Code section 1542 , arising from, alleged in, or pertaining to the claims that were \n17  or could have been asserted in the Lawsuit. Section 1542 reads: \nA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not \n18 \nknow or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \n19 \nrelease, which if known by him or  her must have materially affected his or \n20 \nher settlement with the debtor. \n21 \n40.  Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice of Class Counsel as to the \n22 \n23  legal andlor tax consequences of this settlement, the payment of any money by the \n24  Defendants or the distribution of the Settlement Funds. \n41.  Neither this Final Order of Approval and Settlement, the Settlement \n25 \n26  Agreement, nor any of its terms or the negotiations or papers related thereto shall \n27  constitute evidence or an admission by any Defendant that any acts of wrongdoing \n28 \n18 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 54 of 77\n1  have been committed, and they shall not be deemed to create any inference that \n2  there is any liability therefore.

Pursuant to Rule S4(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n9  Court finds that there is no just reason for delay and therefore directs entry of this \n10  Final Order of Approval and Settlement. Inasmuch as this disposes of all claims \n11  asserted in the Lawsuit, the Court further directs the Clerk to enter an order of \n12  dismissal pursuant to F.R.Civ.P Rule 41 (a)(1 )(2). \n13 \n14  DATED: ______  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT \n15 \nJUDGE \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n19 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 55 of 77\n1  cc: \n2 \nBarrett S.

Who Is A Member Of The Class? \nYou are a member of the class if you meet the class definition (summarized above and set forth fully in the \njudge's orders) and your claim can be verified from the records of the San Bernardino County Sheritfs Department. \nSan Bernardino County must have a record of your being in custody such that officials can identify you \nindividually by true name and other methods of identification and ascertain that you qualify as someone who is \na member of the class,  Such records are the sole and final way it is detennined who is a member of the class, \n3.  What Is The Purpose Of This Notice? \nYou have a right to know about a proposed Settlement of this class action lawsuit and about  all of your \noptions before the Court decides whether to give final approval to the Settlement.  Your rights may be affected \nby this lawsuit. \nThis infonnation is being sent to everyone who is or may be a member of the class based upon the last known \naddress  available  from  the  records  of the  San  Bernardino  County  Sheriffs  Department,  and  otherwise \npublicized to reach class members, \nThis Notice explains the lawsuit, the Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are obtained, who is eligible \nand how to file a claim, \nThe  Court in charge of the case is the United States District Court for the Central District of California, \nlocated  in  Riverside,  California,  The  case  is  known  as  Craft  v,  San  Bernardino  County,  et  aI.,  Case \nNo, EDCV05-0359 SGL  The people who brought the case are called Plaintiffs, and the people they sued are \ncalled Defendants, \n4.  Why Is This A Class Action? \nIn a class action, one or more persons, called the Class Representative(s), sue on behalf of a group of people \nwho have similar claims - the Class Members,  One court then resolves the issues for all Class Members, except \nfor those who exclude themselves from the class, \n5.  Why Is There A Settlement? \nThe Court has ruled that certain of the claims in this lawsuit are correct.  This is a decision that Defendants in \nthe case could appeal.  Some issues have not yet been resolved by the Court,  Instead of continuing, both sides \nhave agreed to a Settlement.  That way, both sides are able to avoid the risks and costs of a trial or appeal, the \ncase can be resolved immediately, and the benefits of the Settlement can be made immediately available to the \nClass Members,  The Class Representatives and their attorneys think that the proposed Settlement is fair to the \n2  Class Notice - Craft v, San Bernardino County \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 59 of 77\nClass Members and the parties in the case and think that the terms of the Settlement are a fair, reasonable and \nadequate resolution ofthis matter. \n6.  Arc There Lawyers Representing You? \nThe Court has approved lawyers (called \"Class Counsel\") to  collectively represent you.  You will not be \nasked to pay your own personal money for  the services of these attomeys and their associates  and staff in \nlitigating this  case and  negotiating this Settlement.  Instead,  the lawyers will  seek payment from  the fund \nobtained on behalf of the class, as is described further below.  Only Class Counsel may act on behalf of the \nclass.  However, that does not prevent you from hiring your own lawyer to advise you personally about your \nrights, options or obligations as a Class Member in this lawsuit.  If you want to be n.:presented by your own \nlawyer, you may hire one at your own expense. \n7.  What Does The Settlement Provide? \nThe Settlement provides for payment of a total of approximately $25,500,000.  From the $25,500,000, the \nfollowing awards will be made: \na)  An award of attomeys' fees, in an amount not to exceed 25% ofthe approximately $25,500,000 total. \nb)  Payment oflitigation costs and settlement administration fees. \ne)  Payment of a total not exceeding $200,000, a portion of which will be paid to each individual who \nwas a Named Plaintiff and Class Representative, and whose individual damages could be assessed \nprior  to  Settlement.  These plaintiffs  will  receive  more  under  the  Settlement than  other  Class \nMembers  because  of the  role  that  they played  in  the  litigation,  and  because  of individualized \ndamages detenninations made in their cases. \nd)  Payment of the remainder, estimated to be approximately in the range of $ I 7,000,000-$ 18,000,000, \nto the members ofthe class who file claims for payment. \nBecause this Settlement is to cover all possibilities, approximately $600,000 of the Settlement will be held \nback to cover possible County defense costs to defend against claims of people who may exclude themselves \nfrom the Settlement.  If there are no exclusions, or, if funds remain after the County's cost to defend against \nthem, they will be distributed to Class Members in a further distribution(s) after such issues are all over, but \nthese later rounds of distribution will be adjusted to the extent necessary so that only Class Members who would \nreceive $50 or more will receive payments. \nThe  Settlement also  states that the  San Bemardino County Jail no longer engages in the practices being \nsettled (i.e., except where there is reasonable suspicion to do so, will no longer strip search transferees before \narraignment, will no longer strip search federal  inmates at  the time of transfer, will no longer strip  search \ninmates being transferred from another jail to San Bernardino to face charges there, will no longer strip search \ncourt retums who are entitled to release, and will no longer strip search in groups). \n8.  Will I Receive Anything From The Settlement? \nIf it is verified that you are a Class Member, and you file an approved claim within the time set by the Court, \nyou will be entitled to receive compensation. \nThe amount you will receive if you do file a claim depends on a variety of factors, including which class you \nare in, and how many times this occurred to you.  However, each approved claim will receive no less than $50. \nThe  full  description  of the  proposed  system  to  determine  how  much  eacb  Class  Member  will  receive  is \n3  Class Notice - Craft v.

San Bernardino County Settlement Administrator \nP.O. Box 6142 \nNovato, CA  94948-6142 \nDeterminations of whether you are or are not a Class Member will be based exclusively on records of the San \nBernardino County Sheriffs Department. \n11. How Much Will The Lawyers Be Paid? \nThe Court has not yet decided how much Class Counsel will be paid.  However, they will ask the Court for an \naward of reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of 25% of the total $25,500,000.  The Court may award less \nthan that amount, but not more.  You will not be asked personally to pay any Attorneys'  Fees that the Court \nmay award to Class Counsel.  Only if you hire your own lawyer to represent you personally would you have to \npay that attorney any fees.  In addition, the amount of other expenses and costs incurred in pursuing this class \naction law suit will be paid from the Settlement.  These expenses and costs are separate from and not included \nin the amount of any attorneys' fees. \n12. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement? \nIf you do not want to be a member of the class, or if you want to be able to file your own lawsuit, or be part of \na different lawsuit against the Defendant raising the claims involved in this lawsuit, then you must take steps to \nget out of the class.  This is called \"excluding yourself' from, and sometimes is referred to as \"opting out\" of, \nthe class. \n13. What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The Lawsuit? \nTo exclude yourself, you must send a letter by First-Class mail clearly stating that you want to be excluded \nfrom Craft v. San Bernardino County.

If you are excluded, you will not be entitled to get \nany money from the Settlement, and you cannot object to the Settlement.  Nor will you be legally bound by \nanything that happens in this lawsuit. \nUnless you exclude yourself from the class, you remain in the class and give up all of your rights against the \nDefendants except those available to you under this Settlement.  That means that, if you don't exclude yourself \nand you also don't file a claim, you will receive no money but still lose your rights against the Defendants. \nSo be sure to file your claim. \nAnyone filing an approved claim is guaranteed to receive at least $50. \n14. What Is The Release Of Claims? \nAs part of the Settlement, you release the claims covered by this lawsuit in exchange for the money you are \nentitled to receive if you do not exclude yourself from the class.  The Proposed Final Order of Approval and \nSettlement (which you may view on the website for this lawsuit at www.SanBernardinoJailClassAction.com) \ndescribes the legal claims against the  Defendants you give up by staying in the class (that is, if you do not \nexclude yourself as described in the question above entitled \"What Do I Do To Exclude Myself From The \nLawsuit?\").  The Released Claims include all claims, demands, causes of action, whether class, individual or \notherwise in nature, damages whenever incurred, liabilities of any nature whatsoever, including costs, expenses, \npenalties and Attorneys' Fees, that were asserted in the complaint, specifically for the strip searches described \nearlier.  These  Released  Claims  include any  other related  complaints,  grievances,  and/or  claims,  whether \njudicial or administrative, and whether actually filed or available.  Released Claims do not include any other \nc1aim(s) that a Plaintiff or member of the classes may have against San Bernardino County for conduct not \ncovered by this Settlement, for example, a false arrest or battery by a police officer. \n15. If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneys' Fees, How Do I Tell The Court? \nIf you are and choose to remain a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you do not like any part \nof it, or you may object to the request for Attomeys' Fees.  You must give the reason why you think that the \nCouti should not approve the Settlement or the requested Attomeys' Fees (i.e., a mere statement that \"] object\" \nwill not be sufficient).  Do not contact the Court orally to object.  Rather, you must send a written statement \nwith the case name and number (Craji v. San Bernardino County, Case No. EDCV05-0359 SGL) at the top of \nthe page.  In addition, provide your name, your address Gust giving the address of an attorney who represents \nyou is not sufficient), your telephone number, the date of arrest to the extent known, your signature and the \nreason  why you  object.

San BernardInO Cot/nty \n,,~ \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 62 of 77\nA full set of the settlement documents, including the Proposed Final Order of Approval and Settlement and \nthe Motion For Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs either is available (or will be if the motion for attorneys' \nfees has not yet been filed) on the case website, www.SanBernardinoJaiIClassAction.com. \n16. What Is The Difference Between Objecting And Exclnding? \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the Settlement.  You can object \nonly if you stay in the class.  If you object and the Court rejects your objection, you remain a member of the \nclass and will be bound by any outcome of the case.  Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not \nwant to be part of the class.  If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer \naffects you. \n11. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement And Attorneys' Fees? \nThe Court has scheduled the Fairness Hearing for  10:00 A.M.  on February 4,  2008,  in tbe United States \nDistrict Courthouse for the Central District of California, Riverside Division, 3470 Twelfth Street, Riverside, \nCA  92501, in Judge Larson's Courtroom, Courtroom No. One.  At this Hearing, Judge Larson will consider \nwhether the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and will detennine the amount of Attorneys' Fees and \ncosts to be awarded.  If there are any objections, the Court will consider and rule on them.  We do not know \nhow long this process will take.  We do not know if the Hearing will be continued.  There will not be a new \nnotice if it is.  You may speak at the Hearing but only if you have submitted your comments or objections as \nprovided in the question above entitled \"If I Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneys' Fees, \nHow Do I Tell The Court?\" \n18. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? \nNo.  You may, but need not, attend the Hearing.  Class Counsel will answer any questions the Court may \nhave.  However, you may come if you choose, at your own expense.  If you sent a written objection, you do not \nhave to come to Court to talk about it.  As long as you properly submitted your written objection, the Court will \nconsider it.  You may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not necessary. \n19. May I Speak At The Hearing? \nYou will not be heard unless you have submitted your comments or objections as provided in the question \nabove entitled \"If! Do Not Like The Settlement Or Object To The Attorneys' Fees, How Do I Tell The Court?\" \nand have stated in your submission that you wish  be heard.  You  speak at the Hearing if you exclude \n(0  calUlO( \nyourself.  If you have submitted an objection, the Court will decide whether or not to hear from you verbally as well. \n20. What Happens If I Do Nothing At AI\\? \nIf you do nothing, your rights will be affected.  You will be bound by the tenns of the Settlement and you will \nbe agreeing to a release of the claims that are contained in the Settlement.  However, because you did not file a \nclaim, you will not be entitled to any money from the Settlement. \n21. When Will I Receive Money From the Settlement? \nNo money will be paid until 1) after the Settlement Funds are deposited with the Settlement Administrator, \nwhich will only occur 30 days after the Settlement is approved and all possibilities of appeal are completed, and \n2) until after the date set by the Court as the last day to mail or file a claim.  After that, it will take at least two \nmonths, and quite possibly more, to process all the claims, calculate the amount due to each Class Member and \nreceive the money to send to the Class Members.  If you file a claim and do not receive money within six \n6  Class Notice  Craft v.

You may want to send the Form in by \ncertified mail so it can be verified, but you are not required to do so. \n22. What Happens If There Is Not A Final Settlement? \nUnder certain circumstances, it is possible the settlement might not go through (for example, if there are too \nmany people who decide not to participate or if the court for some reason does not approve the settlement). In \nthat situation, the case would go forward and go to triaL If that occurred, it could be that San Bernardino might \nget a credit for certain expenses involved in the settlement out of a final judgment after triaL \n23.

You  may  go  to  the  website  titled \nwww.SanBernardinoJailClassAction.com to see the complete Settlement documents in the case, or a copy of the \nMotion for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs when it is filed.

Tn addition, our \nspecialists in Data Development, Printing/Mailing, Mail Processing, Address Searching, \nAccounting, Banking, and our entire Call Center staff will assist the Case Manager and \nCoordinator.  We will train the team in the details of the administration, claim forms processing \nand telephone support,  Telephone support training will include the development of questions \nand answers to be used as a guideline, and we will role-play handling calls before going \"live.\" \nNumber of Class Members: \nOur estimate assumes there are 165,000 class members.  We understand that this number might \nchange, and our costs will change accordingly. \nData and Forms Setup: \nWe will translate the class member list into our claims management software.  We will \nconsolidate records so that there is only one primary record for each class member and, as \nneeded, multiple records for each class member's bookings.  We will pre-assign unique \nsequential control numbers to each class member, and these control numbers will be used \nthroughout the administration procedure.  Prior to mailing, the addresses will be updated using \nthe National Change of Address System (\"NCOA\"), which updates the addresses for all people \nwho have moved during the past four years and who have t1led their change of address with the \npost office. \n61 \n\nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGโขL-OP      Document 130      Filed 09/2โข1/20 07     Page 66 of 77\nBarry Litt, Esq. \nJune 23, 2007 \nPage 2. \nWe assume that the Notice will be printed as a six page booklet, folded to 8 y,\"  x 11\" and then to \nletter size.  A second copy of the Notice will be translated to Spanish, and will be included in all \nof the Notice & Claim Form mailings.  The Claim Form will be printed on two sides of an 8 y,\" \nx 14\" sheet, with English language on one side and Spanish language on the reverse side. \nThe Claim Form will be pre-printed with the class members' names, addresses, pre-assigned \nclaim numbers, and barcodes ofthe claim numbers, as well as all the information that can be \nprovided upon which the claimants' shares are based. \nA # 10  size window envelope will be used, with the name and address on the claim form showing \nthrough the window as the mailing label.  A self-addressed #9 return envelope will be provided \nin the notice packet. \nAll proofs will be submitted for approval by the parties prior to printing. \nPrinting/Mailing the Notice and Claim Form: \nPrinting and mailing will be accomplished within one week after the final proofs are approved. \nThe mailing will be by first -class postage. \nWe will enter new addresses and re-mail all Notice/Claim Forms that are retumed by the postal \nservice with a forwarding address.  We will create a database of all returned mail without \nforwarding addresses so that we know which class members did not receive the notice. \nAddress Searches: \nWe will track all retumed undeliverable mail.  We will then conduct address searches using \ncredit bureau information for all returned mail that does not have a forwarding address, and re \nmail to the class members whose new addresses are found. \nPublished Notice: \nDANART Communications, our in-house advertising agency, has been developing media plans \nand placing space for legal notices since 1986.  The Summary Notice will be published in a \nnewspaper list that includes the San Bernardino Newspaper Group (the San Bernardino COl/llty \nSun, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin and the Redlands Daily Facts) for broad market coverage, the \nInland Valley News for African American coverage and La Prcnsa for Hispanic market \ncoverage.  We have budgeted for insertions on two weekdays and two Sundays in the San \nBemardino Newspaper Group, and for four weekdays each in the inland Valley News and La \nPrensa. \nAutomated Telephone Support: \nWe will establish a toll-free automated telephone response system.  The purpose ofthis system is \nto provide class members with access to information about the settlement (via menu-driven \nQ&As, if desired) and to capture Notice/Claim Form requests.  Callers will be able to request the \nti2 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 67 of 77\nBarry Lilt, Esq, \nJune 23, 2007 \nPage 3. \nNotice Packet by recording their name and address.  A Spanish Language version will be \nincluded. \nThe automated phone system vendor will transcribe the names and addresses of the people \nrequesting the Notice/Claim Form, and we will download thesc names and addresses once a \nweek.  Claim numbers will be assigned to all requestors, and the Claim Forms for the fulfillment \nwill be pre-printed with the name, address and claim number as they were for the initial mailing. \nWe will fulfill requests on a weekly basis, although beginning two weeks before the opt out and \nobjection deadlines, we will download and fulfill on a daily basis. \nWeb Site Set-up and Maintenance: \nWe will establish a web site to provide a summary of the case, the important dates, downloads of \nthe Notice and Claim Form, and access to Q&As about the settlement and any other documents \nthat are deemed important to provide the class. \nOpt Out Processing: \nWe will receive and maintain all Requests For Exclusion.  We will provide copies to the parties \nand the Court along with our Declaration of Notice Procedures. \nClaim Forms Processing: \nestimate assumes three levels of filed claims: 10%, 15% and 25% of the class members. \nOUf \nWhen the Claim FomlS are received from class members, they will be opened and sorted \naccording to categories that will be determined by the information on the fonn.  For example, the \ninitial sort might be \"no address changes,\" \"address changes,\" and \"no signatures.\" \nClaim Forms will be processed as received, and Notices of Deficiency will be mailed to \nclaimants based on pre-determined criteria. \nWe understand that the County's records prevail, and therefore we expect to not process disputes \nto the data and not approve claims from people who are not in the original data.  Given the \npossibility for people with aliases and name changes compared to the original database, we plan \nto allow people who are not on the class list to request claim tonns and file claims, and then \ndetermine the eligibility when and if they file a claim. \nOur estimate assumes that processing fonns will require an average of 5.5 to 7 minutes per claim \nform, depending on the volume received.  The actual time required for processing forms may be \ngreater or less. \nWe understand the County's records will be fairly comprehensive with respect to Social Security \nNumbers, and this should aid us significantly in consolidating records of people with multiple \nbookings under different names. \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 68 of 77\nBarry Litt, Esq. \nJune 23, 2007 \nPage 4. \nWhen the processing work is complete, we will provide the parties with the lists of names and \naddresses ofvaJid Claim Forms received.  Claimants with rejected claims will be sent a Notice of \nRejected Claim. \nThroughout the claims procedure, we will provide on a weekly basis statistics regarding \nmailings, re-mailings, claims processed, opt-outs received and whatever other information is \ndesired. \nFunds Distribution: \nWe will obtain a settlement fund taxpayer lD and establish the settlement fund bank accounts at \nour high volume bank, the Bank of America North Coast Commercial Banking Office in Santa \nRosa, California. \nChecks will be printed on an 8 y,\"  x 11\" sheet, with the check printed on safety paper at the top \none-third ofthe sheet and a transmittal letter on the bottom two-thirds. \nWhen the checks are issued, we will utilize the bank's Positive Pay system and will monitor the \naccounts on a daily basis to deter fraudulent attempts to cash checks and other debit attempts.  In \naddition, we will download the data for cashed checks on a weekly basis to update our \ncomputerized check register.  In this way, we know on a current basis what checks are cleared \nand therefore can quickly respond to requests from claimants who have misplaced their checks \nand aren't sure if the checks were cashed.  We also handle all stop-payment/reissue requests, and \nfollow-up with undeliverable checks. \nThere will be three rounds of issuing checks.  The first round will be right after the claims are \nfiled.  Round two will be after the checks from Round One become stale, and will pay claimants \nwho cashed their first round checks.  We estimate that 90% of the claims filed in the first round \nwill cash their checks.  The third round will occur after all opt-outs have been resolved. In \nRounds 2 and 3, the number of class members who receive distributions will be reduced, based \non eliminating those with the lowest number of points, so that those receiving distributions will \nall receive at least $50 per person. \nGiven the anticipated time frame for the three rounds of distribution, estimated at over two years, \nwe have budgeted for 20 hours per month for 2 y, years in staff time to handle requests from \nclaimants to reissue checks. \nDamaseo & Associates, a CPA finn that specializes in settlement fund tax services, will prepare \nthe settlement fund federal and state tax returns as required.  Our estimate assumes one year's tax \nreturns will be prepared.  We have budgeted for four years' of tax returns. \nTotal Estimated Cost: \nThe total estimated cost, assuming there are 165,000 class members, ranges from approximately \n$745,000 to $1,021,000, depending on the number of claims filed.  The actual cost will depend \non the actual number of claims filed and paid, and for the staff time to conduct our work.  \\Ve \n64 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 130      Filed 09/21/2007     Page 69 of 77\nBarry Lilt, Esq. \nJune 23, 2007 \nPage 5. \nwill bill at the unit rates quoted in the estimate and our staff hours will be billed at $75 per hour. \nWe will provide a summary invoice for the data setup, printing/mailing and published notice \nprior to the initial mailing, and will invoice on a monthly basis thereafter. \nBarry, 1 think that we have covered all the details of the Settlement Administration Plan.

Plaintiffs'  complaint  asserts  both  federal  and  state  la \nViOlat~f \n28  cau'ee of  action,  A 42  U,S.C.  ,  \"'3 federal  claim for \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 2 of 13\nI  'C \n\\ \n1  the  Fourth  and  Eighth Amendment;  California  Civil  Code  ยง  52.1(b); \n2  Article One,  Sections  I,  '7,  13,  and  17  of  the  California \n3  Constitution;  California  Penal  Code  section  4030;  and  California \n4  Government  Code  section 815.6.  Defendants  have  filed a  motion  to \n5  dismiss  most,  if not  all,  of  the  state  law  causes  of  action and  to \n6  dismiss  Sheriff  Gary  Penrod  on  the  section  1983  claim.  For  the \n7  reasons  set  forth  below,  the  motion  to  dismiss  is GRANTED  IN  PART \n8  and DENIED  IN  PART. \n9  When  a  party asserts  that  a  complaint  should be  dismissed \n10  pursuant ยทto  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b) (6),  the  court  must \n11  accept  as  true  all  the  material  allegations  contained  in  the \n12  complaint  and  must  also  construe  those  allegations  in  the  light  most \n13  favorable  to the  complaining  party.  See  Sanders  v.  Kennedy,  794 \n14  F.2d  478,  481  (9th  Cir.  1986). \n15  When  judging  the  allegations  in  the  complaint,  a  court  is not \n16  confined  solely  to  what  is contained  in  the  complaint  itself.  A \n17  court  may  also  \"consider  .  .  material  which  [was]  properly \n18  submitted as  part  of  the  complaint.\"  Hal  Roach  Studios.  Inc.  v. \n19  Richard  Feiner  & Co.,  896  F.2d  1542,  1555  n.19  Cir.  1990). \n(9~ \n20  Moreover,  \"documents  whose  contents  are  alleged  in  a  complaint  and \n21  whose  authenticity no  party questions,  but  which  are  not  physically \n22  attached  to  the pleading,  may  be  considered  \"  Branch v. \n23  Tunnell,  14  F.3d  449,  454  Cir.  1994). \n(9~ \n24  After  reviewing  the  allegations  in the  complaint  in  this \n25  manner,  it must  appear  beyond  a  doubt  that  \"no  relief  could be \n26  granted under  any  set of  facts  that  could be  proved  consistent  with \n27  the  allegations.\"  Hishon v.  King  & Spalding,  467  U.S.  69,  73 \n28  (1984). \n2 \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGoL-O P     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 3 of 13\n1  Plaintiffs  sued  Sheriff Gary  Penrod  both  in his  official \n2  capacity and  his  individual  capacity.  The  latter is based  on  the \n3  allegation  that  he  \"was  responsible  for  the  development, \n4  establishment  and/or  implementation of  the  procedures,  policies, \n5  regulations,  practices  and/or  customs  of  the  [San  Bernardino \n6  Sheriff's Department]  with respect  to  its detention of  prisoners.\" \n7  (Second  Am.  Compl.  ~ 14).  Defendants  assert  that  suit  cannot  be \n8  maintained Sheriff  Penrod  in either capacity. \n9  A suit  against  an  individual  in his  official  capacity  is,  in \n10  reality,  a  suit against  the  government  entity  itself.  See  Gomez  v. \n11  Vernon,  255  F.3d  1118,  1126  (9th  Cir.  2001).  Where  the  government \n12  entity is also  being  sued,  there  is no  purpose  served by  maintaining \n13  the  suit against  a  individual  defendant  sued  in his  official \n14  capacity.  Insofar  as  plaintiffs are  already suing  the  County,  their \n15  complaint  against  Sheriff  Penrod  in his  official  capacity  is \n16  superfluous  and  therefore  it is DISMISSED.  See  Green v.  Baca,  306 \n17  F.Supp.2d  903,  907  (C.D.  Cal.  2004)  (\"a  suit  against  a  state official \n18  in his  or her  official  capacity  is  not  a  suit  against  the  official \n19  but  a  suit  against  the  official's office\");  Vance  v.  County  of  Santa \n20  Clara,  928  F.  Supp.  993,  996  (N.D.  Cal.  1996) (llif individuals  are \n21  being  sued  in  their official  capacity as  municipal  officials and  the \n22  municipal  entity itself is also  being  sued,  then  the  claims  against \n23  the  individuals  are duplicative  and  should be  dismissed\") . \n24  Defendants  also  assert  that  Sheriff  Penrod  cannot  be  held \n25  individually  liable  for  promulgating  and  implementing  the  policy \n26  challenged  in the  complaint  as  such  a  basis  for  liability is barred \n27  when  a  Monell  claim  is  lodged  against  the  governmental  entity for \n28  that  same  policy.  \"When  plaintiffs assert  they were  injured by  the \n3 \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 4 of 13\no \n1  execution of  a  government's  policy or  the  government  is \nc~stom, \n2  liable  for  the  injury under  ยง  1983,  and  a  claim against  any  person \n3  in an  individual  capacity  is precluded.\"  (Defs'  Mot.  Dismiss  at  6)  . \n4  This  is  an  incorrect  statement  of  the  law. \n5  In  Kirkpatrick v.  City of  Los  Angeles,  803  F.2d  485  (9th  Cir. \n6  1986),  an  action was  filed  challenging  the  strip searching  of  police \n7  officers  accused of  misconduct.  A Monell  claim was  lodged  against \n8  the  City and  a  section  1983  claim was  filed  against  the  Chief  of \n9  Police  in his  individual  capacity  for  promulgating  the  \"unwritten \n10  policyยท  that  led  to  such  strip searches.  The  Chief  of  Police \n11  asserted  that  he  could  not  be  held  individually liable  \"because  he \n12  did not  personally participate  in the  decision  to  search  the \n13  officersยท  and  that,  absent  such  direct participation,  he  could not \n14  be  held  liable.  Id.  491  n.5.  In other words,  drafting  the  policy \n15  itself was  not  sufficient  for  individual  liability to  attach  as  it \n16  was  subsumed  within  the  Monell  claim  itself.  The  Ninth  Circuit  did \n17  not  address  the  argument,  finding  that  the  Chief  was  entitled to \n18  qualified  immunity. \n19  The  question  left  unresolved  in Kirkpatrick was  answered  five \n20  years  later by  the  Ninth  Circuit,  sitting gn bane,  in Redman  v. \n21  County  of  San  Diego,  942  F.2d  1435  (9th  Cir.  1991) (en  bane),  a  case \n22  which  neither defendants  nor  plaintiffs cite  in their pleadings.' \n23 \n24 \nIt must  be  noted  that,  even  before  Kirkpatrick,  the \n25  Ninth  Circuit had noted that  individual  liability remained post \nMonell.  \"After Monell  v.  Department  of  Social  Servs.,  436  U.S. \n26 \n658,  690  (1978),  however,  suit  may  be  brought  directly against  a \nlocal  governmental  unit,  rendering  suit  against  the  individuals \n27 \nunnecessary unless  they  are  sued  in  their personal  capacity.ยท \nSoffer v.  City of  Costa  Mesa,  798  F.2d  361,  363  (9th  Cir. \n28 \n1986) (emphasis  added). \n4 \n\nโข \no \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 5 of 13\n1  Redman  concerned  the  County's  policy regarding  the  housing  of \n2  homosexual  detainees.  The  plaintiffs brought  a  Monell  claim against \n3  the  County  and  also  sought  to hold  the  sheriff  individually liable \n4  for  his  participation  in  the  promulgation  of  the  policy  in  question. \n5  The  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  the  sheriff  could  be  held  individually \n6  liable.\"  The  court  noted  that  in order  for  individually  liability to \n7  attach to  state  officials,  they  must  have  had  either a  \"personal \n8  involvement  in the  constitutional  deprivation,\"  or  there  must  exist \n9  a  sufficient  causal  connection between  the  action  complained  of  and \n10  the  official  sued.  Id.  at  1446.  With  respect  to  prison policies, \n11  the  court  found  that \n12  liability exists  even  without  overt  personal \nparticipation  in the  offensive  act  if \n13  supervisory officials  implement  a  policy  so \ndeficient  that  the  policy  \"itself  is a \n14  repudiation  of  constitutional  rightsยท  and  is \n\"the  moving  force  of  the  constitutional \n15  violation.\" \n16  Id.  Thus,  the  requisite  causal  connection  can  be  established by  the \n17  state official  setting  in motion  a  policy which  the  official  knows \n18  or  reasonably  should  know  would  cause  others  to  inflict  the \n19  constitutional  injury.  Id.  at  1447.  Merely  being  familiar  with  the \n20  policy or  implementing  it as  directed by  one's  supervisor,  however, \n21  is  not  sufficient  to  attach  liability.  Rather,  the  official  \"must \n22  have  been  responsible  for  developing  and  promulgating  the  policies \n23  in question.\"  rd.  at  1449.  This  is exactly what  the  plaintiffs' \n24  complaint  alleges  that  Sheriff  Penrod  did:  He  drafted and  then \n25  implemented  the  policy that  was  the  source  of  their asserted \n26  constitutional  injury.  As  such,  he  can  be  held  directly liable  in \n27  his  individual  capacity. \n28  Defendants  next  challenge  plaintiffs'  efforts  to  pursue  a  class \n5 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 6 of 13\n1  action  for  a  violation of  California  Civil  Code  section 52.1(b), \n2  asserting  that  such  a  remedy  is  not  available  for  that  claim.  They \n3  note  that  a  federal  district  court  for  the  Eastern District  of \n4  California  has  so  held.  See  Taggart  v.  Solano  County,  2005  WL \n5  3325752  (E.D.  Cal.  Dec.  6,  2005).  That  court  reasoned  that  section \n6  52.1(b)  expressly limits  civil  actions  brought  by  private parties  to \n7  those  \"on  his  or her  own  behalf,\"  and  that  subsection  Ca)  provides  a \n8  class  action  remedy  but  limits  such  relief  to  suits  filed by  the \n9  state Attorney General,  district attorneys,  and  city attorneys  \"in \n10  the  name  of  the  people  of  the  State of  California.\"  ld.  at  * 4.  As \n11  the  Taggart  court  explained:  \"[T]he  legislation addresses \n12  representative  actions  but  only provides  for  such  actions  under \n13  Section  52.1(a),  not  Section  52.1(b).  Because  the  language  and \n14  structure  of  the  statute  reveal  that  Section  52.1(b)  does  not \n15  authorize  a  representative  action,  the  Section  52.l(b)  class  claim \n16  is dismissed.\"  ld. \n17  The  Court  finds  such  a  rationale  less  than persuasive.  The \n18  Taggart  court,  first  and  foremost,  appears  to  read  too  much  into  the \n19  fact  that  subsection  (b)  uses  the  term  \"on  his  or  her  own  behalf.\" \n20  The  subsection's  use  of  that  term may  more  simply be  read  as  a  means \n21  to  distinguish  itself  from  subsection  (a),  which  authorized  suits by \n22  the  state Attorney General  for  statutory violations.  Cf.  Corbett  v. \n23  Superior Court,  101  Cal.App.4th  649,  670  (2002) (refusing  to  read \n24  particular section of  unfair competition  laws  as  precluding  the \n25  ability to  seek  a  class  action without  a  \"suggestion\"  in  the \n26  statutory text).  The  import  of  the  \"distinction\"  cited to by  the \n27  Taggart  court  is therefore  far  from  clear,  or  even  that  suggestive. \n28  Even  more  damaging  to  the  Taggart  court's  construction of  the \n6 \n\n. \n~ \nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 7 of 13\n1  statute  is  the  fact  that  subsection  (g)  makes  clear that  any  of  the \n2  remedies  available  under  section  52.1  are  in addition  to  \"any other \n3  action,  remedy,  or procedure  that  may  be  available  to  an  aggrieved \n4  individual  under  any  other provision of  law.\"  Such  \"other  remedy\" \n5  includes  that  provided by  California  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  section \n6  382,  the  class  action  statute.  Far  from  suggesting  a  limitation on \n7  a  private  citizen's ability to  bring a  class  action  subsection  (b) \n8  claim,  the  \"language  and  structure\"  of  section  52.1  suggest  that \n9  class  actions  remain  as  a  viable  alternative  for  individuals \n10  pursuing  a  subsection  (b)  cause  of  action.  Finally,  nowhere  in the \n11  statute's  legislative history  is  there  any  suggestion by  the  state \n12  legislature  that  it intended  to  limit  class  action  relief  for  a \n13  violation of  52.I(b).  Indeed,  other  than  the  single  decision  out  of \n14  the  Eastern District,  the  defendants  have  been  unable  to  cite  to  one \n15  federal  or  state  case  so  limiting  52.1(b).  Such  silence  is  all  the \n16  more  remarkable  given  that  the  statute has  been  on  the  books  since \n17  1987.  Accordingly,  the  Court  holds  that  a  class  action  is a  viable \n18  procedure  for  private  parties  litigating a  claim under  section \n19  52.I(b). \n20  Defendants  next  assert  that  plaintiffs  cannot  bring a  suit  for \n21  monetary  damages  for  a  violation of  sections  seven  or thirteen  to \n22  article  one  to  the  California  Constitution.  On  this  point, \n23  defendants  are  on  firm  footing  as  the  California Supreme  Court  has \n24  held  litigants cannot  bring  a  damage  claim directly under  those \n25  sections  to  the  California  Constitution,  in part  because  alternative \n26  statutory and/or  common  law  causes  of  action  remain  available  to \n27 \n28 \n7 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 8 of 13\n1  redress  such grievances.2  See  Katzberg  v.  Regeants  of  Univ.  Cal., \n2  29  Cal.4th  300,  303  (2002).  Accordingly,  plaintiffs'  third cause  of \n3  action  for  violations  of  sections  seven  and  thirteen  to  article  one \n4  to  the  California  Constitution  is hereby DISMISSED. \n5  This  leaves  the  last  point  raised by  defendants  - that  the \n6  failure  of  class  representatives  Karen  Craft  and  Elroy Hardy  to  file \n7  a  California  Tort  Claim with  the  County  prior to  filing  suit  bars \n8  those  representatives'  ability to recover  on  any  of  the  state  law \n9  claims  asserted  in  the  complaint. \n10  Before  a  party can  file  a  tort  action  seeking monetary  damages \n11  against  state or  local  officials,  he  or  she  must  first  present  a \n12  timely  claim with the  appropriate  governmental  body  for  its \n13  consideration.  See  CAL.  GOVT.  CODE  ยงยง  905.2,  915(b) i  Mazzola  v. \n14  Feinstein,  154  Cal.  App.3d  305  (1984).  In  the  words  of  the \n15  California  Supreme  Court,  \"[c]ompliance  with  the  claims  statutes  is \n16  mandatory;  and  failure  to  file  a  claim is  fatal  to  the  cause  of \n17  action.\"  City of  San  Jose  v.  Superior Court,  12  Cal.3d  447,  452 \n18  (1974);  see  also  Karim-Panahi  v.  Los  Angeles  Police Dept.,  839  F.2d \n19  621  (9th  Cir.  1988) (holding  that  failure  to  comply  with  state-\n20  imposed  procedural  conditions  to  sue  the  state bars  consideration of \n21  even pendent  state  law  claims  by  the  federal  courts) . \n22  Craft  and  Hardy  admit  that  they never  presented  a  claim to  the \n23  County  Board  of  Supervisors  before  the  instant  suit  was  filed. \n24  (Opp.  at  2-3).  They  argue,  however,  that  they did  not  need  to  as \n25 \n26  Defendants  have  not  argued  that  plaintiffs'  effort  to \n2 \nseek monetary  damages  for violations  of  sections  one  or  seventeen \n27 \nto  article one  to  the  California  Constitution  is  similarly barred \nand,  accordingly,  those  claims  remain  undisturbed by  this  Court's \n28 \nruling. \n8 \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 9 of 13\n(j \n1  another  class  representative,  Ranettee  Sanchez,  had  done  so  before \n2  the  suit  was  filed.  This  argument  is predicated upon  the  California \n3  Supreme  Court's  holding  in San  Jose.  There  the  court  held  that  an \n4  administrative  claim may  be  filed on  behalf  of  a  class  such  that \n5  individual 'claims  need  not  be  filed by  each  class  member.  For  this \n6  to happen\"  however,  the  court  noted  the  information presented  in the \n7  tort  claim filed with  the  governmental  body must  be  in  \"substantial \n8  compliance\"  with  the  Government  Code  section's  910  statutory \n9  requirements. \n10  Here,  Sanchez'S  tort  claim submitted  to  the  County  Board  of \n11  Supervisors  was  done  so  on  her  on  behalf  as  well  as  \"all others \n12  similarly situated\"  who  have  been  \"wrongly  subjected  to  strip and \n13  body  cavity searches  while  in  the  custody of  the  San  Bernardino \n14  County  Sheriff's  Department.\"  Defendants  concede  that  Sanchez's \n15  tort  claim substantially complied  with  the  statute  for purposes  of \n16  her  individual  claim.  They  dispute  whether  it did  so  for  purposes \n17  of  making  out  a  class  claim.  Whether  the  phrase  \"all others \n18  similarly situated\"  would  constitute  substantial  compliance  was  left \n19  open  by  the  California  Supreme  Court.  Two  California  appellate \n20  court  decisions,  however,  have  shed  some  light  on  the  subject.  See \n21  Eaton v.  Ventura  Port  District,  45  Cal.App.3d  862  (1975);  Dhuyyetter \n22  v.  City of  Fresno,  110  Cal.App.3d  659  (1980). \n23  Both  California  courts  started from  the  proposition that,  \"in \n24  order  for  a  class  claim  to  be  considered  to  substantially comply \n25  with Government  Code  section  910,  it must  contain  sufficient \n26  information  to  enable  the  governmental  entity  .  .  to  reasonably \n27  determine  the  circumstances  which  it is  claimed give  rise  to \n28  liability and  the possible outer limits  of  that  liability.\"  Eaton, \n9 \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 10 of 13\n1  45  Cal.App.3d  at  868.  That  means  that  \"the  circumstances  of  the \n2  occurrence  and  a  description of  the  liability\"  set  forth  in  the \n3  class  claim must  \"establish a  well-defined  community  of  interest  in \n4  questions  of  law  and  fact\"  so  as  \"to portray  [a]  community  of \n5  interest.\"  Id.  at  869.  Class  claims  containing  \"diverse  and \n6  individualized\"  theories  of  liability or  factual  scenarios \n7  underlying  those  theories  do  not  meet  this  test.  Id. \nS  In Eaton  the  class  claim sought  relief  for  \"all  [those] \n9  similarly situated,  who  were  owners  of  boats  and  other property \n10  damaged,  and/or  destroyed or  lost  at  the  Ventura  Marina  in  San \n11  Buenaventura,  California,\"  \"when,  as  a  result  of  abnormally  heavy \n12  rains,  the  Santa  Clara  River  overflowed,  flooded  the  marina  and \nl3  damaged  boats  and  other property located there.\"  The  facts  and \n14  legal  theories  underlying  the  plaintiffs'  were  widely divergent.  As \n15  the  court  noted:  \"Some  plaintiffs are  lessees  who  leased varying \n16  types  of  space  in the  marina,  some  are  not.  Some  plaintiffs  had \n17  boats  damaged,  others  lost  them  entirely.  Some  plaintiffs  suffered \n18  damage  to other  types  of  personal  property.  Some  plaintiffs \n19  apparently  suffered personal  injury,  others  did  not.\" \n20  The  same  divergence  was  also  apparent  in  the  legal  theories \n21  pressed by  plaintiffs:  \"The  claimed  liability of  the  several \n22  defendants  varies  according  to  their particular relationship  to  or \n23  activity in connection with  the  marina  in terms  of  diverting  and \n24  channeling  the  Santa Clara  River,  construction of  the  marina, \n25  operation of  the  marina  or providing  police  protection  in  the  area.\" \n26  The  court  held  that  such wide  divergence  and  diversity  in terms \n27  of  the  factual  and  accompanying  legal  nature  of  the  allegations \n28  pressed  in the  class  claim did  not  articulate  a  \"community  of \n10 \n\nโข  โข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 11 of 13\n1  interest\"  sufficient  to make  it reasonable  for  the  governmental \n2  defendants  to  \"determine  the  circumstances  which  it  is  claimed  give \n3  rise  to  the  liability and  the  possible  outer  limits  of  that \n4  liability. \"  As  the  court  succinctly stated:  \"The  only  common \n5  feature  appearing  in  the  various  allegations  is the  flooding  of  a \n6  river.\" \n7  In Dhuyyetter,  the  class  claim was  filed  \"on  behalf  of  named \n8  property owners  adjacent  to  the  Fresno Airport  and  'those  residing \n9  with  them'  and  'on behalf  of  all persons  similarly adversely \n10  affected by  jet aircraft  operations  at  Fresno Air  Terminal,\"  namely \n11  \"damages  resulting  from  overflights  of  airplanes  using  the  air \n12  field,  alleging  such  inconveniences  as  noise,  air pollution,  etc., \n13  and  diminution  of  property value.\"  Later  the  plaintiffs  sought  to \n14  amend  their complaint  to  include  the  children of  the  homeowners  as \n15  additional  class members.  The  question  for  the  court  was  whether \n16  the  class  claim provided  sufficient notice  that  the  children of  the \n17  homeowners  were  potential  litigants.  The  court  held  that  it was. \n18  \\\\[T]heir  residence  and  the  locale  and  source  of  the  personal \n19  injuries  allegedly  inflicted were  the  same  as  those  of  their \n20  parents.\" \n21  The  Court  finds  that  the  class  claim presented by  Sanchez  is \n22  closer  to  that  in Dhuyyetter  than Eaton.  Defendants'  principal \n23  argument  in  this  regard  is  that  Sanchez'S  claim makes  reference  to  a \n24  multitude  of  causes  of  action  from  \"intentional  infliction of \n25  emotional  distress\"  to  \"battery\"  to  \"conversion\"  to  \"false \n26  imprisonment.\"  To  defendants  such  multiplicity is  indicative  of  a \n27  divergence  of  interests defeating any possibility that  there  exists \n28  a  community  of  interests  among  the  class members  sought  to  be \n11 \n\nโข \n. \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 12 of 13\n1  identified  in Sanchez's  claim.  Defendants'  argument  would  have  much \n2  to  it if  the  various  legal  theories  identified in Sanchez's  claim \n3  were  tethered to  a  multitude  of  factual  scenarios  giving  rise  to \n4  them.  That,  however,  is  not  the  case.  As  plaintiffs'  counsel \n5  persuasively noted  during  the  oral  argument  the  manifold  of  legal \n6  theories  identified in  Sanchez's  claim were  lisied as  potential \n7  avenues  of  recovering  for  the  single  act  of  the  defendants  in strip \n8  searching  all  detainees.  Thus,  unlike  Eaton,  there  does  not  appear \n9  to be  as  much  factual  or  legal  diversity  in  the  nature  of  the  claim \n10  pressed.  All  relate  to  a  finite  event  the  allegedly  \"unnecessary, \n11  unreasonable  and  illegal  strip and  body  cavity searches\"  of  those  in \n12  the  County's  custody.  It  is true  that  the  legal  and  factual \n13  justification sanctioning  such  searches  would  vary  individual  to \n14  individual,  but  the  nature  of  the  claim pressed was  that  such \n15  individualized suspicion was  totally lacking  as  the  County  had  a \n16  policy  to  conduct  the  wholesale  strip  searching  of  individuals \n17  regardless  of  the  nature  of  the  offense  bringing  them  into  the \n18  defendants'  custody. \n19  Admittedly,  Craft  is  listed in  the  complaint  as  a  class \n20  representative  for  those  who  were  \"taken  from  jail to  court,\" \n21  \"became  entitled to  release  after going  to  court\"  and  were \n22  subsequently  \"strip and/or visual  body  cavity searched before \n23  release.\"  (Second  Am.  Comp!.  42).  This  subset  in the  class, \n~ \n24  however,  was  picked up  by  Sanchez's  class  claim that  the  injury  she \n25  suffered occurred  \"upon  claimant's  return to  jail from  the  San \n26  Bernardino  courthouse  and  while  in  custody  of  the  San  Bernardino \n27  Sheriff's Department.\" \n28  The  fact  that  class  representatives  Craft  and  Hardy  did not \n12 \n\nโข \nCase 5:05-cv-00359-SGL-OP     Document 44      Filed 03/23/2006     Page 13 of 13\n1  file  a  California  Tort  Claim prior  to  the  filing of  the  instant  suit \n2  does  not  serve  to  foreclose  their ability to pursue  any  of  the  state \n3  law  claims  pressed  in their complaint  as  one  of  the  class \n4  representatives  did  submit  a  class  claim beforehand  that  was  in \n5  substantial  compliance  with  Government  Code  section  910. \n6  Accordingly,  plaintiffs'  section 1983  claim against  Sheriff \n7  Penrod  in his  official  capacity  is DISMISSED,  and  that  portion \n8  of plaintiffs'  third cause  of  action  for  violations  of  sections \n9  seven  and  thirteen to  article  one  of  the  California Constitution  is \n10  DISMISSED.
