    "summary": "<p>This case, Streit v. the County of Los Angeles, was one of many cases filed against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department [LASD] in the late 1990s and early 2000 that challenged various alleged policies and/or practices of the LASD and the operation of its Jail.  The suit in Streit was filed on November 30, 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  Streit alleged that she was subject to \"overdetention\" - that she were detained in the L.A. County Jail after all legal justification for her detention ended, in violation of both federal and state law.</p><p>Defendants moved to dismiss the case on various grounds.   Presiding District Judge William J. Rea denied the motion.  Defendants appealed, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a consolidated appeal, with the opinion being written by Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw.  Streit v. County of Los Angeles, 236 F.3d 552 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that Los Angeles County would be subject to liability under § 1983; the sheriff's department was \"public entity'' that could be subject to suit; and sheriff's department was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity).</p><p>On February 27, 2001, the district court stayed further action in the case while the parties pursued settlement negotiations.  Eventually,  Streit was consolidated with the lead case, Williams v. Block, Case No. CV-97-03826-WJR (C.D.Cal.) [JC-CA-33].  </p><p>Four settlement status reports were filed with the district court.  The LASD entered into a global settlement agreement, filed in November 2001, that resolved issues in the Streit case and some dozen other lawsuits pending in federal and state court.  Plaintiffs in those suits fell into three classes:  1) \"overdetentions\" (i.e., persons not released from custody from the Los Angeles County jails within a reasonable period of time after they became entitled to release); 2) strip and/or visual body cavity searches of persons who had been returned to jail from court to be processed for release; and 3) wrong warrant arrests and detentions (persons arrested on a warrant that in fact was for another person, and held for an unreasonable period of time before being released).  As part of the settlement, LASD eventually agreed to pay $27 million in damages and also agreed to institute major injunctive-type reforms.  The class damages portion of the settlement was handled by the court in Williams v. Block [See JC-CA-33 for a case summary].  The injunctive component was resolved and approved in the state court case, Riley v. the County of Los Angeles.  [See JC-CA-56 for a case summary].  </p><p>We have no information reflecting any post-settlement activity in the case.</p><p></p>",

The answer to this\nquestion determines whether the County may be subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v. New\nYork City Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Because we conclude\nthat the LASD, when implementing its policy of conducting prisoner release records checks, acts for the County\nin its capacity as the administrator of the Los Angeles County jails, we hold that both the LASD and the County\n556 are *556 subject to liability under section 1983. We also reject the LASD's contention that it is an \"arm of the\nstate,\" reiterating our determination that it is subject to liability under section 1983. We also conclude that the\nLASD is a \"public entity\" that is separately suable in federal court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291\nand 1292(b), and we affirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nAppellees brought suit against the County, its late Sheriff, Sherman Block, the LASD, and various LASD officials\nresponsible for the management and operation of the Los Angeles County jails. The appellees allege that they\nwere detained in county jails after all legal justification for their seizure and detention ended, in violation of both\nfederal and state law.\nBefore an inmate is released from prison, the LASD conducts a check of the Automated Justice Information\nSystem (\"AJIS\"), a computerized law enforcement database, to confirm that the prisoner is not wanted by any\nother law enforcement agency. It is the LASD's policy, however, to run the AJIS check only after all wants and\nholds that arrive on the day a prisoner is scheduled for release are inputted into the database. Due to the high\nvolume of wants and holds received each day, the inputting process can, and often does, take between one to\ntwo days to complete. It is only after the inputting process is complete and the computer check run, that the\nLASD begins the administrative steps toward a prisoner's release. Although no longer required to serve time,\nthese prisoners must remain in jail during the inputting period, extending their incarceration beyond their release\n[1]\ndate.\n[2]\nAppellees seek monetary damages for overdetention in each of these six separately filed actions.  The County\nand LASD moved to dismiss the appellees' suits. In all of the district court actions but one, the County moved\n[3]\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the section 1983 claims brought against it.  In the\n[4]\nother district court action, the County moved for summary judgment on the appellees' section 1983 claims.  The\nLASD moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss all six actions in one consolidated motion.\nRelying on McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997), and the California\n557 Court of Appeal decision in County of Los Angeles*557v. Superior Court (Peters), 68 Cal. App.4th 1166, 80\nCal.Rptr.2d 860 (Ct.App. 1998), the County argued that because the Sheriff of Los Angeles (the \"Sheriff\")\nfunctions as a state 00 not county 00 official engaged in a law enforcement function, the County cannot be sued\n97 97\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the alleged constitutional torts of the Sheriff or his deputies. The LASD similarly\n[5]\ncontended that because it is an \"arm of the state,\"  the LASD is not within the section 1983 definition of\n\"person,\" and therefore it could not be held liable. The LASD also urged dismissal on the grounds that it is not a\nseparately suable public entity under California Government Code § 811.2.\nThe district court rejected each of these arguments and denied the LASD's motion to dismiss all claims. It denied\n[6]\nin part, and granted in part, the County's five motions for dismissal in a series of roughly identical orders.  In its\njoint-tentative ruling denying the County's motions to dismiss and the LASD consolidated motion to dismiss, the\ndistrict court distinguished Peters, which broadly held that \"in setting policies concerning the release of persons\nfrom the Los Angeles County jail, the Los Angeles County Sheriff acts as a state officer performing state law\nenforcement duties, and not as a policymaker on behalf of the County of Los Angeles.\" Peters, 68 Cal.App.4th at\n1178, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 868. The court noted that the law enforcement function involved in Peters was\n\"determining whether to release a person who may be subject to arrest on an outstanding warrant.\" It found that,\nhere, \"the overdetention had nothing to do with the sheriff's law enforcement function [because,] [i]n contrast to \nPeters, there is no dispute that Plaintiffs were entitled to be released.\" Rather, \"the sheriff's conduct at issue\nrelates to a purely administrative function,\" and \"where the Sheriff acts in a purely administrative manner such\naction is pursuant to their [sic] county, not state, authority.\" Thus, the district court held that the LASD was subject\nto 1983 liability for these actions.\nThe district court also addressed the LASD's claim that it was not a separately suable entity. Relying on our\ndecisions in Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 839 F.2d 621, 624 n. 2 (9th Cir.1988), and Shaw v.\nCalifornia Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 788 F.2d 600, 604-05 (9th Cir.1986), the district court ruled that\nthe LASD is a separately suable entity. It also rejected the LASD's argument that \"the amendment of Cal.\nEvid.Code § 669.1 in some way modified the definition of a `public entity.'\" The court reasoned, \"§ 669.1 is only\n\nintended to be an evidentiary limitation for cases involving public employees, and is not intended to redefine a\n`public entity.'\"\nRelying on these same reasons recited in its second tentative ruling, the district court denied in part, and granted\nin part, the County's motion for summary judgment dismissal of the section 1983 claims in the one action in which\n[7]\nit did not file a motion to dismiss.  The district court also used this tentative ruling to deny the County's\n558 remaining motion to dismiss. Specifically, the district court found that *558 \"the sheriffs were not state actors, but\nthey were acting on behalf of the County in the instant cases.\" Therefore, it concluded that the County was\nanswerable under section 1983 for the challenged overdetentions.\nOn May 25, 1999, the district court certified for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) all but one of\n[8]\nits orders denying the County's and the LASD's motions to dismiss.  On July 26, 1999, we granted the County\nand the LASD permission to appeal these certified interlocutory orders. The County and the LASD also timely\nfiled notices of appeal in each of these cases and those not certified on interlocutory appeal on the basis that the\ndistrict court's orders are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.\nII. JURISDICTION\nBecause we have granted the County and the LASD permission to appeal those orders that the district court\ncertified for interlocutory appeal, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) to review any issue fairly\nincluded within the certified orders. See Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199, 205, 116 S.Ct. 619, 133\nL.Ed.2d 578 (1996) (\"As the text of § 1292 indicates, appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the\ncourt of appeals, and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court.\"). Thus, we have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) to review appeals Nos. 99-55897, 99-55898, 99-55899, 99-56041,\n[9]\nand 99-56233.\nSection 1292(b), however, does not provide the jurisdictional basis for our review of all the appeals now before\nus. Appeal No. 99-56310 (the County's and the LASD's appeals from the district court's denials of their motions to\ndismiss in Gladney v. County of Los Angeles, et al., No. CV-99-00586-WJR) and No. 99-56766 (the County's\nappeal from the district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment in Williams v. Block, et al., No.\nCV-97-3826-WJR) have been neither certified by the district court nor approved for interlocutory appeal by this\ncourt. Nevertheless, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over these appeals under the collateral order doctrine\nand the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction.\nIn Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), the Supreme Court\nestablished the collateral order doctrine, holding that a district court order that \"did not make any step toward final\ndisposition of the merits of the case and will not be merged in final judgment\" is appealable as \"a final disposition\nof a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the cause of action and does not require consideration with it.\" Id.\nat 544-45, 69 S.Ct. 1221. In subsequent cases, the Court has upheld a circuit court's use of the collateral order\ndoctrine to entertain jurisdiction over appeals from the denial of a summary judgment motion that raised a\nqualified immunity defense. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 143,\n113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (holding \"that orders denying individual officials' claims of absolute and\nqualified immunity are among those that fall within the ambit of Cohen\"); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 527,\n105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (finding that \"[t]he denial of a defendant's motion for dismissal or\nsummary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity easily meets [the] requirements [of a collateral order]\"); \n559 id. at 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (\"[A] *559 district court's denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent it turns on\nan issue of law, is an appealable `final decision' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291 notwithstanding the\nabsence of a final judgment.\"). By direct application of this doctrine, we have jurisdiction in appeal No. 99-56310,\nregarding the LASD's appeal of the district court's order holding it potentially liable as a County actor and not\nimmune from suit in federal court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b).\nWe also conclude that we have jurisdiction over all aspects of appeal No. 99-56310 and No. 99-56766 under the\ndoctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction. In Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 115 S.Ct. 1203,\n131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995), the Supreme Court suggested that district court decisions that are \"inextricably\n\nintertwined\" may be appropriate for joint review under the doctrine of pendent party appellate jurisdiction. Id. at\n50-51, 115 S.Ct. 1203. Acting in accordance with Swint, a panel of this court in Huskey v. City of San Jose, 204\nF.3d 893, 904-05 (9th Cir.2000), recently applied pendent appellate jurisdiction to review two orders denying\nsummary judgment with jurisdictional facts similar to those present here. In Huskey, a former deputy city attorney\nsued the City of San Jose and the individual heads of the City Attorney's office under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking\ndamages for wrongful termination and various other torts. The district court denied the City of San Jose and\nindividual defendants' motions for summary judgment, which claimed a qualified immunity defense. The\nindividuals appealed the denial of summary judgment and we granted review. Id. at 898-902. We further found\nthat the order denying the City of San Jose's claim to summary judgment was inextricably intertwined with an\norder denying the individual's summary judgment motion and therefore employed pendent jurisdiction to hear the\nCity's appeal. Id. at 902-06. The same procedural and jurisdictional situation exists here.\nAccordingly, because the district court's orders denying the motions to dismiss in appeal No. 99-56310 and\ndenying the motion for summary judgment in appeal No. 99-56766 raise the same issues, use the same legal\nreasoning, and reach the same conclusions as the earlier orders over which we have jurisdiction under section\n1292(b), we find that appeals Nos. 99 56310 and 99-56766 are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the earlier orders. It\nis therefore proper exercise of our pendent appellate jurisdiction to review these appeals.\nHaving determined that we have jurisdiction, we turn now to a de novo review of the merits of the County's and\nthe LASD's appeals.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. County Liability\nThe question of the County's liability for the alleged constitutional torts of the LASD is governed by the analytical\nframework set out in McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997). In \nMcMillian, Alabama's Monroe County, like the County here, was sued for allegedly unconstitutional actions\nundertaken by the Monroe County Sheriff. A county is subject to section 1983 liability for such suits if its policies,\nwhether set by the government's lawmakers \"or by those whose edicts or acts that may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy,\" caused the particular constitutional violation at issue. Monell v. New York City Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\n436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Here, as in McMillian, the parties agree that the Sheriff\nis the policymaker whose actions are to be examined; they \"sharply disagree\" about whether the Sheriff is a\npolicymaker on behalf of the State, in which case no section 1983 action lies because the Sheriff would not be a\n\"person\" within the meaning of the statute, or on behalf of the County.\n560 *560 The Supreme Court in McMillian offered two principles which guide us in resolving this question. First, it\ncautioned against employing a \"categorical, all or nothing\" approach. Id. at 785, 117 S.Ct. 1734. Rather, we are\nto inquire \"whether governmental officials are final policymakers for the local government in a particular area or\non a particular issue.\" Id. Second, although the question of municipal liability under section 1983 is one of federal\nlaw, \"our inquiry is dependent on an analysis of state law.\" Id. at 786, 117 S.Ct. 1734. That is, \"our understanding\nof the actual function of a governmental official, in a particular area, will necessarily be dependent on the\ndefinition of the official's functions under relevant state law.\" Id. at 786, 117 S.Ct. 1734.\nThe appellants erroneously urge that only state law controls this appeal. In particular, the appellants rely almost\nexclusively on County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (Peters), 68 Cal.App.4th 1166, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 860\n[10]\n(Ct.App.1998), as the controlling authority.  Although we must consider the state's legal characterization of the\ngovernment entities which are parties to these actions, federal law provides the rule of decision in section 1983\nactions. See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 430 n. 5, 117 S.Ct. 900, 137 L.Ed.2d 55 (1997)\n(finding that \"the question whether a particular state agency has the same kind of independent status as a county\n... is a question of federal law ... [b]ut that federal question can be answered only after considering the provisions\nof state law that define the agency's character.\"); City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 124, 108 S.Ct.\n915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988) (noting that \"the identification of policymaking officials is a question of state law\").\nAnd, although it may be instructive on questions of liability in certain specific contexts, state law does not control\n\nour interpretation of a federal statute. To trigger section 1983 liability, plaintiffs must claim that their \"rights,\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and [federal] laws\" have been violated under the color of\nstate law or action. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \"The elements of, and the defenses to, a federal cause of action are\ndefined by federal law.\" Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356, 375, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990). Therefore,\nfederal courts have generally recognized the primary importance of federal law in section 1983 litigation. See \nHowlett, 496 U.S. at 376, 110 S.Ct. 2430; Monell, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611; Tiemann v. Tul-\nCenter, Inc., 18 F.3d 851 (10th Cir.1994); Larez v. Holcomb, 16 F.3d 1513, 1520 (9th Cir. 1994). Recognizing the\nappropriate deference to state law in the context of section 1983, the McMillian Court closely examined the\nAlabama Constitution, Code and case law, finding critical to its decision that the Alabama Supreme Court had\ninterpreted various of the relevant provisions and their historical background as evidence of \"`the framer's intent\nto ensure that sheriffs be considered executive officials of the state.'\" Id. at 789, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (citations\nomitted). After its detailed analysis of Alabama's governmental structure and allocation of powers and duties\namong its institutions, the Court concluded that \"Alabama sheriffs, when executing their law enforcement duties,\nrepresent the State of Alabama, not their counties.\" Id. at 793, 117 S.Ct. 1734. The Court, however, rejected a\n\"uniform, national characterization of all sheriffs,\" because \"such a blunderbuss approach would ignore a crucial\naxiom of our government: the States have wide authority to set up their state and local governments as they\nwish.\" Id. at 795, 117 S.Ct. 1734. Justice Ginsburg, in dissent, nevertheless emphasized the limited scope of \nMcMillian's holding through its \"Alabama-specific approach\" and its admonition to examine the particular function\n561 at issue in a given case. *561Id. at 804, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (Ginsburg, J. dissenting). As Justice Ginsburg noted, the\nmajority opinion did not question that a sheriff might be a county policymaker for some purposes and in some\nstates. Id.\nIn the cases before us, the district court found that the function in question was the effectuation of the release of\npersons where it is clear that there is no legal cause for their continued detention; and that in that function, the\nLASD acts pursuant to county, not state authority. The function as described by the district court may be overly\nnarrow. However, even if we view the function more broadly as the oversight and management of the local jail,\nwe are compelled to agree with the district court that the Sheriff acts for the County in this management function.\nThis conclusion is based on our own independent analysis of California's constitution, statutes, and case law. \nWeiner v. San Diego County, 210 F.3d 1025, 1029 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that a reviewing court must \"examine\nCalifornia's constitution, statutes, and case law\" when determining a county's liability under McMillian).\n[11]\nUnlike the Alabama Constitution,  the California Constitution does not list sheriffs as part of \"the state\n`executive department.'\" McMillian, 520 U.S. at 787, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (finding this designation \"especially\nimportant\" for determining liability). Instead, Article XI, section 1(b) of the California Constitution designates\nsheriffs as county officers. Cal. Const. art. XI, § 1(b) (\"The Legislature shall provide for ... an elected county\nsheriff....\"); see also DeGenova v. Sheriff of DuPage County, 209 F.3d 973, 976 (7th Cir.2000) (noting that the\nIllinois Constitution's designation of sheriffs as county officers \"strongly indicates that the Sheriff is an agent for\nthe county, and not the State\"). Indeed, \"[n]ot only does the California Constitution lack the provisions most\nimportant to the Supreme Court's decision in McMillian, its provisions read much like those of the Alabama\nConstitution prior to that State's determined effort to clarify that sheriffs were acting for the State when exercising\ntheir law enforcement functions.\" Roe v. County of Lake, 107 F.Supp.2d 1146, 1149 (N.D.Cal.2000); see \nMcMillian, 520 U.S. at 788, 117 S.Ct. 1734. Thus, under the California Constitution, the LASD is generally a\ncounty, not state, agency. Even more critical to our analysis, there is no provision in the California Constitution\nthat states that the LASD acts for the state when managing the local jails.\nThe California Government Code also supports the conclusion that the LASD operates for the County when\nadministering local prison policy. Although the California Attorney General, like the Alabama Attorney General in \nMcMillian, has statutory control over the sheriffs in a law enforcement capacity, in California, the counties hold the\nultimate power over the jails. Compare Cal. Gov.Code § 12560 (granting the Attorney General power over the\nsheriffs' activities relevant to the \"investigation or detection of crime\"), with Cal. Gov.Code § 25303 (granting the\ncounty boards of supervisors broad fiscal and administrative powers for the management of the individual county\njails so long as the boards do not \"obstruct the investigative function of the sheriff of the county\"). The counties\nretain the power to transfer control of a county jail from the sheriff to a county-created department of corrections,\nsuggesting that the counties actually control and operate the jails, and not the state via the sheriffs. Cal.\n\n562 Gov.Code § 23013; Beck v. County of Santa Clara, 204 Cal.App.3d 789, 793, 251 Cal.Rptr. 444, *562 445 (1988)\n. We find that sections 23013 and 25303 weigh heavily in favor of our conclusion that the LASD's jail-release\npolicies are a county function and a county concern. See Dotson v. Chester, 937 F.2d 920, 928 (4th Cir.1991)\n(interpreting a Maryland statute virtually identical to section 23013 and concluding that because \"state statutes\nconfer authority on the counties to transfer control of the jail from the sheriff to a county warden,\" it has \"no doubt\nbut that sheriffs are final policymakers for counties when operating jails\" (emphasis added)). Thus, under these\nstate statutes, the County, not the state, oversees the local jails, and the LASD, as the administrator of those\njails, acts for the County.\nOther provisions in the California Government Code further support the County's liability for the LASD's actions.\nUnder California law, monetary damages for section 1983 claims are paid by the County and not the state. Cal.\nGov.Code § 815.2. This crucial factor weighs heavily toward finding that, in the cases at hand, the LASD\nfunctions as a county, rather than a state, agency. See McMillian, 520 U.S. at 789, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (stating that it\nwas \"critical[ ] for our case\" and \"strong evidence in favor of the ... conclusion that sheriffs act on behalf of the\nState\" that a judgment against the sheriff would be a suit against the state, and that the county would not be\nliable for a sheriff's acts under respondeat superior). In California, sheriffs are elected county officers. See Cal.\nGov.Code § 24000(b) (providing that a sheriff be included as one of the county officers); Cal. Elec.Code § 314\n(defining a \"county officer\" as \"any elected officer enumerated in ... Section 24000 ... of the Government Code.\").\nSheriffs are required to have their offices at the county seat with the other county officers, Cal. Gov.Code §\n[12]\n24250; their vacancies are filled as \"provided by law for filling elective county offices;\"  Cal. Gov.Code §\n24205; and their services are contracted out by the counties 00 not the state. See Cal. Gov.Code § 53069.8; see\n97\nalso County of Los Angeles Charter §§ 56, 56, 56. These various state provisions lead inexorably to the\nconclusion that the LASD is tied to the County in its political, administrative, and fiscal capacities. Therefore, the\nCounty appears subject to liability for the LASD's actions.\nEven the Los Angeles County Code supports the conclusion that the LASD's connection to the County subjects\nthe County to potential liability. The LASD is an agency established and governed by the Los Angeles County\nCode. See Los Angeles County Code, ch. 2.34. The Los Angeles County Sheriff is an elected position that is\nestablished by the Los Angeles County Charter. See Los Angeles County Charter, art. IV, sec. 12. The Los\nAngeles County Board of Supervisors retains budgetary oversight and control over the LASD. See Los Angeles\nCounty Code, subch. 4.12.030. Like all other county agencies, the LASD submits budget requests to the LASD\neach fiscal year. See Los Angeles County Code, subch. 4.12.070. Whether under state or local law, the County\nappears liable for the LASD's actions.\nFinally, in reviewing the relevant case law, we find equally compelling evidence to hold the County liable for the\nLASD's conduct in administering the AJIS checks. Of particular importance to our analysis is Sullivan v. County of\nLos Angeles, 12 Cal.3d 710, 717, 117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 244, 527 P.2d 865, 868 (1974). In Sullivan, the California\nSupreme Court held that the County was liable for the Sheriff's failure to release a prisoner who had served a\ncompleted sentence. Jack Sullivan was to be released from a 50-day drunk driving sentence after a Los Angeles\n563 Superior Court issued an order dismissing the charges against Sullivan. Id. at 714, 117 *563 Cal.Rptr. 241, 242,\n527 P.2d 865, 866. Because the Superior Court neglected to file an order for his release, Sullivan remained in jail\nand served his full sentence. Id. Due to the administrative error relating to the previously unfiled release order, no\norder was issued to release Sullivan upon completion of his full sentence either. Id. Sullivan was finally released\ntwelve days after his sentence ended and nearly a month after his early release date. Id. at 715, 117 Cal.Rptr.\n241, 243, 527 P.2d 865, 867. The California Supreme Court held that the Sheriff's failure to release Sullivan\nresulted in his false imprisonment, and therefore held the County liable for damages. Id. at 716-17, 117 Cal.Rptr.\n241, 243-44, 527 P.2d 865, 868-69. The Sullivan court reasoned that \"when the jail term has expired; in the eyes\nof the law [the] plaintiff is no longer a `prisoner.'\" Id. at 717, 117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 244, 527 P.2d 865, 868. This\nholding is applicable to the cases at hand.\nOther cases further support holding the County responsible under section 1983 for the LASD's actions. In Beck v.\nCounty of Santa Clara, 204 Cal.App.3d 789, 251 Cal. Rptr. 444 (Ct.App.1988), the California Court of Appeals\nupheld the County of Santa Clara's exercise of authority over its local jails, when it chose to transfer the\nmanagement of the jails from the county sheriff to a newly created County Department of Detention. Id. at\n792-93, 251 Cal.Rptr. 444, 445-46. The Court of Appeals found that although sheriffs derive their powers from the\n\nstate in part, the control over the local prisons is within the authority of the individual counties. Id. at 795-805, 251\nCal.Rptr. 444, 446. A recent case from the Northern District of California, Roe v. County of Lake, 107 F.Supp.2d\n1146 (N.D.Cal.2000), is also instructive. In a well-reasoned opinion analyzing McMillian's application to a section\n1983 action against a local county sheriff and the county in which he was elected, the district court found that in\nthe setting of policies and administration of his office, the sheriff was the County's chief policymaker. We agree\nwith the district court's reasoning that:\nRecognizing that local police power is derived from the State, McMillian requires a court to\nanalyze the delegation of that power to determine whether it was sufficiently complete such that a\nsuit for abuse of that power is not a suit against the State. It seems clear ... that California's\ndelegation of authority to [the] Sheriff [here] is sufficiently complete. It is difficult to see how a\njudgment against a sheriff who, as is alleged here, permits his office to violate the civil rights of\nwomen in the way he maintains his staff and sets his policies, will operate as a judgment against\nthe state.\nId. at 1151 (citations omitted).\nThe County does not counter with any arguments predicated on an analysis of the California Constitution, codes,\nor regulations; nor does it urge upon us contrary provisions in its charter or regulations. Rather than conducting\nan independent analysis of California law, the County urges us simply to adopt the holding of County of Los\nAngeles v. Superior Court (Peters), 68 Cal.App.4th 1166, 80 Cal. Rptr.2d 860 (Ct.App.1998), in which the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal found that the LASD was a state actor and therefore immune from liability under 42\nU.S.C.1983. Peters sued the LASD and the County because the LASD held her for ten days after she had posted\nbail. The LASD overdetained Peters based on a facially-valid outstanding arrest warrant that was subsequently\nfound to have been issued for another person. Peters claimed the LASD reasonably should have known the\nwarrant did not apply to her and sought damages under section 1983.\nThe California Court of Appeal concluded that \"in setting the policies governing the release of prisoners from the\nLos Angeles County jail, the Los Angeles County Sheriff acts as a state official rather than a policymaking official\n564 for the County of Los *564 Angeles.\" Id. at 1168, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 861 (citing Pitts v. County of Kern, 17 Cal.4th\n[13]\n340, 70 Cal.Rptr.2d 823, 949 P.2d 920 (1998)).  Relying on Pitts and McMillian, the Peters court examined the\nrelevant sections of the California Government Code and state case law in reaching its conclusion. The County\nargues that Peters is analogous to the cases on appeal and therefore controls our analysis. We disagree.\nAlthough the general issue of overdetention was presented in both Peters and the cases at hand, the factual\nscenarios are quite distinct. In Peters, the LASD acted upon a facially-valid warrant in its detention of the plaintiff,\nwhere as here, in conducting AJIS checks, the LASD is conducting its own administrative search for outstanding\nwarrants, wants, or holds upon which it would be required to act, if they existed. Although this distinction may be\nperceived as subtle, for purposes of our analysis, it is critical. Acting upon a warrant is a law enforcement function\nwith which the LASD is tasked under California state law. See Cal. Gov.Code § 12560. Searching for wants and\nholds that may or may not have been issued for persons whom the state has no legal right to detain is an\nadministrative function of jail operations for which the LASD answers to the County. See Cal. Gov.Code §§\n25303, 26605. Whether or not the policy and practice of detaining persons beyond their term of incarceration for\nthis administrative function violates the Constitution will be a question for the trial court.\nMoreover, even if the case were on all fours we would not be bound by Peters's conclusion regarding section\n1983 liability because such questions implicate federal, not state, law. See Owen v. City of Independence, 445\nU.S. 622, 647 n. 30, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980); Weiner, 210 F.3d at 1029. Although we have never\nbefore addressed the question we resolve today, we note that our holding comports with the many cases in which\n[14]\nwe have assumed California sheriffs to be county policymakers for section 1983 purposes.\nUnder Monell, the County would be liable for section 1983 damages \"[i]f the sheriff's actions constitute county\n`policy.'\" McMillian, 520 U.S. at 783, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (citing Monell, 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018). Upon\nexamining the precise function at issue in conjunction with the state constitution, codes, and case law, we\n565 conclude that the LASD acts as the final *565 policymaker for the county when administering the County's\n\nrelease policy and not in its state law enforcement capacity. We therefore affirm the district court's holding that\nthe LASD, when functioning as the administrator of the local jail, is a County actor, and that the County may\ntherefore be subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nB. LASD Liability\n1. Suable Entity\nThe LASD also argues that it is not separately suable in federal court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17\n(b). In support of its argument, the LASD cites Garcia v. County of Los Angeles, 588 F.Supp. 700 (C.D.Cal.1984),\nin which the LASD was found to be a non-separately suable entity. In the cases at hand, the district court\nrecognized that in a more recent opinion, Shaw v. California Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 788 F.2d 600,\n605 (9th Cir.1986), we found a police department to be a separately suable entity and therefore declined to apply \nGarcia in favor of Shaw. As we pointed out in Shaw,\nUnder Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Police Department's capacity to be\nsued in federal court is to be determined by the law of California. Section 945 of the California\nGovernment Code provides that \"[a] public entity may sue or be sued.\" Section 811.2 of the\nGovernment Code defines a \"public entity to include `the State, the Regents of the University of\nCalifornia, a county, city, district, public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision\nor political corporation in the State.'\"\nId. at 604.\nRelying on California court decisions that \"held that a police department is a public entity under section 200 of the\nCalifornia Evidence Code,\" we then concluded that \"the courts of California would hold that the Police\nDepartment is a public entity under section 811.2.\" Shaw, at 604; see also Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police\nDep't, 839 F.2d 621, 624 n. 2 (9th Cir.1988) (\"Municipal police departments are `public entities' under California\nlaw and, hence, can be sued in federal court for alleged civil rights violations.\"). Thus, under Rule 17(b) a Police\nDepartment may be sued in Federal Court. Shaw, at 605.\nAlthough the appeals before us, unlike Shaw and Karim-Panahi, confront the suability of a sheriff's department\nrather than a police department, the LASD does not contend that Shaw and Karim-Panahi are distinguishable on\nthis ground, and we see no basis for such a distinction. Indeed, in reaching our decision in Shaw, we rejected the\nholding of Garcia, in which \"the district court held that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was not a\n`public entity' under § 811.2.\" Shaw, 788 F.2d at 604; see also Jackson v. Alameda County Sheriff's Dep't, No.\nC-92-4419-BAC, 1993 WL 174896, at *4 (N.D.Cal. May 14, 1993) (reading Shaw to hold that sheriff's\ndepartments are separately suable public entities under California law).\nThe LASD also argues that Shaw was subsequently undermined by a change in the California Evidence Code\nprovision on which it relied. However, our decision in Karim-Panahi, a progeny of Shaw, was rendered after the\nEvidence Code section to which the LASD points, section 669.1, was added. See Cal. Evid.Code § 669.1\nhistorical and statutory notes (West 1995). Therefore, even if the LASD's argument were availing, Karim-Panahi\nwould nevertheless control our decision. See Visness v. Contra Costa County (In re Visness), 57 F.3d 775, 778\n(9th Cir.1995) (stating that to the extent a prior panel's decision \"rests on state law, a change in California\nstatutory and common law ... would permit\" a subsequent panel \"to reconsider the issues decided by\" the prior\npanel (emphasis added)); Jones-Hamilton v. Beazer Materials & Servs., 973 F.2d 688, 696 n. 4 (9th Cir.1992)\n566 (noting that a prior panel's \"interpretation of California law is `binding in the absence of any subsequent*566\nindication from the California courts that our interpretation was incorrect'\" (emphasis added) (quoting Owen v.\nUnited States, 713 F.2d 1461, 1464 (9th Cir.1983))).\nMoreover, section 669.1 does not purport to alter the meaning of \"public entity,\" to have any impact on the\nEvidence Code section on which the Shaw Court actually relied (section 200), or to affect section 811.2 of the\nGovernment Code. See Cal. Evid.Code § 669.1. Thus, even if we were to entertain the LASD's argument, we\nwould reject it. The California legislature's enactment of section 669.1 \"does not provide the kind of indication that\n\nour past interpretation of California law was incorrect that would cause us to revisit our holding in [Shaw].\" Jones-\nHamilton, 973 F.2d at 696 n. 4.\nAccordingly, we agree with the district court and conclude that under Shaw and Karim-Panahi, the LASD is a\nseparately suable entity.\n2. Arm of the State Doctrine\nThe LASD further argues that even if we find that it is a separately suable entity, it is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity under the \"arm of the state\" doctrine. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520\nU.S. 43, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997); Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 70, 109\nS.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Agencies of the state are generally immune from private damage actions\nbrought in federal court. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984). The LASD contends that as an arm of the state, it is not a \"person\" within the meaning of\nsection 1983 and, therefore, can not be held liable for the overdetentions.\nThe district court did not formally engage in an arm of the state analysis, instead relying upon the reasoning set\nforth in an unpublished memorandum and order from the Northern District of California. There, the court, using a\nsomewhat informal arm of the state analysis itself, concluded that the Alameda County Sheriff was not an arm of\nthe state because it was acting in an administrative capacity for the county. Upon consideration of the appropriate\nfactors, however, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the LASD is not an arm of the state and\ntherefore does not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nIn determining whether an entity is an arm of the state we inquire whether \"`the state is the real, substantial party\nin interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials [or state\nentities] are nominal defendants.'\" Durning v. Citibank, 950 F.2d 1419, 1423 (9th Cir.1991) (alteration in original)\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Dep't of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945)). This is a\nquestion of federal law, which \"can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the\nagency's character.\" Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429 n. 5, 117 S.Ct. 900, 137 L.Ed.2d 55\n(1997).\nWe consider five factors when determining whether a governmental agency is an arm of the state:\nwhether a money judgment would be satisfied out of state funds, [2] whether the entity performs\ncentral governmental functions, [3] whether the entity may sue or be sued, [4] whether the entity\nhas the power to take property in its own name or only the name of the state, and [5] the corporate\nstatus of the entity.\nDurning, 950 F.2d at 1423 (quoting Mitchell v. Los Angeles Cmty Coll. Dist., 861 F.2d 198, 201 (9th Cir.1988)\n(citations omitted)).\nWe are satisfied that the LASD is not acting as an arm of the state when administering the local county jails. First,\n567 the County, not the state, is financially liable for the LASD's actions in its capacity as *567 the administrator of the\nlocal jails. Cal. Gov.Code § 815.2. As established in Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles, 12 Cal.3d 710, 717, 117\nCal.Rptr. 241, 527 P.2d 865 (1974), the County is liable specifically for the LASD's overdetention of individuals\nwho have served a completed prison sentence 00 the very actions at issue here. Id. at 716-17, 117 Cal.Rptr. 241,\n97\n244, 527 P.2d 865, 868. This factor, which weighs against the LASD's position, is the most important factor in\nidentifying an arm of the state. Durning, 950 F.2d at 1424; Jackson v. Hayakawa, 682 F.2d 1344, 1350 (9th\nCir.1982); Ronwin v. Shapiro, 657 F.2d 1071, 1073 (9th Cir.1981); see also Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson\nCorp., 513 U.S. 30, 49, 115 S.Ct. 394, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994) (noting that, in determining whether an entity is an\narm of the state, \"the vast majority of Circuits ... have concluded that the state treasury factor is the most\nimportant factor to be considered ... and, in practice, have generally accorded this factor dispositive weight\"\n(omission in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39\nL.Ed.2d 662 (1974) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment precludes federal courts from adjudicating suits where\njudgments against the state would be paid with state funds).\n\nSecond, conducting the AJIS checks is not a central government function, but the administration of a County\npolicy. Put differently, the LASD does not act in a law enforcement capacity when administering the County's jail\nrelease policy. The sheriffs have exclusive responsibility for running the county jails. Cal. Gov.Code § 26605. But\nthe counties retain the ultimate authority over the local jails through their fiscal and administrative oversight. Cal.\nGov.Code §§ 23013, 25303. These laws establish that the relationship regarding the administration of the prisons\nsystem is between the counties and the sheriffs, not the state and the sheriffs. There are no provisions in the\nCalifornia Constitution or code that grant the state control over the prisons via the sheriffs. Thus, in the cases at\nhand, the LASD is not performing a central government function for the state when conducting the pre-release\nAJIS checks. Rather, it performs this function at the behest of the County. This conclusion also weighs against\nconsidering the LASD an arm of the state.\nThird, we have found that the LASD is a separately suable entity. As discussed above, in accordance with our\nholdings in Shaw v. California Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 788 F.2d 600, 605 (9th Cir. 1986), and Karim-\nPanahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 839 F.2d 621, 624 n. 2 (9th Cir.1988), a local law enforcement agency can be\nconsidered a separably suable entity. This factor also weighs against the LASD's claim for immunity.\nThe record is bare with respect to the remaining two factors. We therefore find no factors weighing in favor of a\nfinding that the LASD is an arm of the state, especially in view of our extensive analysis of the structure and\nrelationships of the LASD in its operation of the County's jails. Accordingly, we hold that the LASD is not an arm\nof the state of California in its administration of the local county jails. Therefore, we conclude that the district court\ncorrectly rejected the LASD's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's orders denying the LASD's motions to dismiss and the County's\nmotions to dismiss and for summary judgment are AFFIRMED.\n[1] For an in-depth discussion of the LASD's procedure, see Fowler v. Block, 2 F.Supp.2d 1268, 1277-79\n(C.D.Cal.1998),rev'd, 185 F.3d 866 (9th Cir.1999). In Fowler, the district court found that \"in the face of [a] state\ncourt's `clearly established' release order, it was unreasonable for the [Sheriff] to do more than simply `check-out'\nthe Plaintiff after he was returned to custody.\" Id. at 1279. Accordingly, the district court found that AJIS checks\nconducted after a prisoner's release and resulting in overdetention were impermissible and the sheriffs were not\nentitled to qualified immunity. Id. We subsequently reversed and remanded this case on procedural grounds, and\ndid not reach the constitutional issues. \nIn at least one other district court case, a preliminary injunction was issued ordering the LASD to desist in\ndelaying a prisoner's release upon the completion of his or her sentence. See Vanke v. Block, No. 98-4111\n(C.D.Cal. Nov. 7, 1998). In Vanke, the district court found that the delays in the AJIS checks process deprived the\ndetainees of their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.\n[2] One additional appeal was heard on a related matter in Williams v. Block, et al., No. 98-55609. The plaintiff,\nWilliams, appealed the district court's denial of her motion for class certification. We reversed and remanded the\ncase to the district court, but since our ruling, the parties have stipulated to dismiss the case.\n[3] The County moved for dismissal in the Cleaves, et al. v. County of Los Angeles, et al., No. CV-98-09573-WJR;\nGladney v. County of Los Angeles, et al., No. CV-99-00586-WJR; Patchen, et al. v. County of Los Angeles, et al.,\nNo. CV-98-09574-WJR; Shields v. County of Los Angeles, et al., No. CV-98-09695-WJR; and Streit, et al. v.\nCounty of Los Angeles, et al., No. CV-98-09575-WJR.\n[4] The County moved for summary judgment in Williams, et al. v. Block, et al., No. CV-97-03826-WJR.\n[5]See Durning v. Citibank, 950 F.2d 1419, 1423-24 (9th Cir.1991). In Durning, we explained that \"[u]nder the\n`arm of the state' doctrine, a state agent or agency is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment because\n\nthe state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even\nthough individual officials [or state institutions] are nominal defendants.\" Id. (citations omitted).\n[6] The district court granted the County's motions, in part, dismissing the various plaintiffs' Fourteenth\nAmendment claims in each action. In the sixth case, Gladney, the district court reserved ruling pending\narguments on several other motions.\n[7] The district court also ruled upon the County's arguments regarding proximate cause, negligence, Thirteenth\nAmendment claims, and the application of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. These issues are not before us on\nthis appeal.\n[8] Because the district court had reserved its ruling in Gladney, the sixth and final action, pending the outcome of\nother motions, the case was not eligible for certification as part of the consolidated interlocutory appeal.\n[9] Appeal No. 99-56233, White, et al., v. Block, et al., is the County and LASD's consolidated interlocutory\nappeal itself. Although the cases are listed individually as well, the interlocutory appeal is included separately to\nindicate its certification for our review.\n[10] As will be discussed below, we note here that Peters is factually distinguishable from the cases before us\nand therefore would not \"control\" our decision in any event.\n[11] Historically, Alabama county sheriffs were squarely placed under state control to stop them from assisting\nlynch mobs in killing black prisoners. McMillian, 520 U.S. at 788, 117 S.Ct. 1734. No such history has forced\nCalifornia to take control of its county sheriffs through its state constitution. In fact, quite the opposite has been\ntrue in California. In 1970, the California legislature deleted constitutional provisions that gave it the authority to\ndefine the sheriffs' duties, devolving control from the state to the counties. See Beck v. County of Santa Clara,\n204 Cal.App.3d 789, 796, 251 Cal.Rptr. 444, 447 (1988).\n[12] In the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors appoints an interim sheriff to\nhold office until the next countywide election. County of Los Angeles Charter § 16.\n[13] In Pitts, the California Supreme Court applied McMillian to determine \"whether for the purposes of local\ngovernment damages liability, a California district attorney acts on behalf of the state or the county when\npreparing to prosecute and while prosecuting criminal violations of state law, and when establishing policy and\ntraining employees in these areas.\" Pitts, 17 Cal.4th at 345, 70 Cal. Rptr.2d 823, 826, 949 P.2d 920, 923. The \nPitts court held that \"a district attorney acts on behalf of the state when training personnel for and developing\npolicy regarding the preparation for prosecution and prosecution of criminal violations of state law,\" and therefore\nfound the district attorney was not a suable person under section 1983. Id. at 366, 70 Cal.Rptr.2d 823, 839, 949\nP.2d 920, 936. Although Pitts provides some insight into California's application of McMillian, we note that the\ndifferences between the duties and activities of district attorneys and sheriffs are too great to allow Pitts to\ninfluence our decision in the cases on appeal, especially in light of the requisite case-by-case analysis demanded\nby McMillian.\n[14] Again, in County of Lake, the district court exhaustively compiled a list of cases in which \"the Ninth Circuit\nhas considered a California sheriff a local law enforcement agent for purposes of establishing section 1983\nliability under Monell.\" County of Lake, 107 F.Supp.2d at 1148; see id. at 1148 n. 4. They include cases holding\nCalifornia sheriffs liable as local agents decided both before and after McMillian. See, e.g., Headwaters Forest\nDef. v. County of Humboldt, 211 F.3d 1121, 1126 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000); LaLonde v. County of Riverside, 204 F.3d\n947, 961 (9th Cir.2000); Henry v. County of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512, 517-23 (9th Cir.1997); Navarro v. Block, 72\nF.3d 712, 714-15 (9th Cir.1995); Hallstrom v. City of Garden City, 991 F.2d 1473, 1481-82 (9th Cir.1993); Redman\nv. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1447 (9th Cir.1991); Merritt v. County of Los Angeles, 875 F.2d 765,\n770-71 (9th Cir.1989).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This Order encompasses, and fully and finally resolves, all the \n9 \ndamages aspects of the cases listed in Exhibit A. Each was filed as a class action \n10 \nunless there is an indication to the contrary after the case name. The cases listed in \nII \nExhibit A are hereafter collectively referred to as the \"Complaints.\" \n12 \n2.  Plaintiffs are members of one or more of three classes: \n13 \n•  Persons who were purportedly not released from Los Angeles \n14 \nCounty Jail within a reasonable time, as further defined in Exhibit \n15 \nB, after they became entitled to release. \n16 \n•  Persons who were in the custody of law enforcement and taken to \n17 \nCourt, became entitled to release while at the Courthouse, were \n18 \nremanded to the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs \n19 \nDepartment (\"LASD\") and then returned to County Jail, and were \n20 \nsubjected to a purportedly unlawful strip and/or visual body cavity \n21 \nsearch prior to their release. \n22 \n•  Persons who were arrested based on a warrant who were not, in \n23 \nfact, the person for whom the warrant was issued, and were \n24 \npurportedly held without a timely determination of whether slbe \n25 \nwas the correct arrestee, even ifLASD personnel were notified that \n26 \nthe warrant was not for him or her. \n27 \nThe full definition of each class is contained in Exhibit B to this Order. \n28 \n3.

Case 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 6 of 30 .. \n. \n, \n1 \nReleasors on the Released Matters may be of such a character that the full extent \n2  and type of damages sustained by them are not known at this time and further \n3  damages may be sustained by Releasors with respect to the Released Matters. \n4  Releasors may hereafter discover facts different from or in addition to the facts \n5  which Releasors now know or believe to be true with respect to the Released \n6  Matters. This Order shall constitute a full and complete release of the Released \n7  Matters notwithstanding the discovery of any such additional or different facts. \n8  Releasors expressly waive and assume the risk of any and all claims for damages \n9  which exist, have existed in the past or may develop in the future, which Releasors \n10  do not know or suspect to exist, whether through ignorance, oversight, error, \n11 \nnegligence or otherwise, including claims which, if known, could affect Releasors' \n12 \ndecision to settle the Complaints and release the Releasees on the subjects of the \n13 \nReleased Matters. \n14 \n6.  Releasors have been advised of, and have waived the provisions \n15  of Civil Code §1 542, which reads: \n16  \"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH \n17 \nTHE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS \n18 \nFAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF \n19 \nKNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MA TERIALL Y AFFECTED HIS \n20 \nSETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\" \n21 \n7.  The existence, terms and provisions of this Order, and of all \n22 \nother settlement documents, are not and shall not be construed or contended to be \n23 \nan admission by any of the Defendants of either the validity of any of the claims \n24 \nasserted in any of the Complaints, or of any of their liability for any claim of any \n25 \nwrongdoing whatsoever. Any statements or arguments made on behalf of any \n26 \nPlaintiff or any Defendant in connection with, or at the settlement hearing on, or in \n27 \nsupport of the settlement, shall not be used as evidence or otherwise in any way in \n28 \nany subsequent trial, proceeding or hearing either in this action or in any other \naction or proceeding between all or any of the parties, should such occur. \n4 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 7 of 30\n. \n: \nI \n8.  Any Plaintiff, including any Named Plaintiff, who has not opted \n2  out of this settlement by filing an opt-out fonn in accordance with the tenns set \n3  forth in the Class Notice is deemed to have released the Releasees in accordance \n4  with the tenns of this Order, and is bound by it. The list of persons who have opted \n5  out of this settlement is contained in Exhibit D. \n6  9.  This settlement and the Orders effectuating it involve a \n7  compromise of disputed claims. Neither the Orders nor the payment of any money \n8  by any Defendant is ever to be deemed or contended or construed in any manner \n9  whatsoever as an admission of any of the allegations of wrongful conduct, claims \n10  or liability on the part of any of the Defendants, by whom such allegations and \nII \nliability are expressly denied and contested. \n12 \n10.  The order of Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, entered on March 10, \n13 \n1999, granting partial summary judgment to Plaintiffs in Tchakmakjian, et al. v. \n14 \nCounty ofL  os Angeles, et al., Case No. CV -98-9683-MRP, on the issue of whether \n15 \nthe policy and practice of subjecting Court returnees entitled to immediate release \n16 \nto strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to release violates any person's \n17 \nconstitutional or civil rights is hereby vacated. That Order is deemed null and void, \n18 \nand may not be cited by any party on the basis of the doctrines of res judicata or \n19 \ncollateral estoppel, or for any other reason. Judge Pfaelzer is aware of and has no \n20 \nobjection to the entry of this provision of this Order. \n21 \n11.  The Class Distribution shall be made according to the terms and \n22 \nstandards contained further on in this Order, a detennination that shall be made by \n23 \nthe Class Administrator, who may confer with counsel for either Plaintiffs or \n24 \nDefendants as he sees fit. With the exception of the foregoing, the Class \n25 \nAdministrator shall be solely responsible for the allocation and distribution of the \n26 \nproceeds of the settlement funds to Plaintiffs in accordance with this Order. Except \n27 \nfor the deposits into the Class Fund as required by this Order, the Defendants will \n28 \nhave no further obligations or duties or liability whatsoever with respect to the \nClass Fund. \n5 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 8 of 30\n12.  In agreeing to the entry of the Orders, the Court finds that \n2  Plaintiffs have relied wholly on their judgment, belief and knowledge of the nature, \n3  extent and duration of the alleged damages and injuries, and have not been \n4  influenced to any extent by any representations or statements regarding alleged \n5  damages or injuries or regarding any other matter made by Defendants or by any \n6  persons employed by, retained by or representing the Defendants, which are not \n7  contained in the Orders. \n8 \n13.  Plaintiffs have been represented by Class Counsel throughout \n9  all negotiations which preceded the Orders. \n10  14.  In accepting money under this Settlement, the Plaintiffs have \n1I  \nrepresented and warranted to the Defendants that they have not assigned, \n12  transferred or purported to assign or transfer any claim, demand, action, cause of \n13  action or right herein released or discharged. If any Plaintiffhas made such a \n14  transfer or assignment, the Orders apply to such transferee or assignee. \n15  15.  This Order, the previously filed Stipulated Settlement \n16 \nAgreement, and the Exhibits and documents attached to or referenced in them, \n17 \ncontain the entire agreement and understanding concerning the Settlement and \n18 \nRelease of All Claims between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. They supersede \n19 \nand replace all prior negotiations and any proposed agreement and agreements, \n20 \nwritten and oral. The Court finds that no Defendant, or agent or attorney of any \n21 \nDefendant, has made any promise, representation or warranty whatsoever, express \n22 \nor implied, not contained in the documents referred to in this paragraph to induce \n23 \nPlaintiffs to agree to the Settlement and Release of All Claims. The Court further \n24 \nfinds that Plaintiffs have not agreed to the terms of this settlement in reliance upon \n25 \nany promise, representation or warranty not contained in the documents referred to \n26 \nin this paragraph. \n27 \n16.  Plaintiffs and/or Class Counsel shall not individually or \n28 \ncollectively institute, instigate, bring, commence or continue any additional actions \nat law or in equity, or any civil or other proceeding in any Court of the United \n6 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 9 of 30\nStates, any State thereof, or any other body, administrative or otherwise, against \n2  any the Releasees for any claim which is discharged by this Order. \n3  17.  The terms, conditions, and provisions ofthis and prior Orders \n4  of this Court in connection with this settlement shall be binding upon, and shall \n5  inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. \n6  18.  Plaintiffs have not relied upon the advice ofReleasees as to the \n7  legal and/or tax consequences of this settlement, the payment of any money by the \n8 \nDefendants or the distribution of the Class Fund. Releasors hereby release and \n9 \ndischarge the Releasees from any and all present and future actions, causes of \n10 \naction, claims, demands, rights, debts, damages, costs, expenses, sums of money, \n11 \nlosses, compensation, controversies, accountings, reckonings, liens, damages, \n12 \ncosts, losses, expenses, compensation and suits of any kind or of any nature \n13 \nwhatsoever by reason of the legal or tax consequences of the Orders, the payment \n14 \nof any money by the Defendants, and the distribution of the Class Fund. \n15 \n19.  Appropriate notice has been given to the classes, as previously \n16 \nordered by the Court, and as detailed in the Report of the Class Administrator filed \n17 \nwith the Court. The Court was notified that the published notice was run two times \n18 \nrather than the three times contained in the Court's earlier Order, and the Court has \n19 \npreviously approved this change orally, and does so now through this Order. \n20 \n20.  The terms of the settlement as embodied herein are adequate, \n21 \nfair, just, reasonable and equitable, and it is in the best interest of the classes that \n22 \nthis settlement be approved as set forth herein. The Court has reviewed and \n23 \nconsidered the objections that have been filed to this proposed settlement. The \n24 \nCourt notes that none of the objections have gone beyond a general statement of \n25 \nopposition, without explanation or clarification of the specific reasons for \n26 \nobjection, or citation to any legal authority that would provide support for the \n27 \nobjection. The Court considers the settlement one that is very favorable to the \n28 \nclasses, and concludes that none of the objections are meritorious. See also Order \n7 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 10 of 30\nre Award of Attorneys' Fees for a discussion ofthe factors affecting the possible \n2  risks to the classes if this settlement were not approved. \n3  21.  The Court approves the settlement as it is embodied in this \n4  Order. In the last paragraph of this Order, the Court addresses the requirements of \n5  F. R. Civ. P. Rule 23, and concludes that they have been met and that this matter \n6  has been appropriately certified as a class action. \n7  22.  Defendants shall pay a total of $21 ,500,000 into a Class Fund. \n8 \n23.  The Court approves the Named Plaintiffs Distribution - a total \n9 \nof $737,000 (exclusive of fees). The Court concludes that this award is justified \n10  because the Named Plaintiffs made contributions to the class as a whole, justifying \n11  awards to them higher than those to the general class. In addition, the Named \n12 \nPlaintiffs' individualized damages claims, including special damages, are a factor \n13  in the determination of the sum they receive. Any fees due Class Counsel for their \n14  representation of the Named Plaintiffs is encompassed within the Class Fund \n15 \nAttorney's Fees referenced in \n~25. \n16 \n24.  The Court approves the payments made to date to the Class \n17 \nAdministrator for its efforts in distributing the Class Notice, and administering and \n18 \nprocessing the Plaintiffs' Claim Forms, and the related activities in which it has \n19 \nengaged or will engage, which amounts to $384,224.99. The Court also approves \n20 \nthe payment of an additional $273,123.08 for work performed by the Class \n21 \nAdministrator through October 9,2002. The Court also approves the payment to \n22 \nthe University of California at Los Angeles of $5,380 for class administration \n23 \nexpenses. Further, the Court approves additional payment of up to $182,652 to the \n24 \nClass Administrator, which is his estimate of the high end of the additional costs \n25 \nentailed in completing the claims administration process. The combined total \n26 \nprojected costs for Class Administration thus come to $845,380.07 or less, which is \n27 \nreasonably consistent with the estimate received from the Class Administrator to \n28 \nprocess the number of claims that have been filed here. Any of that sum not used \nwill be placed into the Cy Pres Fund. A final accounting of the Class \n8 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 11 of 30\n.. \nAdministrator's bill shall be provided to the Court, as part of the final accounting \n2  for the case, and shall be filed no later than 30 days after completion of the mailing \n3  of the checks to the Plaintiffs. \n4  25.  Class Counsel are awarded 20 % of the Class Fund after \n5  payment of the costs of Class Administration (after addition of interest and \n6  subtraction of Class Administrative and Counsel Costs), plus costs of$34,743, in \n7  Class Fund Attorneys' Fees and Costs, to be paid equally from Distributions 3 and \n8  4. (Distributions 1-4 are described in ~27 below.) This comes to a total of \n9  $4,184,000, plus $34,743, or a combined total of$4,218,743, to be paid in two \n10  equal installments. The basis for the Court's award is contained in a separate order. \n11  To the extent there is any conflict between this paragraph and the separate fee \n12  order, the separate fee order controls. \n13  26.  All funds due under this settlement shall be paid into a special \n14  trust or class settlement account established by the Administrator, or a temporary \n15  special County account, and shall be distributed from there pursuant to the terms of \n16 \nthis Order. Interest earned from any such accounts through October 28, 2002, is \n17 \npart of the Class Fund, and will be allocated accordingly. Interest earned after \n18 \nOctober 28, 2002, shall go to the Cy Pres Fund. In the event of an appeal that lasts \n19 \nlonger than six months from October 28, 2002, before final resolution, the Court \n20 \nwill consider then whether to modify the allocation of the accrued interest. \n21 \n27.  The Defendants will make payments as indicated below, which \n22 \nin some cases have already been made. Those funds shall be paid into a special \n23 \ninterest bearing account as described in  supra. The payments shall be, or have \n~26, \n24 \nbeen, made on the following terms and schedule: \n25 \na)  $500,000 to fund Class administration as needed (Distribution 1). This \n26 \nhas already been placed in a special County fund, and interest is \n27 \ndeemed to accrue into the Class Fund from that date on those funds \n28 \nnot paid out. \nb)  $9,000,000 was due on September I, 200 I, but was not paid due to \n9 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 12 of 30\nthe delay in processing the class claims. This has already been placed \n2  in a special County fund, and interest is deemed to accrue into the \n3  Class Fund from that date on those funds, as provided in  above. \n~26 \n4  (Distribution 2) \n5  c)  $9,000,000 was due on September 1,2002. This has already been \n6  placed in a special County fund, and interest is deemed to accrue into \n7  the Class Fund from that date on those funds as provided in \n~26 \n8 \nabove.  Of this payment, one-half (1/2) of the Class Fund Attorneys' \n9 \nFees and Costs awarded by the Court due Class Counsel will be paid, \n10 \nand the remainder will be distributed to the Cy Pres Fund described in \n11 \ninfra. (Distribution 3) \n~[30, \n12 \nd)  $3,000,000 is due September 1,2003. Of this payment, one-half (112) \n13 \nof the Class Fund Attorneys' Fees and Costs awarded by the Court \n14 \ndue Class Counsel will be paid, and the remainder will be distributed \n15 \nto the Cy Pres Fund described in  infra. (Distribution 4) \n~30, \n16 \ne)  The foregoing sums amount to $21,500,000 plus accrued interest of \n17 \n$300,000. As noted previously in  a total of up to $845,380.07 has \n~24, \n18 \nbeen authorized or set aside for class administrative expenses. As of \n19 \nOctober 2, 2002, the accrued interest has amounted to approximately \n20 \n$300,000.  $737,000 is allocated to the Named Plaintiffs' Distribution. \n21 \nIt will be distributed according to the agreements between Class \n22 \nCounsel and the Named Plaintiffs. (No separate attorneys' fees or \n23 \ncosts will be taken from this distribution; rather any fees from this \n24 \nwork are incorporated into the Court's order regarding the Motion for \n25 \nan Attorneys' Fee Award.) $13,399,000 shall be reserved for \n26 \ndistribution by the Class Administrator to Plaintiffs based on the \n27 \nstandards contained in  28-32, infra. This figure was determined by \n~~ \n28 \nthe difference between the total of 1) the maximum class \nadministration costs of $845,380.07 and Class Counsel costs of \n1Q \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 13 of 30\n$34,743 (rounded off to a total of $880,000); 2) the Class Fund \n2  Attorneys' Fees of$4, 184,000; 3) the Named Plaintiffs award of \n3  $737,000; 4) and the Cy Pres Fund of$2,600,0001, on the one hand, \n4  and the $21,500,000 Class Fund plus accrued interest on the other. \n5  See Order re Attorney's Fees for a chart presentation of the allocation \n6  of the total Class Fund. As described above and summarized here, \n7  one-half(1I2) of the Class Fund Attorneys' Fees and costs awarded by \n8 \nthe Court due Class Counsel will be paid from Distribution 3, and \n9 \none-half will be paid from Distribution 4. In each period, the balance \n10  (after paying all class claimants) will go to the Cy Pres Fund \nII \ndescribed in  30, infra. \n~ \n12 \n28.  Based upon the point system distribution formula hereby \n13 \napproved by the Court, the Administrator shall make a determination of the claim \n14  of each Plaintiff, based upon the definitions contained in Exhibit B, as follows. \n15 \n•  Overdetentions: Day 1 or any part thereof of overdetention '\" 1 \n16 \npoint total; Days 2-3 = 2 points total; Days 4-5 = 3 points total; \n17 \nDays 6-7 '\" 4 points total; Over one week'\" 5 points total. \n18 \n•  Body cavity search: One strip/visual body cavity search = 3 points. \n19 \nEach subsequent strip/visual body cavity search = 2 points. \n20 \n•  Wrong warrant: One wrong warrant = 2 points. \n21 \n29.  Except for the strip/visual body cavity search points, each \n22 \nPlaintiffs points are to be based upon information obtained from the LASD's \n23 \ncomputerized records, and no other source. The total points will be divided into the \n24 \navailable funds, so that a value per point is detezmined. Each Plaintiff will receive \n25 \nthe value of his or her points. \n26 \n27 \n1 See ~31, which discusses how the size of Cy Pres Fund was determined. As that paragraph \n28  notes, it is not known for certain what the final number of points will be, and the figure given \nhere is thus an estimate, but it is an estimate on the high side. Should the final number of points \nchange the amount to go to the Cy Pres Fund under the provisions of~31. that calculation will \nprevail, and the figures contained herein will be adjusted accordingly. \n11 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 14 of 30\n30.  Of the $21,500,000 Class Fund due to the classes under this \n2  Order, a portion, as further defined in this paragraph and ~31 infra, will be placed \n3  in a Cy Pres Fund as an allocation for absent class members. This fund will be \n4  allocated in Distributions 3 and 4. The Cy Pres Distribution will be used to fund \n5  costs to monitor policy changes adopted by the LASD to eliminate problems \n6  relating to over-detentions, striplbody cavity searches and wrong warrants, and to \n7  fund programs serving the population at risk of incarceration in the Los Angeles \n8  County Jail. The Cy Pres Fund will first pay monitoring costs, specifically to pay \n9  Class Counsel to monitor the implementation ofthe' policy changes adopted by \n10  LASD. The parties shall maintain a reserve in the Cy Pres Fund of $1 00,000 until \nI 1 \nSeptember I, 2003, or the time that this settlement becomes final, whichever is \n12  later, to pay any claims that are determined to have been timely filed but not \n13  received and/or appropriately processed by the Class Administrator through that \n14  date. Lead Class Counsel Barry Litt and John Burton will fulfill this task, with \n15  Class Counsel Robert Mann as back up. Compensation will be at their then current \n16  hourly rates. Two-thirds (2/3) of the remaining Cy Pres Distribution shall go to \n17 \nLASD Inmate programs and one-third (1/3) shall go to community based \n18 \norganizations serving populations at risk of incarceration, to be mutually agreed to \n19 \nby Class Counsel and the Los Angeles County Sheriff through a process to be \n20 \nagreed upon between them, and with the approval of the Los Angeles County \n21 \nBoard of Supervisors. However, the Cy Pres Fund shall not be distributed until all \n22 \nPlaintiffs who are due funds under this settlement have been paid or the funds \n23 \nreserved. All Class Fund claims for which checks are written, sent and not cashed \n24 \nwithin six months ofthe date the check was issued shall revert from the individual \n25 \nclaimant and be added to the Cy Pres Fund. \n26 \n31.  The parties previously stipulated that, if the total points were \n27 \n60,000 or less, then the Cy Pres Fund would be $3,000,000. Various point \n28 \nincreases thereafter would reduce the Cy Pres Fund in $100,000 increments, but in \nno event would it go below $2,000,000. The progression was as follows: \n12 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 15 of 30\n•  60,001-70,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,900,000 \n2  •  70,001-80,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,800,000 \n3 \n•  80,001-90,000 points  Cy Pres Distribution of $2,700,000 \n= \n4 \n•  90,001-110,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,600,000 \n5 \n•  110,001-130,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,500,000 \n6 \n•  130,001-150,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,400,000 \n7 \n•  150,001-170,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,300,000 \n8 \n•  170,001-190,000 points = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,200,000 \n9 \n•  190,001-210,000 points or more = Cy Pres Distribution of \n10 \n$2,100,000 \nI I \n•  210,001 points or more = Cy Pres Distribution of $2,000,000 \n12 \nBased on the Report of the Class Administrator, the total number of points \n13 \n14  attributed to the Class Claimants is estimated to range from approximately 99,000 \n15  to  108,000, which would set the amount of the Cy Pres Fund as  $2,600,000. It is \n16  not known for certain what the final number of points will be. Should the final \n17  number of points change the amount to go to the Cy Pres Fund under the \n18  provisions of this paragraph, that calculation will prevail, and the figures contained \n19  in ~27( d) will be adjusted accordingly. \n20  32.  The parties previously stipulated that, despite the earlier \n21  provisions of this Order, no Plaintiff not listed in Exhibit C could receive more \n° \n22  than 1  points, or receive more than $5,000, under this Order, even if sibe would \n23  otherwise be entitled to do so under the standards contained above. Further, they \n24  agreed that no Plaintiff could receive less than $50, even if sibe would not be \n25  entitled to receive that amount under the standards contained above, except in the \n26  event that the number of claimants was so large that there was not sufficient funds \n27  in the Class Distribution to pay each claimant $50, in which case the amount would \n28  be reduced pro rata. Based on the report of the Class Administrator, no Plaintiff \n13 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 16 of 30\n1  would receive less than $50 nor more than $5,000 based upon application of the \n2  formula contained in this Order, and thus no adjustments are required. \n3  33.  The Class Administrator is Rosenthal & Co., a firm specializing \n4  in processing class actions, which has previously been appointed by this Court. \n5  The Administrator shall scale the claims based upon the point system described in \n6  ~28. It shall compute the number of points due to each Plaintiff, and divide each \n7  Plaintiff s number of points into the total number of points to determine each \n8  Plaintiffs proportionate share of the Class Distribution. \n9 \n34.  The period in which to file a class claim terminated on \n10  September 20, 2002 (except in the case of people who had outstanding inquiries, \n11  who were allowed an additional two weeks in which to file claims pursuant to \n12  verbal authority granted by this Court). Any claim filed after those dates shall be \n13  void regardless of whether the Plaintiff otherwise qualifies as a class member. No \n14  exceptions shall be considered. \n15 \n35.  All Distributions called for under this Order shall be paid into \n16 \nthe Class Fund on the dates set out in  of this Order shall be allocated based \n~27 \n17 \nupon the allocation system contained in  of this Order, but shall be actually \n~~28-32 \n18 \ndistributed only as provided in  of this Order. \n~36 \n19 \n36.  There have been a combined total of five (5) objections to the \n20 \nsettlement and/or the Motion for an award of attorneys' fees filed. All such \n21 \nobjections have been filed in pro persona (i.e., no objectors are represented by \n22 \ncounsel).  No funds shall be distributed until the time for appeal has run on any \n23 \nobjections to this settlement and no appeal has been filed, or an appeal has been \n24 \nfiled and finally disposed of. During the intervening period, the funds shall be \n25 \nmaintained in a special interest bearing account as described in  supra. \n~26, \n26 \nHowever, if the appeal would only affect a portion of the Class Fund, or would \n27 \nonly affect the award of attorneys' fees and costs and not the Class Distribution, or \n28 \nwould only affect a portion of the attorneys' fees and costs awarded, then the \nunaffected portion shall be distributed, as shall any Class Fund Attorneys' Fees \n14 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 17 of 30\nawarded for the unaffected part. The Court has addressed the objections generally \n2  in ~20, supra, and addresses each of the objections separately in a separate Order. \n3  37.  Except as otherwise provided in this Order, each party shall \n4  bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. \n5  38.  The use of the masculine gender herein is construed to include \n6  the feminine and/or the neuter where applicable. The use of the singular herein is \n7  to be construed to include the plural where applicable. The use of the plural herein \n8  shall be construed to include the singular where applicable. \n9 \n39.  The Court reserves and maintains jurisdiction over this \n10  settlement, and over the claims administration and distribution of the funds. \n11 \nDisagreements between the parties on any disputes or unresolved aspects of this \n12 \nOrder shall be subject to mediation before the mediator who has mediated this case \n13 \nto date. If mediation is not successful, the matter shall be brought to this Court for \n14  resolution. \n15 \n40.  The Class Administrator shall process all claims within 60 days \n16  ofthe time monies may be distributed to Plaintiffs under the provisions of~36 of \n17  this Order, and shall file a final report within 60 days thereafter regarding the Class \n18 \nDistribution for which it is responsible under this Order. Class Counsel shaU file a \n19 \nfinal report on all distributions under this Order no later than February 1, 2004, or \n20 \nat the time that the Class Administrator files his final report, whichever is later. \n21 \n41.  When this, or any subsequent, Order of the Court becomes \n22 \nfinal, an Order of Dismissal of the Complaints, including in this case, shall be \n23 \nentered in each of the cases (except for the Riley case, which is already scheduled \n24 \nfor final dismissal once this case is resolved. Pursuant to the provisions  the \nof~39, \n25 \nCourt retains jurisdiction over matters related to the settlement.) \n26 \n42.  The court previously certified these classes pursuant to the \n27 \nagreement of the parties, but did not independently address the requirements ofF. \n28 \nR. Civ. P. Rule 23, which it now addresses. The court finds that all requirements of \nF. R. Civ. P. Rule 23 have been met in this case for each class certified, and that \n15 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 18 of 30\n1  the case is appropriately certified as a class action. Each consideration under F. R. \n2  Civ. P. Rule 23 is discussed in tum below: \n3  A.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \n4  impracticable. Over 250,000 notices were mailed to class \n5  members, and over 40,000 claims were made. F. R. Civ. P. \n6  Rule 23(a)(l). \n7 \nB.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, to wit, \n8  whether, pursuant to a policy of the LASD, class members were \n9  overdetained, were strip and/or visually body cavity searched \n10 \nafter being entitled to release, and/or were detained on a wrong \n11 \nwarrant. F. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a)(2). \n12 \nC.  The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims \n13 \nof the classes. The named class members included several \n14 \npeople claiming they were overdetained, several claiming they \n15 \nwere strip and/or visually body cavity searched after becoming \n16 \nentitled to release, and several claiming they were detained on a \n17 \nwrong warrant. Information was presented indicating that these \n18 \nclaims were typical of the class. Further, on the overdetention \n19 \nissue, the Ninth Circuit determined that the District Court's \n20 \ninitial finding of lack of typicality was wrong as a matter of \n21 \nlaw. F. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a)(3). \n22 \nD.  The representative parties have fairly and adequately protected \n23 \nthe interests of the class, as this settlement, and the large \n24 \nnumbers of class claims, indicate. F. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a)(4). \n25 \nE.  Further, the Court finds that \"the questions oflaw or fact \n26 \ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any \n27 \nquestions affecting only individual members, and that a class \n28 \naction is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy.\" F. R. Civ. P. Rule \n16 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 71      Filed 11/27/2002     Page 19 of 30\n. \n\\ \n23(b )(3). In addition, the Court concludes that (A) the interests \n2  of the class are best served by aggregation of the action rather \n3  than individual prosecution of the claims which, as a practical \n4  matter, would preclude the vast majority of class members from \n5  realizing any remedy at all; (B) these matters have consistently \n6  been litigated as class actions by the Named Plaintiffs, based \n7  upon the conclusion of the class representatives and their \n8  counsel that this was the best means of obtaining relief; (C) the \n9 \nmost desirable and efficient means of resolving the issues is in \n10 \nthe form of a class action; and CD) the class was manageable, \n11 \ninvolving people who could be reasonably determined from the \n12 \nLASD's own data, and regarding the resolution of whose \n13 \nclaims few difficulties were expected to be or were encountered \n14 \nbeyond the sheer management of the numbers involved. \n15 \n~'rr\\.~~ \n16  DATED:  N~j7)c9,~ \n17  Carla M.

MOTION  TO  DISMISS \n11 \nCOUNTY  OF  LOS  ANGELES,  et  al., \n12 \nDefendants. \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16  This  matter  comes  before  the  Court  on  Defendant  Estate  of \n17  Sherman  Block's Motion  to  Dismiss.  As  a  preliminary matter, \n18  Defendant  Estate  of  Sherman  Block  (MDefendant  Estate\")  argues  that \n19  Plaintiffs'  Opposition  was  not  timely  filed,  and  therefore  the \n20  Motion  should be  decided  on  Defendant  Estate's moving  papers  alone. \n21  Substantively,  Defendant  Estate  asserts  (1)  that  Plaintiffs'  claims \n22  are  barred by  the  statute  of  limitations,  and  (2)  that  any  ruling \n23  against  it would  be  merely  an  advisory  opinion. \n24  The  Court  has  fully  considered  the  briefs  and  authorities \n25  pertaining  to  this  matter,  and  the  Court  finds  the Motion \n26  appropriate  for  decision  without  oral  argument.  See  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n27  Local  Rule  7.11 .  Therefore,  the  Court  rules  as  follows: \n~8; \n. '  .'  -I. .....' :\"~~ \n., l/ \n28 \n[jOCKETED \n~(,~ MlD   COpy PTYS \n...r :'.  YLD NOnCE PTYS \n..r:  .. , \nJS-6·  ' \n\nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 55      Filed 07/12/1999     Page 2 of 5\n1  I.  Timeliness  of Plaintiffs'  Opposition \n2  Local  Rule  7.6  states  that  opposing  papers  are  to  be  filed no \n3  later  than  fourteen  days  before  the  scheduled  hearing  of  the  motion. \n4  Defendant  Estate  argues  that  because  Plaintiffs'  papers  were  filed \n5  one  day  late,  they  should  be  rejected and  the Motion  should be \n6  decided  on  Defendant  Estate's moving  papers  alone. \n7  However,  Plaintiffs'  one-day  late  filing  appears  to  be  an \n8  isolated  incident.  Plaintiffs  have  not  demonstrated  a  pattern or \n9  practice  of  violating  local  rules.  Accordingly,  the  Court  in \n10  exercising  its  sound  discretion  over  the  matter  finds  it appropriate \n11  to  consider  Plaintiffs'  Opposition. \n12 \n13  II.  statute of  Limitations \n14  Defendant  Estate  argues  that  Plaintiffs'  actions  are  barred \n15  because  they were  not  filed  within  California's  one  year  statute of \n16  limitations  for  claims  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  Defendant  Estate \n17  relies  on  Del  Percio  v.  Thornsley,  877  F.2d  785,  786  (9th  Cir. \n18  1989),  to  support  this  argument.  In  Del  Percio,  the  court  held  that \n19  California's  one  year  personal  injury  statute of  limitations,  as \n20  outlined  in  California  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  §  340(3),  applies  to \n21  actions  brought  in  California  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  rd.  at \n22  786.  However,  since  it is  a  state statute  of  limitations  that \n23  applies  to  §  1983  causes  of  action,  the  Court  must  consider  any \n24  state  statutes  that  toll or  extend  the  applicable  statute  of \n25  limitations.  See  Johnson  v.  Railway  Express  Agency,  421  U.S.  454, \n26  464  (1975)  (stating  that  because  statutes  of  limitations  are \n27  interrelated with  provisions  and  questions  of  application,  courts \n28  should  consider  both  the  state statute  and  any  state  exceptions  when \n2 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 55      Filed 07/12/1999     Page 3 of 5\n1  applying  state  statutes  of  limitations  to  federal  cases). \n2  Under  California  law,  there  are  instances  where  the  general \n3  statute of  limitations  does  not  apply.  For  example,  the  California \n4  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  provides: \n5  (a)  If a  person  against  whom  an  action  may  be  brought  on  a \nliability of  the  person,  whether  arising  in  contract,  tort,  or \n6  otherwise,  and  whether  accrued  or  not  accrued,  dies before  the \nexpiration  of  the  applicable  limitations period,  and  the  cause \n7  of action  survives,  an  action may  be  commenced  within  one  year \nafter  the  date  of death,  and  the  limitations period  that  would \n8  have  been  applicable  does  not  apply. \n9  Cal.  Civ.  Proc.  Code  366.2  (emphasis  added) . \n§ \n10  In  the  case  at  bar,  the  Plaintiffs'  causes  of  action  commenced \n11  in  December  of  1997  and  April  and  May  of  1998. Defendant  Estate \n' \n12  was  named  as  a  Defendant  on  May  12,  1999,  over  one  year  later. \n13  However,  Sheriff  Block  died  November  1,  1998.  Therefore,  under \n14  §  366.2,  the  statute  of  limitations  for  Plaintiffs'  causes  action \n15  against  Block  would  not  run  from  the  date  of  the  commencement  of  the \n16  causes  of  action,  but  from  the  date  of  Block's  death.  Accordingly, \n17  Plaintiffs  had  one  year  from  the  date  of  his  death  to  file  the \n18  action.  Because  Plaintiffs  filed  their  claims  within  the  one  year \n19  statute  of  limitations  as  set  forth  in  §  366.2,  the  Court  rejects \n20  Defendant  Estate's  argument  that  Plaintiffs'  claims  are  time  barred. \n21 \n22  III.  Advisory Opinion \n23  Defendant  Estate  argues  that  Plaintiffs'  claims  are  barred by \n24  the  \"cases  and  controversies\"  requirement  of Article  III  of'the U.S. \n25  Constitution.  Specifically,  Defendant  Estate  argues  that  since  no \n26  additional  damages  could be  obtained  from  its presence  in  the  suit, \n27 \n'Plaintiffs  Streit,  Santillana,  and  Roerich,  were  released  from \n28  custody on  May  6,  1998,  December  8,  1997,  April  19,  1998  respectively. \n3 \n\n. \n'.  Case 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 55      Filed 07/12/1999     Page 4 of 5\n... \n1  any  judgment  against  it would  be  merely  advisory.  Defendant  Estate \n2  relies  on  Sanchez  v.  City of  Riverside,  596  F.  Supp.  193  (C.D.  Cal. \n3  1984),  in  asserting  this  proposition. \n4  However,  Sanchez  is  not  on  point.  Sanchez  was  a  bifurcated \n5  trial where  claims  against  the  police  officers proceeded before \n6  claims  against  the  City.  In  Sanchez,  the  plaintiff alleged  no \n7  separate  wrong  against  the  City  that  was  not  alleged  against  an \n8  officer.  Id.  at  194-195.  When  the  case  against  the  officers was \n9  completed,  and  judgment  rendered  in  favor  of  the  plaintiff,  the  City \n10  acknowledged  its obligation  to  pay  compensatory  damages  awarded  to \n11  the  plaintiff because  it was  the  officers'  employer.  Therefore, \n12  since  the  plaintiff was  fully  compensated  and  could  receive  no  other \n13  damages,  the  court  found  there  was  no  reason  to  continue  litigation \n14  against  the  City.  Moreover,  the  court  found  that  any  judgment \n15  against  the  City  would  result  in  an  advisory  opinion.  Id.  at  195. \n16  The  City  in  Sanchez  is  not  analogous  to  Defendant  Estate  in  the \n17  instant  case.  Unlike  the  allegations  in  Sanchez,  the  actions \n18  alleged  against  Defendant  Estate  are  separate  from  those  of  Block's \n19  employees.  Defendant  Estate  is being  sued  for  Block's  personal \n20  actions.  Accordingly,  Defendant  Estate  cannot  be  excused  from \n21  defending  allegations  regarding  Block's  personal  actions,  regardless \n22  of  who  may  ultimately pay  damages. \n23  In  addition,  Defendant  Estate's  argument--that  Plaintiffs  will \n24  be  fully  compensated  without  Defendant  Estate  as  a  party--is  faulty. \n25  The  City  in Sanchez  was  dismissed  after  it was  evident  that  the \n26  plaintiff was  fully  compensated  by  the  judgment  in  the  first  part of \n27  the  bifurcated  trial.  Id.  at  195.  Here,  Plaintiffs  have  yet  to  be \n28  compensated.  Further,  because  compensatory  damages  may  be  available \n4 \n\nCase 2:98-cv-09575-CW     Document 55      Filed 07/12/1999     Page 5 of 5\n1  against  Defendant  Estate  for  Sheriff Block's  personal  actions, \n2  Plaintiffs may  not  be  fully  compensated  without  Defendant  Estate  as \n3  a  party.2 \n4  Thus,  the  Court  rejects  Defendant  Estate's  argument  that \n5  proceeding  with  the  claims  against  Defendant  Estate  would  result  in \n6  an  improper  advisory  opinion  and  would  waste  judicial  resources. \n7  Accordingly,  the  Court  DENIES  Defendant  Estate's Motion  to \n8  Dismiss. \n9 \n10 \n11  IT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \nJUlY~, \n12  Dated:  1999 \n13 \n14 \nWILLIAM  J.  REA \n15  United  States  District  Judge \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27  Since  compensatory  damages  may  be  available  against  Defendant \n2 \nEstate,  the  Court  at  this  time  need  not  address  the  parties'  arguments \n28  over  whether  punitive  damages  are  recoverable  against  Defendant  Estate. \n5 ",
