(\"FTCA\"). Assistant Chief Counset for DHS denied\nMs. Tungwararaโs claims in a letter dated March 4, 2004.\nVENUE\nVenue is proper in .th~..e. Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n5 ยง 1391.\n6 INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT\n7 4. Plaintiffโs claims arose in the county of San Francisco. Therefore, assignment to\n8 the San Francisco or Oakland Division of this Court is proper under Local Rule 3-2(d).\n9 THE PARTIES\n10 5. PlaintiffTsungai Tungwarara is a citizen of Zimbabwe. She was granted\n11 derivative asylum status in the United States in 2003 in connection with the asylum application of\n12 her mother, Faith Virimayi, who was granted asylum status in 2002. Ms~ Virimayi was granted\n13 asylum status after being interviewed by an INS Asylum Officer and found to be credible and to\n14 have a well-founded fear of persecution in Zimbabwe.\n15 6. At all relevant times herein, Defendant Alfert Ludwigs (\"Ludwigs) was an agent\n16 and/or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States of America\n17 (\"INS\") and is sued in his individual capacity. Defendant was the officer-in-charge of the stop,\n18 detention, arrest, search and/or seizure of Plaintiff that is described herein. Plaintiff is informed\n19 and believes and thereon alleges that Ludwigs is a resident of the Northern District of California.\n2O 7. Defendant United States of America exists under the Constitution of the United\n2I States of America and taws enacted by the United States Congress. The INS was at all times\n22 mentioned herein an agency o f the United States Department of Justic e, organized and exi sting\n23 under the laws of the United States. The United States is vicariously liable for the misconduct of\n24 its agents and employees and is directly liable for any policies of the United States or its agencies\n25 leading to or contributing to such misconduct, including but not limited to failure to supervise\n26 employees properly, failure to train employees properly, and failure to implement sufficient\n27 procedures to guard against the type of misconduct that occurred in this case.\n28 8. At all relevant times herein, defendants DOES 1-25 (also referred to hereinafter as\n- 2 - 17804\\700576.2\nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n\n1 the \"DOE defendants\"), each of whom Plaintiffsues in their individual capacities, were agents,\n2 employees, and/or otherwise representatives of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the\n3 United States Department of State, other federal agencies, state agencies, local government\n4 agencies, and/or private .actoys actin,..g, in their individual capacities. Plaintiffis informed and\n5 believes and thdโeon alleges that many, if not all, of DOES 1-25 are residents of the Northern\n6 District of California. Plaintiff and/or her represeniatives have undertaken reasonable and\n7 diligent efforts to ascertain the true identities of DOES 1-25, but, despite such efforts, Plaintiff is\n8 presently unaware of the true identities of defendants DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and Plaintiff..\n9 therefore, sues each such.defendant by a fictitious name. Ms. Tungwarara is informed and\n10 believes and thereon alleges that DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, are legally responsible for the\n11 wrongs committed against Plaintiff, as alleged herein, and that many, if not all, of DOES 1-25,\n12 had supervisoriat and/or managerial responsibility over Ludwigs and exercised, or failed to\n13 exercise, that authority in Ludwigsโ dealings with Plaintiff, in a manner which caused the harms\n14 herein alleged, or otherwise proximately caused the harms herein alleged in derogation of their\n15 duties to Ms. Tungwarara. When Plaintiff becomes aware of the true identities of one or more\ni 16 DOE defendants, Plaintiffwill amend her complaint to add or substitute them as named\nโ 17 defendants.\n~ 18 FACTS GIVING RISE TO CLAIMS\n19 9. The incident on which Ms. Tungwararaโs claims are based began on or about\n20 January 9, 2002, when Ms. Tungwarara, an 18 year-old woman taking her first trip to the United\nI\n1 21 States, arrived at San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\") following a three-day journey from\n22 her home country of Zimbabwe. Ms. Tungwarara was planning to visit her mother,\n23 Ms. Virimayi, and younger sister Rutendo, who were residing in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n24 10. Ms. Virimayi and Rutendo had fled Zimbabwe because they were threatened with\n25 violence and feared for their lives due to Ms. Virimayiโs role in an organization that she\n26 founded called the Association for the Widows of Fallen Heroes of Zimbabwe. On May 9, 2002,\n27 Ms. Virimayi was granted political asylum in the United States. Due to her motherโs political\n28 activities, M~. Tungwarara also faced danger in Zimbabwe of being kidnapped or killed, and she\n- 3 - 17804\\700576รท2\nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n\nrequired escorts for protection. On or about October 9, 2003, Ms. Tungwarara was granted\nderivative asylum status when her Refugee Asylum Relative Petition was approved.\n11.    Ms. Tungwarara arrived at SFO on January 9, 2002 at approximately 1:00 p.m. on\na valid tourist visa that her mother ~.ad obtained for her. Upon her arrival in San Francisco, an\n5 INS immigratioh officer asked Ms. Tungwarara a series of standard questions, such as the\n6 purpose of her visit. Ms. Tungwarara informed the~officer that she was, visiting her mother and\n7 sister. Instead of permitting Ms. Tungwarara to enter, ho~vever, the INS referred her to INS\n8 secondary inspection for further questioning.\n9 12.    At secondary inspection, Ms. Tungwarara was met by defendant Alfert Ludwigs\nI0 (\"Ludwigs\"), an 1NS agent. Ludwigs, alone and in concert with other defendants who are sued\n11 herein as DOES 1-25, proceeded to engage in a course of illegal, tortious, extreme and outrageous\n12 conduct that has severely harmed Ms. Tungwarara and deprived her of substantial rights under the\n13 United States Constitution and the California Constitution.\n14 13.    Ludwigs detained Ms. Tungwarara in the INS waiting room from approximately\n15 1:00 p.m. until at least 11:00 p.m. Despite the fact that Ms. Tungwarara had endured three days\n16 of flying--from Harare, Zimbabwe to Johannesburg to Paris to San Francisco--she was not\n17 offered any food until after t 1:00 p.m.\n18 14.    Ludwigs did not permit Ms. Tungwarara to have any contact with her mother,\n19 Ms. Virimayi, despite the fact that Ms. Virimayi was present at the airport to pick up\n20 Ms. Tungwarara. Ms. Virimayi had not seen her daughter for a substantial period for time.\n21 Ms. Tungwarara made repeated requests to be allowed to see her mother, but they were all denied\n22 by Ludwigs without explanation.\n23 15.    In the airport terminal, Ludwigs spoke with Ms. Virimayi, telling her that her\n24 daughter would be released only if Ms. Virimayi purchased a return ticket for her immediately.\n25 Ludwigs also told Ms. Virimayi that, after September 1 lth, there was a \"problem\" with \"โthese\n26 people from Africa.\" He further told Ms. Virimayi that Ms. Tungwarara was \"going back to\n27 Africa\" and he stated, \"We wonโt allow these people here--not after September 1 lth. Go back to\n28 the jungle.\n- 4 - 17804\\700576.2\nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n\n1 16.    Ludwigs was informed by Ms. Vilimayi that she was an asylum applicant. Despite\n2 this knowledge, Ludwigs did not refer Ms. Tungwarara to an Asylum Officer for an interview to\n3 assess her fear of returning to Zimbabwe. If he had, he would have learned that Ms. Tungwarara\n4 feared being kidnapped or killed by~er motherโs enemies in Zimbabwe.\n5 t7.    I]udwigs thereafter coerced Ms. Tungwarara, under extreme duress, to sign forms\n6 (which he did not permit her to read) containing false statements and to withdraw her application\n7 for entry.\n8 18.    Ms. Tungwarara was thereafter photographed, fingerprinted, handcuffed, and\n9 taken to a local jail where Defendants knew or reasonably should have known that Ms.\n10 Tungwarara would be strip-searched. The official who took Ms. Tungwarara to the jail confided\n11 that this was not supposed to be the way things happened, that what INS officials were doing was\n12 unfair, and that this was not the normal INS procedure. At the jail, Ms. Tungwarara was forced to\n13 undergo a humiliating strip search and physical examination in which she was forced to strip\n14 down to her undergarments and an officer touched her genitals. Ms. Tungwarara was not charged\n15 with any crime; she has never been arrested for or convicted of any clime. The strip search was\n16 conducted without probable cause, reasonable suspicion, lawful authority, or a rational or\n17 nondiscriminatory basis.\n18 19.    Ms. Tungwarara was then forced to spend the night in a jail cell. She was not\n19 segregated from the general jail population but was placed in a cell with women who were being\n20 held on criminal charges. This constituted a clear violation of INS policy, which instructs that\n21 immigrants such as Ms. Tungwarara shall not be booked into any jail facility \"absent\n22 extraordinary circumstances\" but should instead be housed at a facility provided by the airport, a\n23 local shelter care facility, detained under guard in a hotel, or placed in an INS holding facility\n24 segregated from other detainees.\n25 20.    Ms. Tungwarara was kept in the jail cell until approximately 6:00 or 7:00 a.m., at\n26 which time she was taken in chains to the INSโs San Francisco office. Ms. Tungwarara was then\n27 permitted to see her mother for the first and only time during the entire ordeal. She was only\n28 permitted to see her mother, however, for approximately five minutes, and she was separated\n- 5 - 17804\\700576.2\nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n\nfrom her by a glass wall. Emotionally distraught by the horrendous experience, Ms. Tungwarara\nwas barely able to speak to her mother and sat silently staring at her.\n21.    That morning, Bernice Brown, a family friend of Ms. Tungwarara, spoke to an\nINS official regarding Ms. Tungwar~...araโs treatment. The INS employee admitted that a French\n5 immigrant who fiad recently arrived in the Bay Area with improper documentation had been\n6 released by INS overnight to family and friends. WSaen Ms. Brown asked if Ms. Tungwarara\n7 could be released to her, the INS employee said, \"Absolutely not\" and refused to explain why Ms.\n8 Tungwarara was being treated differently. Ms. Brown was forced to purchase a return ticket for\n9 Ms. Tungwarara.\n10 22.    Ms. Tungwarara was forced to board a flight for Zimbabwe later that afternoon on\n11 January 10. Ms. Tungwarara had a layover in France and, because her visa had been cancelled by\n12 the INS, the French authorities treated her with suspicion and strip-searched her before allowing\n13 her to board her connecting flight. She finally arrived back in Zimbabwe on January 13.\n14 23.    Ms. Tungwarara is .n.ow attending school in South Africa. Following the incident\n15 with the INS agents, she has become depressed, angry, withdrawn, discouraged, anxious, unable\n16 to eat properly and afraid to travel. She has suffered from constant headaches, loss of appetite\n17 and sleep disturbances stemming from her experience with the INS agents.\n18 24. Defendants were on notice of the fact that visitors were being subjected to\n19 wrongful treatment by INS officials and that such officials were not receiving appropriate training\n20 and supervision. In fact, this is not the only incident involving misconduct by federal\n21 immigration officials at San Francisco International Airport. Over the last several years,\n22 Defendant United States and federal immigration officials have been sued on several occasions\n23 regarding racist and discriminatory actions by airport immigration officials.\n24 a. On or about July 16, 1999, Dr. Chizoba Nwosu, a United States citizen of Nigerian\n25 descent, arrived at San Francisco International Airport and was wrongfully detained, interrogated,\n26 and subjected to demeaning and offensive statements about her nationality, under circumstances\n27 similar to the circumstances surrounding Ms. Tungwararaโs ordeal. She later filed suit in the\n28 Northern District of California.\n- 6 \n-                               |7804\\700576.2\nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n\n1 b. On or about September 30, 2000, Rosa Zamora-Pineda, a Nicaraguan tourist,\n2 arrived at San Francisco International Airport and was wrongfully detained, jailed and subjected\n3 to demeaning and offensive statements about her ethnicity, under circumstances similar to the\n4 circumstances surrounding Ms. Tun~gwararaโs ordeal. She later filed suit in the Northern District\n5 of California.\n6 c. In March 2001, Rosebelt Munyua, akenyan national, arrived at San Francisco\n7 International Airport and was wrongfully detained, interrogated, and subjected to demeaning and\n8 offensive statements about her nationality, under circumstances similar to the circumstances\n9 surrounding MS. Tungwararaโs ordeal. She later filed suit in the Northern District of California.\nI0 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress)\n11 (Against Defendant United States of America)\n12 25.

California.\nOctober 13, 2005.\n1214 *1214 Anthony P. Schoenberg, Robert H.

Cheng, U.S. Attorney's Office, San Francisco, CA, for Defendant.\nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT ALFERT LUDWIGS' MOTION FOR\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT\nLAPORTE, United States Magistrate Judge.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Tsungai Tungwarara, an eighteen year old Zimbabwean citizen coming to the United States for the first\ntime, arrived at San Francisco International Airport (\"SFO\") on January 9, 2002 with a tourist visa. She stated that\nshe planned to visit her mother and sister in the Bay Area. After her initial immigration inspection, she was\nselected for a secondary inspection, which was conducted by defendant Alfert Ludwigs, an Immigration and\n[1]\nNaturalization Services (\"INS\") agent.  Tungwarara contends that during this secondary inspection, Ludwigs\nthreatened and intimidated her, eventually coercing her into signing a false statement and withdrawing her\napplication for entry into the United States. After being detained in an INS waiting room at SFO for more than ten\n1215 hours, she was handcuffed and *1215 transferred to the Oakland City Jail, where she was strip-searched\npursuant to jail policy, and placed in the general jail population overnight. She was forcibly removed to Zimbabwe\nthe next day, via Paris. Defendants claim that they excluded Plaintiff because she planned to stay in the United\nStates to study and therefore could not enter the country on a tourist visa. Plaintiff disputes this, and her mother\ntestified that Ludwigs made racially offensive remarks to her about aliens from African countries.\nBased on these events, Tungwarara filed claims against the United States for intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, false arrest and imprisonment, negligence, assault, battery, violation of the California Constitution, and\nviolation of California Civil Code section 52.1(b). She also sued the United States and Ludwigs for violating her\nFourth and Fifth Amendments rights. Ludwigs then filed this motion for summary judgment on the Fourth and\nFifth Amendment claims asserted against him, based on qualified immunity.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Qualified Immunity Standard.\nThe defense of qualified immunity protects \"government officials ... from liability for civil damages insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). To determine\nwhether Ludwigs is entitled to qualified immunity, the Court must examine \"(1) whether `taken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury,... the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional\nright'; and, if a violation of a constitutional right is found, (2) `whether the right was clearly established.'\" Wong v.\n\nUnited States, 373 F.3d 952, 966 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150\nL.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). The rule of qualified immunity \"`provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent\nor those who knowingly violate the law[.]'\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475\nU.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)). \"Therefore, regardless of whether the constitutional\nviolation occurred, the [official] should prevail if the right asserted by the plaintiff was not `clearly established' or\nthe [official] could have reasonably believed that his particular conduct was lawful.\" Romero v. Kitsap County, 931\nF.2d 624, 627 (9th Cir.1991). If Defendant had a reasonable but mistaken belief that his conduct was lawful,\nqualified immunity applies. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 205-6, 121 S.Ct. 2151.\nIn determining whether a legal proposition is \"clearly established,\" the Court first looks to the Supreme Court, the\nNinth Circuit, and local district courts. Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 565, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24\n(1978); Capoeman v. Reed, 754 F.2d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1985). In the absence of such binding precedent, the\nNinth Circuit allows district courts to examine \"whatever decisional law is available to ascertain whether the law is\nclearly established,\" including law from state courts, other circuits and other district courts. Capoeman, 754 F.2d\nat 1514; Drummond v. City of Anaheim, 343 F.3d 1052, 1060 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting Malik v. Brown, 71 F.3d 724,\n727 (9th Cir.1995)).\nB. Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment Right Was Not Clearly Established In 2002.\nThe Fourth Amendment proscribes \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" Allen v. City of Portland, 73 F.3d 232,\n1216 235 (9th Cir.1995). The test of reasonableness requires courts to balance the governmental *1216 interest that\njustifies the intrusion and the level of intrusion into the privacy of the individual. Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v.\nHannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1496 (9th Cir.1996). Plaintiff argues that the strip search at the Oakland City Jail\nviolated her Fourth Amendment rights because the severe level of intrusion into her privacy was not balanced by\nany governmental interest. Defendants deny that this \"non-intrusive\" search violated Plaintiffs rights. Even if the\nsearch did violate her rights, however, Ludwigs argues that he cannot be liable because (1) he did not personally\nconduct or order the strip search, or even make the decision to detain her at the Oakland City Jail; and (2) he is\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n1. Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact that Ludwigs set in motion events that foreseeably caused the strip\nsearch to occur.\nIt is undisputed that Ludwigs knew that all aliens sent to the Oakland City Jail pending repatriation were routinely\nstrip searched. It is also undisputed that the INS' policies strongly discourage holding non-admitted aliens in jail\n\"absent extraordinary circumstances.\" See Declaration of Patrice Harper (\"Harper Decl.\"), Ex. 11 at 2. Ludwigs\nargues, however, that he cannot be liable because his supervisor, Assistant Port Director Frederick Ho, made the\ndecision to detain Tungwarara and caused her to be sent to the Oakland Jail. See Harper Decl., Ex. 5 at\n154:17-155:10. It is undisputed that Ludwigs was not involved in the decision to detain Tungwarara and was not\nconsulted about where to detain her. See Declaration of Andrew Cheng (\"Cheng Decl.\"), Ex. F at 185:16-186:9;\nReply Declaration of Andrew Cheng (\"Cheng Reply Decl.\"), Ex. C at 22:4-23:25, 85:6-11. Nonetheless,\nTungwarara asserts that Ludwigs' falsification of her sworn statement set events in motion that foreseeably led to\nMr. Ho's decision to detain her in jail rather than parole her pending removal, and thus to the strip search.\nOn summary judgment, the Court cannot resolve disputed issues of fact, but only determine whether, viewing all\nthe disputed facts in the light most favorable to Tungwarara, she has raised a disputed issue sufficient to\nwithstand summary judgment. At her deposition, Tungwarara testified that the only purpose of her trip was to visit\nher mother. See Cheng Decl., Ex. E at 13:4-8, 22:5. During her secondary interview, she told Ludwigs that she\nhad traveled to San Francisco to visit her mother. Id. at 21:3-14, 25:15-19. She denied ever telling him that the\nintended to study at City College in San Francisco. Id. at 25:20-26:1. Although at one point Tungwarara testified\nthat she may have mentioned to Ludwigs that she intended to study journalism and broadcasting, she did not say\nthat she intended to do so in the United States. Id. at 85:15-21. (She is currently studying at University of Fort\nHare in South Africa. See Cheng Reply Decl., Ex. A at 206:20-22.) She admitted that it was possible that, during\nher secondary interview, she might have told Ludwigs that she was coming to San Francisco to go to college and\nget a degree, but she does not recall actually telling him this. Id., Ex. A at 184:3-21.\n\nPlaintiff claims that Ludwigs refused to write down the answers she gave him during the secondary interview,\nraised his voice and \"made implied verbal threats\" when she insisted on telling him that the purpose of her trip\nwas to visit her mother. Cheng Decl., Ex. E at 27:3-28:8, 33:9-34:15. Ludwigs does not even allude to this\npurpose in the sworn statement that he completed for her. See id., Ex. D. On the contrary, the sworn statement\n1217 unequivocally contends that she had come to the United States to \"go to college and get *1217 a degree.\" Id., Ex.\nD at 3. Tungwarara claims that she was not allowed to review the statement before certifying it, and only signed it\nbecause Ludwigs told her that she would be able to see her mother if she signed the document. Harper Decl., Ex.\n5 at 55:8-16, 57:6-23.\nBased on the contents of that sworn statement, Tungwarara was excluded from the United States because she\nheld a visitor visa, not a student visa. Even if she was excludable, Tungwarara could have been paroled while\nawaiting her return flight to Zimbabwe. However, at least in part because of the alleged misinformation in the\nsworn statement, Assistant Port Director Frederick Ho determined that Tungwarara was a flight risk and should\nnot be paroled into her mother's care while awaiting removal. Cheng Reply Decl., Ex. C at 86:15-87:23. Mr. Ho\ntestified that he decided to detain Plaintiff because she had no return ticket, had no assets in Zimbabwe, carried\nonly thirty dollars, had a mother who already lived in the United States, and admitted in her written statement that\nshe was coming to the United States to study and live and work; she therefore appeared to Mr. Ho to be an\n\"intending immigrant.\" Cheng Reply Decl., Ex. C at 86:15-87:23. While the written statement was only one factor\nin his decision, Defendant did not offer any testimony on whether Mr. Ho would have made the same decision to\ndetain Plaintiff overnight without that statement. In the absence of such evidence, the Court cannot presume on\nsummary judgment that Mr. Ho would have made the same decision. It is undisputed that Ludwigs knew that, if\nMr. Ho decided to detain Tungwarara overnight, she would be sent to the Oakland City Jail because SFO lacked\nproper detention facilities. Harper Decl., Ex. 5 at 177:11-178:25; Ex. 8 at 15:5-11. He also knew that, if this\nhappened, Plaintiff would be strip searched. Id., Ex. 5 at 187:3-21; Ex. 8 at 32:22-33:7. This appears to be a\nsufficient causal link to at least raise a triable issue of fact for purposes of summary judgment, see Wong v.\n[2]\nUnited States, 373 F.3d 952, 966 (9th Cir.2004), although it may or may not suffice at trial.  The Court therefore\nmust engage in the qualified immunity analysis.\n2. The strip search was unconstitutional\nIt is undisputed that the strip search here was not based on any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise, that\nTungwarara was carrying hidden weapons or contraband, but rather on the policy of the Oakland City Jail to\nconduct routine strip searches of all detainees. In these circumstances, even \"non-invasive\" strip searches like\nthe one to which Plaintiff was subjected would be plainly unconstitutional if she were a citizen or admitted alien. \nSee Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curium) (Fourth Amendment prohibits blanket\npolicy of strip searching individuals charged with minor offenses absent reasonable suspicion that detainee is\nconcealing contraband) (overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1\n(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc)); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1445-50 (9th Cir.1991) (to determine whether\n1218 search policy is constitutional, *1218 courts must balance need for the search against personal rights affected).\nThe question is whether Plaintiff's status as a non-admitted alien changes the outcome of the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis. Rights under the Fourth Amendment fall along a continuum, with United States citizens and resident\naliens afforded the most protection, aliens living in the United States without permission but who have developed\nties to the community somewhat less, and non-admitted aliens the least. Non-resident aliens who seek admission\ninto the United States are subject to the \"entry fiction\": \"`[A]lthough aliens seeking admission into the United\nStates may physically be allowed within its borders pending a determination of admissibility, such aliens are\nlegally considered to be detained at the border and hence as never having effected entry into this country.'\" \nAlvarez-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d\n1441, 1450 (9th Cir.1995) (en banc) (superseded by statute on other grounds)); see also Wong, 373 F.3d at\n970-71 (\"The Supreme Court has long recognized a distinction between the constitutional rights afforded those\nwho have effected an entry into the U.S., whether legally or otherwise, and those considered never to have\nentered.... Aliens inside the U.S., regardless of whether their presence here is temporary or unlawful, are entitled\nto certain constitutional protections unavailable to those outside our borders.... At the same time, under the \"entry\nfiction\" ... an alien seeking admission has not \"entered\" the United States, even if the alien is in fact physically\n\npresent\"). \"Noncitizens who are outside U.S. territories enjoy very limited protections under the Constitution.\" \nBarrera-Echavarria, 44 F.3d at 1448.\nThe Constitution does confer some fundamental rights to non-admitted aliens. For example, in Lynch v.\nCannatella, 810 F.2d 1363, 1372-3 (5th Cir.1987), the Fifth Circuit held that while excludable aliens have fewer\nrights than illegal aliens who have entered the United States and integrated to some degree into the population,\nand significantly less rights than legal residents and citizens, they still have the fundamental right to be free from\ninhumane detention, including beating and drugging by United States officials. The Ninth Circuit quoted Lynch\nwith approval for its determination that the entry fiction \"`does not limit the right of excludable aliens detained\nwithin United States territory to humane treatment.'\" Wong, 373 F.3d at 972 (entry fiction pertains mostly to\nnarrow question of scope of procedural rights available in admission process, and does not apply to certain other\nconstitutional rights); see also Papa v. United States, 281 F.3d 1004, 1010 (9th Cir.2002) (citing Lynch and\nexplaining that \"[l]imited rights under the Due Process Clause extend to detained aliens. Officials may not, for\nexample, consciously disregard or act with deliberate indifference toward a detainee's safety by knowingly\nplacing that person in harm's way\"); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 704, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653\n(2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (removable aliens cannot be tortured).\nThe Supreme Court has left open two distinct, but often related, questions regarding strip searches of non-\nadmitted adult aliens at the border, the first relating to the search's location at the border, regardless of the\nimmigration status of the person being searched, and the second to the impact, if any, of that person's\nimmigration status:\nIt is also important to note what we do not hold. Because the issues are not presented today we suggest no view\non what level of suspicion, if any, is required for nonroutine border searches such as strip, body-cavity, or\n1219 involuntary x-ray searches. Both parties would *1219 have us decide the issue of whether aliens possess lesser\nFourth Amendment rights at the border; that question was not raised in either court below and we do not consider\nit today.\nUnited States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 541 n. 4, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). The\nNinth Circuit has addressed the first question squarely, finding that \"our precedents clearly hold that a strip\nsearch involves more than a routine invasion of the traveler's personal privacy and therefore requires at least an\nindividualized `real suspicion.'\" United States v. Handy, 788 F.2d 1419, 1420 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting United States\nv. Aman, 624 F.2d 911, 912 (9th Cir.1980)); see also United States v. Tsai, 282 F.3d 690, 694 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(quoting Handy in case involving permanent resident alien, and agreeing that strip search requires individualized\nsuspicion).\nA number of cases strongly indicate that some level of objective reason for suspicion is also required to strip\nsearch non-admitted aliens at the border. For example, in Flores v. Meese, a district court held that INS officers\ncould not strip search juvenile illegal aliens at the border absent a reasonable suspicion that the search would\nyield weapons or contraband. 681 F.Supp. 665 (C.D.Cal.1988). Without this reasonable suspicion, strip searching\na juvenile alien would be unconstitutional. Id. at 669. The Flores decision balanced a number of factors that\nweighed against the constitutionality of routine strip searches, only one of which was age. All the other factors\napplied equally to adults. In reviewing a number of cases, including cases from the Ninth Circuit, the Flores Court\nnoted that:\n[i]n all of these cases, policies authorizing routine strip searches of adults charged with minor offenses were\nfound to be constitutionally repugnant. Certainly, application of such policies to children, who have not been\ncharged with any criminal offense, is even more so. Children confined by the INS are not charged with any\ncriminal offense, let alone an offense that might indicate a propensity to conceal weapons or contraband on their\npersons.\n681 F.Supp. at 668; see also United States v. Rodriguez, 592 F.2d 553, 556 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"While anyone at a\nborder may be stopped for questioning and subject to an inspection of luggage, handbags, pockets, wallets,\nwithout any suspicion at all on the part of customs officials, `real suspicion' is required before a strip search may\nbe conducted\"); Kirkpatrick v. Los Angeles, 803 F.2d 485, 489 (9th Cir.1986) (government interest in preventing\nentry of contraband into country justifies searches at border that would otherwise not be constitutional, but border\n\nofficials nonetheless must have \"real suspicion\" that contraband will be discovered before ordering strip search);\n[3]\nUnited States v. Oyekan, 786 F.2d 832 (8th Cir.1986) (reversing district court's implicit holding that two\nNigerian citizens' \"fourth amendment rights were in fact violated when they were detained and subjected to a strip\nsearch and x-ray on less than probable cause\" because the customs officials had reasonable suspicion to strip\nsearch and x-ray the defendants\"); United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, 36 F.3d 859 (9th Cir.1994) (in case\ninvolving nonresident alien adults, Ninth Circuit held that border officials needed reasonable suspicion that\n1220 person smuggled drugs in *1220 order to strip search them). Although none of these cases explicitly addresses\nwhether the same rule applies to strip searching non-admitted adult aliens at the border, Oyekan and Gonzalez-\nRincon involve non-resident aliens. Moreover, Defendants have cited no case that supports a different\nconclusion.\nThe purpose of border inspections is to determine whether an alien is admissible or carrying contraband or\nweapons. See United States v. Tsai, 282 F.3d 690, 699 (9th Cir.2002) (Berzon, J., concurring) (\"The authority to\nsearch at the border has always been justified as `necessary to prevent smuggling and to prevent prohibited\narticles from entry,' ... and to determine whether the individual presenting himself at the border is `entitled to\ncome in'\") (internal citations omitted); Kirkpatrick, 803 F.2d at 489 (\"The government has an interest in preventing\nthe entry of contraband into the country which justifies some searches at the border that would not otherwise be\nconstitutional\") (citing Montoya, 473 U.S. 531, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985)). Strip searches therefore\nshould be tailored to serve these purposes.\nAs the Supreme Court observed in United States v. Flores-Montano, intrusive searches of the person implicate\nimportant dignity and privacy interests. These interests are fundamental to all human beings, not just admitted\naliens and citizens. 541 U.S. 149, 152, 124 S.Ct. 1582, 158 L.Ed.2d 311 (2004); see also Thompson v. City of\nLos Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir.1989). The Ninth Circuit has pointed out the need not to interpret the\nentry fiction so expansively that it \"would allow any number of abuses to be deemed constitutionally permissible\nmerely by labeling certain `persons' as non-persons.\"' Wong, 373 F.3d at 974. The court also observed that\ndenying any rights to non-admitted aliens who properly present themselves for inspection at the border would\nprovide a perverse incentive for aliens to enter the country secretly and live here unlawfully, yet enjoy greater\nConstitutional protections. Id. at 973-74. These same considerations apply with equal force to bar the routine strip\nsearches of non-admitted aliens at the border.\nThe Court therefore concludes that some level of suspicion is required under the Fourth Amendment to conduct\n[4]\nstrip searches of non-admitted aliens.  Indeed, this Court concludes that this right is now clearly established in\nlight of the reasoning employed by the Ninth Circuit in Wong, which applies analogously to the right to be free\nfrom non-routine searches absent some level of suspicion.\n3. This right was not clearly established in 2002.\nThe more difficult issue is whether Tungwarara's Fourth Amendment right to be free from a strip search absent\nsuspicion that she was concealing weapons or contraband was clearly established in 2002. As the court in Wong\nrecognized, prior to its decision in that case the law was unsettled regarding the extent to which non-admitted\n1221 aliens enjoyed substantive constitutional rights. 373 F.3d at 976. As Barrera-Echavarria*1221 observed, \"the law\nis not settled with regard to nonprocedural rights. Some of the cases involving excludable aliens suggest that\nthey do enjoy certain substantive constitutional rights.\" 44 F.3d at 1449 (citations omitted). In fact, in Papa, the\nNinth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of claims of unreasonable search and seizure and\ndiscrimination by an alien seeking admission into United States on the ground that such aliens are not afforded\ndue process protections. 282 F.3d at 1010. And the Supreme Court observed in United States v. Verdugo-\nUrquidez that the Fourth Amendment's use of the term \"the People of the United States,\" rather than \"persons,\"\n\"[w]hile ... by no means conclusive ... suggests that the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment ... refers to a\nclass of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection\nwith this country to be considered part of that community.\" 494 U.S. 259, 265, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222\n(1990).\nThe strip search here was an unwarranted and painful affront to Plaintiffs privacy and dignity, and this Court has\nconcluded that it was unconstitutional. At the same time, the pat-down search here did not constitute the kind of\n\n\"gross physical abuse,\" \"reckless indifference to safety,\" or \"torture\" that was more clearly forbidden by the case\nlaw as of 2002. Plaintiff testified that she underwent a pat-down search, conducted by a female officer in private.\nThe officer was not mean to her, did not raise her voice, and did not touch her genitals. See Harper Decl., Ex. 1\nat 168:21-169:9; Cheng Reply Decl., Ex. A at 147:20-149:17; cf. Cheng Reply Decl., Ex. A at 154:3-154:25\n(describing strip search at Paris airport, where Plaintiff underwent a body cavity search). This is not a case where\nthe official's actions were so egregious that the Court can conclude that Tungwarara's right was clearly\nestablished absent clearly applicable contemporaneous decisional law. Cf. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194,\n125 S.Ct. 596, 599, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (per curiam) (\"in an obvious case, these standards [of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment] can `clearly establish' the answer, even without a body of relevant\ncase law\") (citing Hope, 536 U.S. at 738, 122 S.Ct. 2508).\nThe case that most strongly supports Plaintiff's attempt to show that her right was clearly established in 2002 is \nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, 36 F.3d 859 (9th Cir.1994). There, in a case involving a non-resident adult\nalien, the court noted that strip searches \"of course ... must be supported by reasonable suspicion.\" 36 F.3d at\n864. However, the court there did not explicitly consider the issue of the relative rights of an alien subject to the\nentry fiction left open in Montoya. One could argue that the right was so obvious that the court did not need to do\nso. That argument falters, however, in the face of the Ninth Circuit's decision en banc one year later in Barrera-\nEchavarria, characterizing the state of the law with regard to nonprocedural rights of non-admitted aliens as\n\"unsettled.\" See also Wong, 373 F.3d at 976 (citing same for proposition that Fifth Amendment protection for\naliens was not clearly established).\nThe cases on which Tungwarara relies are distinguishable because none involves a non-admitted adult alien at\nthe border like Plaintiff where the court squarely addresses the implication of the alien's non-admitted status. The\ndefendant in United States v. Handy, 788 F.2d 1419 (9th Cir. 1986), was returning from a trip to Thailand, and\nappears to have been either a U.S. citizen or resident. The defendant in United States v. Aman, 624 F.2d 911,\n912 (9th Cir.1980), also appears to have been returning to the United States from a trip to Thailand. While the\n1222 nationality of the *1222 defendant in United States v. Rodriguez, 592 F.2d 553 (9th Cir.1979), is never mentioned,\nthe fact that he held an \"alien reentry permit\" suggests that he was a lawful permanent resident returning to the\nUnited States, rather than a non-admitted alien seeking to enter the United States for the first time. Although this\nCourt has concluded that Flores, 681 F.Supp. 665, which struck down a policy requiring the routine strip\nsearching of all juvenile non-admitted aliens, supports the unconstitutionality of the strip search here of Plaintiff,\nwho was eighteen, the case could mistakenly but perhaps reasonably be distinguished because of the age\ndifference. Id. at 667-68.\nAccordingly, although this Court concludes that a non-invasive strip search of a non-admitted adult alien at the\nborder without any suspicion of any kind is unconstitutional, the Court cannot conclude that this right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the incident. If the same search had occurred later after the Ninth Circuit's decision in \nWong, or had been more invasive or abusive at the time, the Plaintiff s \"clearly established\" rights would likely\nhave been violated. On the uncontested facts of the search here, however, Ludwigs is entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\nC. Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment Right To Equal Protection Was Not Clearly Established In 2002.\nTungwarara argues that Ludwigs violated her Fifth Amendment right to be free from racial discrimination when he\ncoercively interrogated her, separated her from her family, and sent her to the Oakland jail as punishment, all\nbecause of her race. Although the Fifth Amendment does not contain an explicit equal protection clause, the\nSupreme Court has held that discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to violate due process. See Bolling v.\nSharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); United States v. Rodriguez-Lara, No. 04-10113,\n421 F.3d 932, 938, n. 2, 2005 U.S.App. Lexis 18427, at *6 n. 2 (9th Cir. Aug. 26, 2005) (noting that while plaintiff\nbrought an equal protection claim under the Fourteen Amendment, \"a claim of discrimination by the federal\ngovernment implicates the equivalent equal protection guarantee inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment\").\nAs evidence of Ludwigs' racial animus, Tungwarara offers the deposition of her mother, who testified that\nLudwigs told her that Plaintiff should \"go back to the jungle\" and that \"these people from Africa\" were a \"problem\"\nand were not allowed into the country \"after September 11th.\" Cheng Decl., Ex. A at 94:11-17; Ex. B at\n\n59:23-60:14. For purposes of summary judgment, Tungwarara therefore has created a triable issue of fact as to\nwhether Ludwigs violated her Fifth Amendment rights by discriminating against her on the basis of her race:\nThe entry fiction does not preclude non-admitted aliens ... from coming within the ambit of the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause. We cannot countenance that the Constitution would permit immigration\nofficials to engage in such behavior as rounding up all immigration parolees of a particular race solely because of\na consideration such as skin color.... We can imagine no proper governmental interest furthered by the purely\ninvidious discrimination alleged to have been carried out by individual INS officers in this case.\nWong, 373 F.3d at 974-75. Plaintiff therefore satisfies the first step of the qualified immunity analysis.\nTo establish that this constitutional right was clearly established in 2002, Plaintiff argues that INS handbooks at\nthe time unequivocally instructed inspectors that immigration laws were intended to be non-discriminatory and\n1223 should be administered *1223 \"fairly and equitably.\" See Harper Decl., Exs. 12-13. However, in 2004 00 two years \n97\nafter the incident 00 the Ninth Circuit stated that previously it had \"never squarely held that [non-admitted aliens]\n97\nare entitled to equal protection guarantees, nor [had] the Supreme Court.\" Wong, 373 F.3d 952. In fact, in 2002,\nthe Ninth Circuit noted that an alien's Bivens claim that INS officials discriminated against him upon entry was\ncorrectly dismissed because \"[a]liens are not afforded due process protections when they seek admission to the\nUnited States.\" See Papa, 281 F.3d at 1010 (but noting that detained aliens did have \"[l]imited rights under the\nDue Process Clause\" not to be treated with deliberate indifference or placed in harm's way by officials). INS field\nmanuals are not \"decisional law\" for purposes of qualified immunity; Ninth Circuit cases like Wong and Papa are.\nMoreover, Tungwarara's attempt to limit Wong based on that plaintiff's atypical immigration status fails because\nthe plaintiff in Wong, if anything, would have been entitled to greater Fifth Amendment protections that the\nPlaintiff here. In Wong, the plaintiff entered the United States legally in 1985, resided here for fourteen years, and\napplied for permanent residence status before leaving the country in 1999. Upon reentry eighteen days later, she\nwas found excludable because she had failed to secure advanced parole and thus was deemed to have\nabandoned her application for permanent residence. The court therefore noted that if there were any doubt as to\nwhether non-admitted aliens were entitled to some level of equal protection, the balance was tipped in Wong's\nfavor by her particular circumstances, including her allegation that her failure to get advance parole was due to\nillegal discrimination against her while she was still lawfully residing in the United States. See Wong, 373 F.3d at\n976. In contrast, Plaintiff here was attempting to enter the country for the first time in 2002 on a tourist visa and\nhad no prior ties to the United States. The constitutional right that Tungwarara seeks to vindicate therefore was\nnot clearly established until the Ninth Circuit's decision in Wong in 2004. Accordingly, Ludwigs is also entitled to\nqualified immunity on Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment claim.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated here, Ludwigs' motion for summary judgment on Tungwarara's Eighth claim for violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment and Ninth claim for violation of the Fifth Amendment is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] On March 1, 2003, after these events, the INS became part of the Department of Homeland Securities, and\nsome of its functions were assumed by the newly created Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Bureau.\n[2] Neither Wong nor the cases it cites addresses whether the initial actor must intend the unlawful consequences\nof the act that set in motion the constitutional violation, or whether these consequences must simply be\nforeseeable. Here, an INS officer at SFO in 2002 apparently had no choice but to house detained aliens at the\nOakland City Jail. If foreseeability alone suffices, Ludwigs could be liable even if his decision to detain someone\nwas based on an entirely proper motive (e.g., a proper determination that an alien carried forged papers).\n[3] The Ninth Circuit noted that the Supreme Court had suggested in Montoya that \"real suspicion\" was a third\nstandard that was likely not grounded in the Fourth Amendment, thus calling into question prior Ninth Circuit\ncases, such as Handy and Rodriguez, using that terminology. Kirkpatrick, 803 F.2d at 489 n. 3. Neither \nKirkpatrick nor Montoya, however, questioned the holdings of those cases.\n\n[4] The Court does not decide today what level of suspicion is required, nor even whether that suspicion need be\nparticular to the individual as opposed to, for example, a category of those traveling from a particular place\nidentified as the source of numerous terrorist attacks. Cf. Wong, 373 F.3d at 974, n. 29 (holding that equal\nprotection component of Due Process applies to non-admitted aliens, but declining to address whether the usual\nheightened scrutiny standard applies to racial, national, or religious profiling of such aliens); Lynch, 810 F.2d at\n1373 (government classifications based on alienage may be subject to either close scrutiny or rational basis\nanalyses).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
