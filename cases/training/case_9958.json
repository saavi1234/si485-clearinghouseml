    "summary": "<p>On July 2, 2003, an individual action was filed against the City and County of San Francisco pro se by an individual who was allegedly falsely arrested and subjected to a strip search after being transported to the county jail under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and, after being reassigned twice, was presided over by Judge Charles Breyer. The plaintiff claimed that the false arrest and strip search were in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law. The plaintiff retained private counsel during the litigation.</p>\r\n<p>This case was a companion case to <a href=\"../../../../case/38/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bull v. City and County of San Francisco</a>, No. C 03-1840 CRB (N.D. Cal.), a class-action lawsuit challenging the strip search policy of the City and County of San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>After attempts to settle the <em>Yourke</em> case failed, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On September 3, 2004, the District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on his strip search claims and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the false arrest claim. The court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's state law claims.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2006, the District Court issued an Amended Memorandum and Order in the related <em>Bull</em> case, (a) holding that some of the defendants' policies were constitutional while others were unconstitutional and (b) finding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to some, but not all, claims. See Bull v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, 2006 WL 449148 (N.D. Cal. Feb 23, 2006). Based on that order, the parties in <em>Yourke</em> filed a second set of motions for partial summary judgment on the issues of (a) the constitutionality of the plaintiff's strip search and (b) the defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity. The District Court dismissed these motions without prejudice and stayed all further proceedings while the <em>Bull</em> appeal was pending. The <em>Bull</em> appeal, filed on March 26, 2006, was decided by Ninth Circuit on August 22, 2008. The Circuit Court affirmed the decision that the blanket strip-search policy was a violation of constitutional rights and also held that the defendants would not be protected by qualified immunity.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2010, the court ruled on the parties' renewed cross motions for summary judgment in this case, granting the defendants' motion and denying the plaintiff's motion. 2010 WL 3701789. Plaintiff's appeal of this judgment was rejected by the Ninth Circuit on December 3, 2010, for failure to respond to a November order. Sometime between the end of 2010 and May 2012, the plaintiff appealed the 2010 judgement pro se on the Fourth Amendment claim and his California Penal Code &sect; 4030. The court of appeals affirmed the district court's judgment on May 25, 2012. 473 Fed.Appx. 725. This case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2013, Judge Charles Breyer dismissed the <em>Bull</em> suit without prejudice and approved its settlement claim.</p>",

The Policy\n21\nrequires a visual strip search of all arrestees classified for custodial housing in the general jail\n22\npopulation.  Plaintiff challenges the legality of the strip search, asserting both a federal claim,\n23\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983, for violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and state\n24\nclaims for violation of California Penal code section 4030 and Art. I, sections 1 and 13 of the\n25\nCalifornia Constitution.\n26\nThe parties have each filed renewed cross-motions for summary judgment.  Plaintiff\n27\nseeks partial summary judgment as to his state claim under California Penal Code section\n28\n4030 only.

After carefully reviewing the parties’ memoranda\n2 and the evidentiary record, and after hearing oral argument, the Court hereby DENIES\n3 Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and GRANTS Defendants’ motion for\n4 summary judgment as to all claims.\n5 BACKGROUND\n6 I. Factual History\n7 On September 18, 2002, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Plaintiff was driving home from\n8 downtown San Francisco when he pulled over to the side of the road in San Francisco’s\n9 Tenderloin neighborhood to speak to an acquaintance who was walking her bicycle on the\n10 sidewalk.  When his acquaintance approached the vehicle, an undercover police officer\na\nni 11 emerged and detained her on suspicion of a drug transaction.  At the same time, Officer\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Richard Jones drove up behind Plaintiff in an unmarked car, instructed Plaintiff to turn off\noa\nCC\nct of  13 his ignition, and asked for Plaintiff’s driver’s license.  When Plaintiff asked Officer Jones\nrict \nstri 14 why he was being stopped, Officer Jones indicated that Plaintiff was blocking traffic. \nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 Officer Jones proceeded to run a warrant check on Plaintiff’s driver’s license and found an\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 outstanding misdemeanor warrant for Plaintiff’s arrest for failure to appear in traffic court. \no\nteN\nnie  17 At that time, Plaintiff was placed under arrest.  This Court has previously determined that the\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 initial traffic stop and subsequent arrest of Plaintiff were lawful.  See 9/3/04 Order [Dkt 67].\nF\n19 Upon his arrest, Plaintiff was first taken to Tenderloin police station, where he\n20 remained for approximately one hour.  Plaintiff was then transported to San Francisco\n21 County Jail No. 9, where he was booked and placed in a holding cell.  The holding cell\n22 contained a phone and the phone numbers of bail bondsmen.  Plaintiff began calling bail\n23 bondsmen at this time but was unable to secure bail.  Plaintiff continued to attempt to bail out\n24 over the course of the next six (6) hours but was unsuccessful.  At approximately 10:00 a.m.,\n25 Plaintiff was classified for custodial housing in the general jail population.  Pursuant to the\n26 jail’s Classification Search Policy, Plaintiff was then strip searched and dressed in an orange\n27 jump suit in preparation for his removal to the general jail population.\n28\n2\n\n1 Approximately an hour after he was strip searched, but before he was physically\n2 transferred to the general jail population, Plaintiff was finally able to obtain a bail bond. \n3 Plaintiff was released on bail shortly thereafter.\n4 II. Procedural History\n5 On July 2, 2003, Plaintiff filed a Complaint pursuant to section 1983 alleging that he\n6 had been unlawfully arrested and unlawfully strip searched.  On June 9, 2004, Plaintiff was\n7 permitted to file an amended complaint adding state law claims for violation of California\n8 Penal Code section 4030 and Art. I, sections 1 and 13 of the California Constitution.\n9 By Order dated September 3, 2004, this Court granted Defendants’ motion for\n10 summary judgment on Plaintiff’s false arrest claim. \na\nni 11 On May 19, 2006, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 federal and state strip search claims.  By Order dated June 27, 2006, this Court denied the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 cross-motions for summary judgment without prejudice and stayed the matter pending\nrict \nstri 14 instruction from the Ninth Circuit in the related case of Bull v. City & County of San\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 Francisco, No. C-03-1840. \nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 On February 10, 2010, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in Bull v. City & County of\no\nteN\nnie  17 San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964, 982 (9th Cir. Cal. 2010) (hereinafter “Bull”).  \nUh\nt\n \nor 18 On August 6, 2010, the parties filed renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. \nF\n19 Plaintiff seeks partial summary judgment as to his state claim under California Penal Code\n20 section 4030 only.  Defendants seek summary judgment as to all claims. \n21 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n22 Summary judgment is appropriate where “the pleadings, depositions, answers \n23 to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there\n24 is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n25 matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that\n26 there is no genuine dispute with respect to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment\n27 as a matter of law.  Celotex Corp. v Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Only if the moving\n28 party is successful in showing no genuine issue of material fact, or a complete lack of\n3\n\n1 evidence supporting the non-moving party’s case, does the burden shift to the non-moving\n2 party to “set out ‘specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.’”  Id. at 324-25 (quoting\n3 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  If the non-moving party fails to make this showing, the moving party\n4 is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  Moreover, in\n5 deciding a summary judgment motion, a court must view the evidence in the light most\n6 favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in its favor.  Anderson\n7 v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). \n8 DISCUSSION\n9 I. Plaintiff’s Federal Claim\n10 The Ninth Circuit has now unequivocally determined that the Classification Search\na\nni 11 Policy at issue in this case does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  See Bull v. City &\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964, 982 (9th Cir. Cal. 2010) (“[W]e conclude that San\noa\nCC\nct of  13 Francisco’s policy requiring strip searches of all arrestees classified for custodial housing in\nrict \nstri 14 the general population was facially reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 notwithstanding the lack of individualized reasonable suspicion as to the individuals\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 searched.”).  In reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit largely applied standards set forth\no\nteN\nnie  17 by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) and Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 78 (1987).  The Court explained:\nF\n19 [T]he balance between the need for the San Francisco strip search policy and\n“the invasion of personal rights that the search entails” must be resolved in\n20 favor of the jail system’s institutional concerns.  [Bell, 441 U.S. at 559].  While\nstrip searches are invasive and embarrassing, and while this type of security\n21 measure “instinctively gives us the most pause,” id. at 558, we must conclude\nthat under Bell, San Francisco’s strip search policy was reasonable and\n22 therefore did not violate the class members’ Fourth Amendment rights.\n23 Bull, 595 F.3d at 975.  Thus, while Bull, following Bell, recognizes that a strip search\n24 pursuant to the Policy may, at least in some circumstances, constitute an “invasion of\n25 personal rights” of the arrestee, the court concluded that this invasion does not make the\n26 searches performed pursuant to the Classification Search Policy unreasonable under the\n27 Fourth Amendment given legitimate penological interests in “maintaining security for\n28\n4\n\n1 inmates and employees by preventing contraband smuggling.”  Id.  See also Turner v. Safley,\n2 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987).\n3 Plaintiff does not dispute that he was strip searched pursuant to the Policy when, due\n4 to the fact that he was unable to secure a bail bond during the six (6) hours in which he was\n5 confined in a holding cell, he was classified for custodial housing in the general jail\n6 population.  See Yourke Decls., Exhs. B, C, and D to the Decl. of Joanne Hoeper in Support\n7 of Defs.’ Renewed Mot. for SJ (Dkt. 125).  Because Plaintiff admits that he was strip\n8 searched in accordance with the Policy and does not allege that the strip search was\n9 administered in a manner inconsistent the Policy, the Ninth Circuit’s decision upholding the\n10 Policy in Bull is dispositive as to his Fourth Amendment claim.  There is no genuine issue of\na\nni 11 material fact with respect to Plaintiff’s federal claim in light of Bull, and summary judgment\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 for Defendants is now appropriate on the federal claim.\noa\nCC\nct of  13 II. Plaintiff’s State Claims\nrict \nstri 14 A. California Penal Code section 4030\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 With respect to Plaintiff’s state claim that the strip search violated California Penal\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 Code section 4030, the related case of Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, No. C-03-\no\nteN\nnie  17 1840, is again instructive.  In that case, Plaintiff Bull argued, as here, that a strip search of an\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 arrestee pursuant to the Classification Search Policy violates section 4030 when the search is\nF\n19 conducted absent individualized suspicion for any arrestee held in custody on a misdemeanor\n20 or infraction offense not involving weapons, a controlled substance, or violence.1  See Bull v.\n21 City & County of San Francisco, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9120, at *61-62 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 23,\n22 2006). \n23\n24 1Subdivision (f) of section 4030 provides in pertinent part:\n25 No person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or infraction offense, except\nthose involving weapons, controlled substances or violence . . . shall be subjected to a\n26 strip search or visual body cavity searchp rior to placement in the general jail populatio,n\nunless a peace officer has determined there is reasonable suspicion based on specific and\n27 articulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a strip\nsearch will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband.\n28\nCal Pen Code § 4030(f) (emphasis added).\n5\n\n1  In rejecting this claim and denying Plaintiff Bull’s motion for summary judgment,\n2 this Court determined that “a search without reasonable suspicion may take place consistent\n3 with section 4030 after: (1) the three subdivision (g) conditions [of Penal Code section 4030]\n4 are met; and (2) the circumstances demonstrate that the individual detainee is actually\n5 destined for the general jail population absent some unexpected reason for release.”2  Bull,\n6 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9120, at *66.  Here, there is no genuine dispute that the three\n7 subdivision (g) conditions of Penal Code 4030 were met.  At the time of the search, Plaintiff\n8 (i) was not cited and released, (ii) was not released on his own recognizance, and (iii) was not\n9 able to post bail after a reasonable time of at least three hours.  See Yourke Decls., Exhs. B,\n10 C, and D to the Decl. of Joanne Hoeper in Support of Defs.’ Renewed Mot. for SJ (Dkt. 125). \na\nni 11 As such, the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment on the section 4030 claim turn on\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 whether there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the circumstances at the time of the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 strip search demonstrated that Plaintiff was actually destined for the general jail population\nrict \nstri 14 absent some unexpected reason for release.  See Bull, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9120, at *61-\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 62. \nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 In an attempt to raise a genuine factual question as to whether he was actually\no\nteN\nnie  17 destined for the general jail population, Plaintiff argues that he “told [the] Sheriff’s deputies\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 several times prior to the strip search that he was definitely going to bail out shortly” and that\nF\n19 “[t]here was nothing ‘unexpected’ about Plaintiff’s bailing out of Jail.”  See Pl.’s Resp. to\n20 Defs.’ Renewal of Mot. for SJ [Dkt 128], incorporating by reference Pl.’s Am. Opp. to Defs.’\n21 Mot. for SJ at 15 [Dkt 89].  However, Plaintiff’s own declarations clearly indicate that,\n22 notwithstanding his continuing attempts to bail out, Plaintiff was actually destined for the\n23 general jail population when, approximately eight (8) hours after his arrest and six (6) hours\n24 after being placed in a holding cell, he was classified for custodial housing, strip searched,\n25\n2 Subdivision (g) of section 4030 provides tha t no arrestee held in custody on a\n26 misdemeanor or infraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances or violence amy\nbe confined in the general jail population “unless all of the following are true:  (i) The person\n27 is not cited and released[ ;] (ii) The person is  not released on his or her own recognizance\npursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2[;] (iii)\n28 The person is not able to post bail within a reasonable time not less than three hours.”  Cal. Pen\nCode § 4030(g).\n6\n\n1 and dressed in an orange jump suit in preparation for transfer into the general jail population. \n2 See Yourke Decls., Exhs. B, C, and D to the Decl. of Joanne Hoeper in Support of Defs.’\n3 Renewed Mot. for SJ (Dkt. 125).  The fact that Plaintiff was finally able to post a bail bond\n4 approximately an hour after his classification and strip search, but prior to his physical\n5 transfer to the general jail population, does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n6 whether he was actually destined for the general jail population at the time the search\n7 occurred.  As this Court has previously determined, searches under these circumstances do\n8 not run afoul of section 4030.  See Bull, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9120, at *68.  Thus, there is\n9 no genuine issue of material fact with respect to Plaintiff’s section 4030 claim, and summary\n10 judgment for Defendants on the claim is appropriate.\na\nni 11 B. California Constitution, Art. I, sections 1 and 13 \nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Finally, Plaintiff claims that the strip search violated his inalienable right to privacy\noa\nCC\nct of  13 under Art. I, section 1 of the California Constitution and was unreasonable under Art. I,\nrict \nstri 14 section 13.  Although the rights defined in the California Constitution have independent force\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 and “are not mirror images of their federal counterparts,” American Academy of Pediatrics v.\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 Van de Kamp, 214 Cal. App. 3d 831, 839 (1989) (citing Committee to Defend Reproductive\no\nteN\nnie  17 Rights v. Myers, 29 Cal. 3d 252, 261 (1981); People v. Brisendine, 13 Cal. 3d 528, 551\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 (1975)), within the context of search and seizure, the “‘article I, section 1 ‘privacy’ clause [of\nF\n19 the California Constitution] has never been held to establish a broader protection than that\n20 provided by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or article I, section 13\n21 of the California Constitution.’”  In re York, 9 Cal. 4th 1133, 1149 (1995) (quoting People v.\n22 Crowson, 33 Cal. 3d 623, 629 (1983)).  As such, Plaintiff’s California Constitution claims\n23 can overcome the Ninth Circuit’s upholding of the Classification Search Policy in Bull only\n24 to the extent that Art. I, section 13 of the California Constitution is read to provide broader\n25 protection than the Fourth Amendment in the context of jailhouse strip searches of arrestees. \n26 The Fourth Amendment defines the minimum protection provided under Art. 1,\n27 section 13.  Craft v. County of San Bernardino, 468 F. Supp. 2d 1172, 1180 (C.D. Cal. 2006)\n28 (citing In re Lance W., 37 Cal. 3d 873, 875 (1985)).  At least since Wolf v. Colorado, 338\n7\n\n1 U.S. 25 (1949), California courts have treated Art. I, section 13 [formerly § 19] as\n2 “substantially equivalent” to the Supreme Court’s construction of the Fourth Amendment. \n3 People v. Triggs, 8 Cal. 3d 884, 892, n.5 (1973) (citing Blair v. Pitchess, 5 Cal. 3d 258,\n4 270-271, n. 6 (1971)).  Although California courts have found that section 13 provides\n5 greater protection than the Fourth Amendment in at least some contexts (see California v.\n6 Martin, 45 Cal.2d 755, 759-761 (1955) (vicarious exclusionary rule); California v.\n7 Brisendine, 13 Cal. 3d 528, 548-52 (1975) (search incident to arrest)), these cases did not\n8 involve searches in the custodial detention setting, where expectations of privacy are\n9 substantially diminished and the security concerns of the correctional facility are paramount. \n10 See People v. Owens, 112 Cal. App. 3d 441, 448 (1980).  \na\nni 11 Moreover, the “touchstone for all issues under the Fourth Amendment and article I,\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 section 13 of the California Constitution is reasonableness.”  Ingersoll v. Palmer, 43 Cal. 3d\noa\nCC\nct of  13 1321, 1329 (1987).  The Ninth Circuit has interpreted this language to mean that “the right to\nrict \nstri 14 be free from unreasonable searches under Art. I § 13 of the California Constitution parallels\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 the Fourth Amendment inquiry into the reasonableness of a search.”  Sanchez v. County of\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 San Diego, 464 F.3d 916, 928-29 (2006).  Just as under federal law, the reasonableness of a\no\nteN\nnie  17 search under California law turns on the balance between the government interest served and\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 the intrusion of the search.  See Ingersoll, 43 Cal. 3d at 1329.  \nF\n19 Here, the record reflects a problem with contraband smuggling at the jail where\n20 Plaintiff was searched.3  There was thus a substantial government interest in conducting strip\n21 searches of arrestees classified for housing in the general population–both to detect\n22 contraband and to deter arrestees from attempting to smuggle contraband into the general jail\n23 population.  Moreover, San Francisco’s Classification Search Policy limited strip searches to\n24 those arrestees who were classified for housing in the general population.  The Policy also\n25\n3“Strip searches at County Jail No. 9 have led to the discovery of weapons and other\n26 contraband on the persons of arrestees. Defendant produced evidence that from  April 2000\nthrough April 2005 strip searches at County Jail No. 9 resulted in the discovery of 73 cases of\n27 illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia hidden in body cavities. In that sam e time period, six\nweapons were also discovered as a result of strip searches.”  Bul, l2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9120,\n28 at *6.  \n8\n\n1 mandated that the searches be carried out “in a professional manner in an area of privacy”\n2 and specifically excluded physical body cavity searches.  San Francisco Sheriff's Dep’t Proc.\n3 No. E-03, E-03(III).  Given the diminished expectations of privacy in the custodial detention\n4 setting, and given that this Court could find no California authority either holding or\n5 implying that Art. I, section 13 of the California Constitution provides greater protections\n6 than the Fourth Amendment within the context of jailhouse strip searches of arrestees, a strip\n7 search conducted pursuant to, and within the confines of, the Classification Search Policy\n8 does not violate section 13.  Because Plaintiff does not dispute that he was strip searched\n9 pursuant to the Policy, nor that the search was administered in a manner consistent with the\n10 Policy, there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to his California Constitution\na\nni 11 claims, and summary judgment in Defendants’ favor is appropriate.\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Conclusion\noa\nCC\nct of  13 For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial\nrict \nstri 14 Summary Judgment (Dkt. 126) and GRANTS Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ntesn  15 (Dtk. 124).4 \nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 IT IS SO ORDERED.\no\nteN\nnie  17\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF\n                                                            \n19 Dated: September 16, 2010 CHARLES  R.

(Docket No. 96.)  In doing so, the Court\n19\ndeclined to rule on all issues raised in those motions--including the constitutionality of\n20\nPlaintiff’s strip search, as well as the issue of Defendants’ qualified immunity--until the\n21\nNinth Circuit ruled on an appeal in a related case, Mary Bull, et al. v. City and County of San\n22\nFrancisco, et al., No. C 03-1840 CRB.  Bull involved, among other issues, a determination as\n23\nto qualified immunity in the context of the Defendants’ strip search policy generally.\n24\nNow pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Motion for Leave To File\n25\nMotion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Motion for Summary Judgment.  In this\n26\nmotion, Plaintiff notes that Defendants have taken an interlocutory appeal in this case, and\n27\nthat they rely in their opening brief on appeal on a declaration by Undersheriff Jan Dempsey. \n28\nPlaintiff further notes that he previously objected to the declaration and challenged its\nadmissibility.  In the pending motion, he requests this Court to rule on the admissibility of\n\nCase 3:03-cv-03105-CRB     Document 105      Filed 12/18/2006     Page 2 of 2\n1 Undersheriff Dempsey’s declaration “before the Ninth Circuit rules” on the interlocutory\n2 appeal taken in this case.\n3 The Court hereby DENIES Plaintiff’s ex parte motion.  The Court reiterates that it has\n4 denied without prejudice all pending motions in this case, including the government’s\n5 previous motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity.  It is therefore\n6 inappropriate and premature to consider the admissibility of evidence, such as Undersheriff\n7 Dempsey’s declaration, which was submitted in connection with those previously filed\n8 motions.  The Court declines to consider the admissibility of such evidentiary issues in a\n9 vacuum, and the Court again reiterates that all proceedings in this case are STAYED until the\n10 Ninth Circuit rules on the pending appeal in Bull.\nt 11 IT IS SO ORDERED.\nr\nu\no a 12\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of                                                              \n Dis District  14 Dated:  December 18, 2006 CUHNAITRELDE SST  RA.T BERSE DYIESTRRICT JUDGE\ntates orthern  15\nS N 16\nted  For the  17\ni\nn\nU\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nG:\\CRBALL\\2003\\3105\\order 5 declaration.wpd 2",
