Neiman Marcus store filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Marshalls Service.  Plaintiffs alleged that following their arrest, they were subjected to strip and squat searches without a reasonable individualized suspicion that they were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs further alleged that the Marshals Service routinely subjected women, but not men, to pre-arraignment strip and squat searches, as was the case with six men who were arrested with Plaintiffs but not searched.  Plaintiffs proceeded under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and sought compensatory damages of one million dollars each.</p><p>The Government moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  On March 21, 2002, the District Court (Judge Bates) granted the Government's motion in part and denied it in part, holding that Plaintiffs could not state a FTCA claim for wrongful arrest or violation of equal protection but that they could maintain a FTCA claim for invasion of privacy (specifically, the tort of intrusion upon seclusion).  Helton v. U.S. 191 F.Supp.2d 179 (D.D.C. 2002).</p><p>On November 8, 2002, the parties entered into a Stipulation for Settlement and Dismissal.   Under the terms of the settlement, each of the five plaintiffs (together with their attorneys) received $8,000, for a total settlement amount of $40,000.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "191 F.Supp.2d 179 (2002)\nShauna HELTON, et al., Plaintiffs,\nv.\nUNITED STATES of America, Defendant.\nNo. Civ.A.01-0385(JDB).\nUnited States District Court, District of Columbia.\nMarch 21, 2002.\nSean R. Day, College Park, MD, for plaintiffs.\nKenneth Wainstein, Meredith Manning, Mark Nagle, United States Attorney's Office, Washington, D.C., for\ndefendant.\n180 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n*180\nBATES, District Judge.\nPlaintiffs in this action brought against the United States (\"defendant\") exclusively under the Federal Tort Claims\nAct (\"FTCA\") are five women who were arrested for unlawful entry in connection with an \"anti-fur\" demonstration\nat the Neiman Marcus store at Mazza Gallerie Mall. Complaint ยถ 5. They allege that they were placed in United\nStates Marshals Service custody, and that prior to arraignment they were compelled \"to remove clothing and\nsubmit to a strip and squat search.\" Id. ยถ 6, ยถ 8. They further allege that six men arrested with them were not\nsubjected to such searches, and that the Marshals Service routinely subjects women, but not men, to pre-\narraignment strip and squat searches. Id. ยถ 9, ยถ 10. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages of $ 1 million each for\ninjuries suffered as a result of these \"unlawful searches and invasions of privacy.\" Id. ยถ 11.\nDefendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted. Defendant contends, first, that plaintiffs cannot bring a constitutionally based tort claim against the\nUnited States under the FTCA, and second, that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for invasion of privacy\nunder District of Columbia law.\nI. Constitutional Claims\nIn their Opposition, plaintiffs do not even respond to defendant's position that constitutional claims cannot be\nbrought against the United States under the FTCA, and thus plaintiffs effectively concede the point. That is for\ngood reason, inasmuch as the law is clear that the FTCA does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates for constitutional claims. See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 477-78, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308\n(1994); Clemente v. United States, 766 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1985),cert. denied,474 U.S. 1101, 106 S.Ct.\n881, 88 L.Ed.2d 917 (1986): Laswell v. Brown, 683 F.2d 261, 267-68 (8th Cir.1982),cert. denied,459 U.S. 1210,\n103 S.Ct. 1205, 75 L.Ed.2d 446 (1983); Birnbaum v. United States, 588 F.2d 319, 327-28 (2d Cir.1978). Plaintiffs'\nbasic unlawful search claim derives from familiar search and seizure principles under the Fourth Amendment to\nthe Constitution, and the contention that plaintiffs were subjected to strip and squat searches, while male\ndetainees were not, raises an equal protection argument grounded in the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs' claim that\nthey were subjected to \"unlawful searches,\" which thus appears to be based on Fourth and Fifth Amendment\n[1]\nprinciples, is therefore dismissed.\nPlaintiffs' attempt to establish some vague independent tort of \"unlawful search\" that can survive dismissal is\nunavailing. They concede that no such tort is recognized in the District of Columbia, see Opposition at 4, and\noffer no basis upon which this Court should recognize one in the first instance. Indeed, except to the extent that\n\nsuch a common law tort might be based on constitutional principles00and thus not be within the scope of the\n97\nFTCA00it is not clear that it would differ in any material respect from the invasion of privacy tort plaintiffs already\n97\n181 pursue in this action. The Court therefore declines *181 plaintiffs' invitation to create a new tort for \"unlawful\nsearch\" not heretofore recognized in the District of Columbia.\nII. Invasion of Privacy Claim\nThe resolution of defendant's motion to dismiss the invasion of privacy claim under the FTCA is not so simple.\nInitially, defendant misstated plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim as one for \"publicity that places one in a false\nlight,\" claiming that plaintiffs had not satisfied the basic elements of that tort under District of Columbia law.\nDefendant's Memorandum at 5. Plaintiffs, however, counter that they actually raise claims of invasion of privacy\nfor \"intrusion upon their solitude and seclusion,\" which is distinct from a \"false light\" tort. Plaintiffs' Opposition at 2.\nAs the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has stated, \"[i]nvasion of privacy is not one tort, but a complex of\nfour, each with distinct elements and each describing a separate interest capable of being invaded.\" Wolf v.\nRegardie, 553 A.2d 1213, 1216-17 (D.C.1989). The threshold question, then, is whether plaintiffs have stated a\nclaim satisfying the basic elements of the \"intrusion upon seclusion\" prong of the invasion of privacy tort.\nIn Wolf, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted Section 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts\n(1977) and its characterization of a tort for \"intrusion upon seclusion\":\nOne who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another\nor his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the\nintrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\n553 A.2d at 1217. The court then explained the tort in more detail:\nThe tort of intrusion upon seclusion has three elements: (1) an invasion or interference by physical\nintrusion, by use of a defendant's sense of sight or hearing, or by use of some other form of\ninvestigation or examination; (2) into a place where the plaintiff has secluded himself, or into his\nprivate or secret concerns; (3) that would be highly offensive to an ordinary, reasonable person.\nId. (citations omitted). The court observed that \"[u]nlike some other types of invasion of privacy, intrusion does not\nrequire as an essential element the publication of the information obtained.\" Id. (citations omitted). \"In fact,\" the\ncourt added, \"the acquisition of information is not a requisite element of a ยง 652B cause of action. Rather, it is the\nnature of the intrusion which initially fixes liability.\" Id. (citation and footnote omitted).\nThe court in Wolf suggested some of the circumstances in which the tort of intrusion upon seclusion could arise,\nincluding harassment, peeping through windows, eavesdropping on private conversations, entering a person's\nhome without permission, or secretly searching a person's belongings. Id. at 1217-18 (citations omitted). District\nof Columbia case law has not defined the precise parameters of the tort. However, although the District of\nColumbia courts have yet to address whether an \"unlawful\" strip search would satisfy the elements of an intrusion\nupon seclusion tort, other courts have recognized similar physical or visual intrusions upon a person's body as\nrising to the level of possible intrusions upon seclusion. See, e.g., Borse v. Piece Goods Shop, Inc. 963 F.2d 611,\n621 (3rd Cir.1992) (\"[m]onitoring collection of urine samples appears to fall within the definition of an intrusion\nupon seclusion because it involves the use of one's senses to oversee the private activities of another\"); Hidey v.\nOhio State Highway Patrol, 116 Ohio App.3d 744, 689 N.E.2d 89, 92-93 (1996) (forcing plaintiff at traffic stop to\n182 pull pants out to observe buttocks and to unbutton blouse to expose *182 breast in search for drugs);[2]Stockett\nv. Tolin, 791 F.Supp. 1536 (S.D.Fla.1992) (grabbing breasts and running fingers up shirt constituted intrusion of\nplaintiff's physical solitude under Florida law); Lake v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 582 N.W.2d 231 (Minn.1998)\n(photograph exposing plaintiffs' naked body to others constituted tort of intrusion upon seclusion); Sanchez-Scott\nv. Alza Pharmaceuticals, 86 Cal. App.4th 365, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 410 (2001) (presence of drug salesman in\nexamining room while woman undressed for physical examination amounted to an intrusion upon seclusion).\nThe Court concludes that under District of Columbia law plaintiffs have stated a claim for intrusion upon seclusion\nbased on their allegations of a strip and squat search ordered by the Marshals Service. Particularly in light of\n\nSection 652B of the Restatement, specifically relied upon by the court in Wolf, this Court concludes that the\nDistrict of Columbia courts would find that the alleged strip search of plaintiffs satisfies the elements of the tort of\nan intrusion upon seclusion. Reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, they could\nestablish the three elements for a claim of intrusion upon seclusion under District of Columbia law.\nFirst, plaintiffs could show that the alleged strip and squat search conducted by the Marshals Service invaded or\ninterfered with00visually and perhaps physically00 their \"interest\" in remaining clothed and shielding their naked\n97 97\nbodies from others. Second, it is apparent that plaintiffs have secluded their naked bodies within their clothes. In\nthe language of Comment c to Section 652B, one throws clothes \"about his person\" to cover his body from\nothers; thus, plaintiffs secluded their bodies behind their clothes from the view of others, and the Marshals\nService allegedly intruded into that \"place\" and those private concerns. Finally, it is clear that a strip search can\nbe humiliating and degrading. Being forced00allegedly without legal justification 00to strip and squat in view of law\n97 97\nenforcement officials to determine if one has any concealed contraband would be highly offensive to a\nreasonable person. As the Seventh Circuit noted in Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th\nCir.1983), one of the first federal appellate cases to consider the constitutionality of a strip search of a person\narrested for a misdemeanor, visual strip searches are \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,\nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" 723 F.2d at 1272 (citing \nTinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980)) (\"In short, we can think of few exercises of authority by the state\nthat intrude on the citizen's privacy and dignity as severely as the visual anal and genital searches practiced\nhere.\"). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the District of Columbia would recognize an intrusion upon\n183 seclusion tort based on the actions of *183 the Marshals Service as alleged here, and that plaintiffs could\n[3]\nestablish the elements of that tort.\nEven if plaintiffs can establish the elements of intrusion upon seclusion, defendant counters that District of\nColumbia law limits the availability of invasion of privacy to the bounds recognized by the United States\nConstitution. See Defendant's Reply at 2. Defendant reads Jackson v. District of Columbia, 412 A.2d 948\n(D.C.1980), as holding that in order to prove a claim for invasion of privacy, the invasion must rise to the level of a\nviolation of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution. In Jackson, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\nstated that \"the Jacksons are precluded from bringing a tort claim for invasion of privacy, for the right of privacy is\ncognate to the values and concerns protected by constitutional guarantees.\" 412 A.2d at 954 (quoting Afro-\nAmerican Publishing Co. v. Jaffe, 366 F.2d 649, 654 (D.C.Cir.1966) (en banc)). As the defendant then puts it,\n\"plaintiffs here must be able to show that the Deputy Marshals violated the Constitution in order to assert a tort\nclaim based on District of Columbia law.\" Defendant's Reply at 3.\nDefendant misreads Jackson. There, plaintiffs brought suit for mistaken arrest, raising claims for false arrest,\nfalse imprisonment, negligence, and invasion of privacy based on local police and federal agents breaking into\nthe house of the wrong Michael Jackson. The family brought damages suits based on the mistaken arrests in\nboth Superior Court and United States District Court, the latter a constitutional claim. The federal court granted\nsummary judgment against plaintiffs, which was affirmed on appeal, finding that the arrest was reasonable and\nbased on probable cause. See Jackson v. Young, 600 F.2d 280 (D.C.Cir.1979). The District of Columbia Court of\nAppeals, relying on the federal court ruling, found that collateral estoppel precluded the claims brought in\nSuperior Court:\nIn addition to the (uncontested) bar against reasserting a deprivation of the constitutional right of\nprivacy, we conclude that the Jacksons are precluded from bringing a tort claim for invasion of\nprivacy, for \"(t)he right of privacy ... (is) cognate to the values and concerns protected by\nconstitutional guarantees.\" Afro-American Publishing Co. v. Jaffe, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 70, 75, 366\nF.2d 649, 654 (1966) (en banc) (footnote omitted). A tort claim for invasion of privacy may be\nsuccessfully asserted only if the claimant has suffered an unreasonable and serious interference\nwith protected interests. Id. The district court's findings that the arrest was reasonable and that the\nmistake was unintentional accordingly preclude this claim.\n412 A.2d at 954 (emphasis added).\n\nHence, the holding of Jackson is a routine application of collateral estoppel principles 00because the federal court\n97\nheld that the arrest was reasonable and the mistake unintentional, the arrest did not rise to an unreasonable and\nserious interference of a protected interest, which is a key element for an invasion of privacy claim, and plaintiffs\nwere precluded from relitigating that issue in Superior Court. Jackson does not hold broadly that a tort claim for\n184 invasion of privacy can only be brought if the allegations would also be a deprivation of the *184 constitutional\nright to privacy, and defendant's selective quote from Jackson does not support that proposition. Jackson simply\ndoes not address the situation here, where no prior judicial resolution of reasonableness has already been made.\nTo the extent, then, that defendant's point is that a claim for intrusion upon seclusion which is otherwise\nactionable under state00here, District of Columbia00law is barred under the FTCA because the challenged conduct\n97 97\nalso violates the Constitution, that point is not well-taken. See, e.g., Rhoden v. United States, 55 F.3d 428, 432 n.\n5 (9th Cir.1995) (FTCA action permitted based on conduct violative of Constitution and also constituting false\nimprisonment under state law); Garcia v. United States, 896 F.Supp. 467, 474-75 (E.D.Pa. 1995) (fact that FTCA\ndoes not waive sovereign immunity for constitutional claims does not bar state common law tort claims under\nFTCA for strip search); see also Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19-20, 23, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980)\n[4]\n(observing that identical conduct could give rise to both FTCA and Bivens claims).  Plaintiffs may proceed with\nan intrusion upon seclusion claim under the FTCA notwithstanding that the alleged conduct might also violate the\nFourth Amendment and therefore support a constitutional tort claim distinct from the FTCA.\nIndeed, even if defendant were correct in asserting that plaintiffs must show that the Marshals Service violated\nthe Constitution in order to prevail on their invasion of privacy (i.e., intrusion upon seclusion) claim, it is likely that\nplaintiffs could do so. If the Deputy Marshals did not have an individualized reasonable suspicion that\nplaintiffs00charged only with misdemeanors of unlawful entry00were concealing weapons, drugs, or other\n97 97\ncontraband, the strip and squat search may have violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against\nunreasonable searches. There is a significant body of case law holding that police or prison officials may not strip\nsearch an individual arrested for misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless there is reasonable suspicion that\nthe individual is concealing contraband or weapons. Most federal courts of appeals have ruled00some dating back\n97\nover two decades00that strip searches of individuals arrested for minor offenses violate the Fourth Amendment\n97\nunless the individual is reasonably suspected of concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. See, e.g., \nWilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (strip search of woman arrested for drunk driving\nunconstitutional); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir.2001) (strip search of arrestee for minor\noffense held unconstitutional); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989) (police may not strip search\nindividuals arrested for non-violent minor offenses when there is no reasonable basis for believing that the\narrestee is carrying weapons or contraband); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2nd Cir.1986) (\"Fourth\n185 Amendment precludes prison officials from *185 performing strip searches of arrestees charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor offenses absent reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or\nother contraband.\"); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 741 (8th Cir.1985) (body cavity search of individual\ncharged with misdemeanor ruled unconstitutional); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985)\n(holding strip search policy unconstitutional as applied to misdemeanants awaiting bond absent reasonable\nsuspicion); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.1984) (strip search of individual arrested for minor\ntraffic offense held unconstitutional absent reasonable suspicion that arrestee carrying or concealing\ncontraband); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984) (strip search of individual with expired car tags\nunconstitutional where no circumstances indicated he might have been concealing contraband or weapons); \nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (striking down Chicago's strip search policy\nas applied to misdemeanors); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981) (strip search of a woman\ncharged with driving while intoxicated was unconstitutional); see also Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F.Supp. 772,\n787-89 (E.D.Pa.1993) (strip searches of minor females arrested for criminal trespass at animal rights protest\nwere unconstitutional).\nAlthough almost every federal court of appeals has ruled that strip searches of individuals arrested for nonviolent\nmisdemeanors or other minor offenses violate the Fourth Amendment absent \"reasonable suspicion,\" this Circuit\nhas yet to address the issue. The District Court reached the issue in Doe v. Berberich, 704 F.Supp. 269\n(D.D.C.1988), which involved a strip search of two women arrested on federal park property for smoking\nmarijuana in their car. Before they placed the women in a holding cell, the officers ordered strip searches\n\nbecause they suspected the women were concealing contraband or evidence. In an action for constitutional\n[5]\nviolations under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and tort claims under the FTCA,  the court found that the officers had\nreasonable cause to strip search the women because they had been smoking marijuana and marijuana was\nfound in the car. Id. at 271. The court's central holding is in line with virtually every other decision on this issue:\n\"[t]here must be reasonable suspicion that the category of offenders subject to strip searches might possess\nweapons or contraband.\" Id. The court then held that the strip searches were constitutional even though plaintiffs\nwere charged only with misdemeanors, because the police had complied with governing regulations and had\nreasonable suspicion to believe plaintiffs were concealing contraband or drugs, given the nature of the offense of\npossession of a controlled substance. Id. at 272.\nThat is not to say that this wealth of case law holding that strip searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors\nor other minor offenses are unconstitutional absent reasonable suspicion means that plaintiffs can proceed with a\nclaim for violation of their constitutional rights. The law is clear that constitutional tort claims are not actionable\nunder the FTCA, see FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. at 477-78, 114 S.Ct. 996, and plaintiffs have brought this action\nsolely under the FTCA. But their claims for common law invasion of privacy 00specifically the tort of intrusion upon\n97\nseclusion00are actionable under the FTCA, and survive defendant's motion to dismiss. Even if defendant were\n97\n186 right (which it is *186 not) in interpreting Jackson to make an invasion of privacy (or intrusion upon seclusion)\nclaim coextensive with a constitutional tort claim, that would not preclude pursuit of the common law claim under\nthe FTCA. And at this early stage of the proceedings, in light of the overwhelming authority questioning the\nconstitutionality of strip and squat searches like those alleged here, the Court simply cannot conclude that\nplaintiffs have failed to state a claim for intrusion upon seclusion, even if they were required to show a violation of\nthe constitutional right to privacy in order to do so.\nWhen assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs' factual allegations must be presumed true\nand should be liberally construed in their favor. Phillips v. Bureau of Prisons, 591 F.2d 966, 968 (D.C.Cir.1979); \nAlexander v. FBI, 971 F.Supp. 603, 607 (D.D.C.1997). Plaintiffs must be given every favorable inference that may\nbe drawn from their allegations of fact. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90\n(1974). The complaint should be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that no set of facts proffered in\nsupport of plaintiffs' claim would entitle them to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2\nL.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1254 (D.C.Cir.1987).\nHere, the Court liberally construes plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim as one for intrusion upon seclusion.\nMoreover, the allegation of a strip and squat search without reasonable suspicion that plaintiffs were concealing\nweapons or contraband satisfies the elements of intrusion upon seclusion as stated in the Restatement and Wolf\nv. Regardie. Although the Court reaches no conclusion as to the merits of plaintiffs' claims, it finds that they have\nsufficiently stated claims00invasion of privacy under the specific prong of intrusion upon seclusion00for which relief\n97 97\ncan be granted under the FTCA. Thus, the Court dismisses plaintiffs' constitutional claims for unreasonable\nsearches under the Fourth Amendment, and dismisses plaintiffs' claims for discriminatory searches in violation of\ntheir equal protection rights. However, plaintiffs' claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act for intrusion upon\nseclusion may go forward.\nDefendant's motion to dismiss is therefore granted in part and denied in part. A separate order will be issued on\nthis date.\nORDER\nFor the reasons stated in the Memorandum Opinion issued on this date, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n1. Defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act for an \"unlawful\nsearch\" based on violations of the Constitution is GRANTED.\n2. Defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act based on an alleged\ndenial of equal protection under the Constitution is GRANTED.\n\n3. Defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act for invasion of\nprivacy, specifically the tort of intrusion upon seclusion, is DENIED.\n[1] In their complaint, plaintiffs sue only under the FTCA; they have not asserted claims in this action for\nconstitutional violations under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S.\n388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), or any other theory. Plaintiffs' equal protection challenge against the\nMarshals Service00that only women were strip searched00is purely a constitutional challenge that does not come\n97 97\nwithin plaintiffs' common law invasion of privacy claim and hence cannot be raised in this action under the FTCA\nat all.\n[2] The court in Hidey (689 N.E.2d at 92-93) relied on Comment c to Section 652B of the Restatement, which\nstates that: \nThe defendant is subject to liability under the rule stated in [ยง 652B] only when he has intruded into a private\nplace, or has otherwise invaded a private seclusion that the plaintiff has thrown about his person or affairs. Thus\nthere is no liability for the examination of a public record concerning the plaintiff, or of documents that the plaintiff\nis required to keep and make available for public inspection. Nor is there liability for observing him or even taking\nhis photograph while he is walking on the public highway, since he is not then in seclusion, and his appearance is\npublic and open to the public eye. Even in a public place, however, there may be some matters about the plaintiff,\nsuch as his underwear or lack of it, that are not exhibited to the public gaze; and there may still be invasion of\nprivacy when there is intrusion upon these matters. [emphasis added]\n[3] Defendant's assertion that a cellblock is not a place where one is secluded simply misses the point. The\nseclusion here is of one's body behind clothes wherever one happens to be. Defendant's logic would lead to the\nabsurd result that a strip search on a public highway in full view of passing motorists is less offensive (and less\nactionable) than one conducted in the detainee's living room.\n[4] Federal courts have reached conflicting results regarding intrusive body or strip search cases brought under\nthe FTCA. In Bradley v. United States, 164 F.Supp.2d 437 (D.N.J. 2001), an African-American woman brought \nBivens claims, as well as invasion of privacy claims under the FTCA, after an airport patdown search by the\nCustoms Service. The court dismissed the FTCA claims because the customs agents were performing a\n\"discretionary function.\" Id. at 454. In contrast, in Garcia v. United States, 896 F.Supp. 467 (E.D.Pa.1995), the\ncourt refused to dismiss claims for, inter alia, invasion of privacy under the FTCA based on a strip search\nconducted by customs agents, concluding that the \"discretionary function\" exception does not apply if the\nconduct at issue is unconstitutional. Id. at 475-476. Defendant has not raised the \"discretionary function\"\nexception under the FTCA in its motion.\n[5] The court dismissed the claims under the FTCA because plaintiffs failed to file an administrative claim, as\nrequired by statute, and dismissed the claims against the officers in their official capacity for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. 704 F.Supp. at 271.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
