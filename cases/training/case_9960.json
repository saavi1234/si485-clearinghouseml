These students were arrested, the minors taken to a juvenile facility and the 18-year-olds incarcerated at TGK jail. They were charged with the misdemeanor violation of Fla. Stat. 836.11 which prohibits anonymous publication if it \"tends to expose any religious group to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy.\"  The arresting officer enhanced each charge under Florida's \"hate crime\" statute, converting the misdemeanors into felonies. </p><p>The Miami Dade County's Department of corrections had a policy of strip searching felony arrestees upon booking. Plaintiff was subjected to a full strip and body cavity search. Ultimately, all charges were dismissed by the state attorney general's office, along with a public statement acknowledging that the statute under which the students were arrested is unconstitutional and unenforceable.</p><p>On April 18, 2000, the Court (Judge Ursula Ungaro-Benages) denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against the County, finding that the strip search was not unreasonable, as it was conducted in the context of an arrest for a felony offense.</p><p>On October 18, 2000, the Court (Judge Ursula Ungaro-Benages) denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against the school on grounds that she had failed to identify a sufficient policy, custom or decision of a final policymaker of the School Board that caused the alleged unconstitutional arrest and thereby permit the imposition of § 1983 liability.</p><p>On March 14, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. 285 F.3rd 962 (11th Cir. 2002).</p><p></p>",

CT. \nS.D. OF FL\" •. J.II.-MI \nDefendants. \n------------------------~/ \nORDER \nTHIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Michael Alexander's Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs Complaint, filed February 19, 1999. \nTHE COURT has considered the Motion, the pertinent portions of the  record and  is \notherwise fully advised in the premises.  On February 19,  1999, Plaintiff filed the Complaint \nalleging, inter alia, that Defendant Michael Alexander (\"Alexander\") violated her First and Fourth \nAmendment rights by unlawfully arresting her on February 20, 1998 for her participation in the \ndistribution of anonymous, contemptuous pamphlets to  other students at Killian Senior High \nSchool. 1  Defendant Alexander files the instant Motion arguing that Plaintiffs claims against him \nmust be dismissed based on his entitlement to qualified immunity. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nOn a motion to dismiss the Court must view the Complaint in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, Jenkins v.  McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 1848-49, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 \n- i  \nthe{]~ \nJ \n'The Complaint also contains claims against Defendants Miami Dade County and \nMiami Dade County School Board. \n~ \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 2 of 9(cid:10)\n(1969), and may grant the motion only when \"it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove \nno set offacts in support ofhis claim which could entitle him to relief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. \n41,45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Bradberry v. Pinnel/as County, 789 F.2d 1513, \n1515 (11th Cir. 1986).  Moreover, the Court must, \"at this stage of the litigation, ... accept [the \nplaintiffs] allegations as true.\"  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73  104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 \nL.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Stevens v. Dept. ofH  ealth and Human Services, 901 F.2d 1571, 1573 (lith Cir. \n1990). Thus, the inquiry focuses on whether the challenged pleadings\" give the defendant fair notice \nof what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" Conley, 355 U.S. at 47. \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant Alexander violated her First and Fourth Amendment rights \nI \nby arresting Plaintiff for her participation in the anonymous publication \"The First Amendment.\" \nAlexander moves to dismiss the Complaint against him on the ground that he is protected by \nqualified immunity because his arrest of Plaintiff was not objectively unreasonable under the \ncircumstances. Plaintiff contends that the law was clearly established at the time Alexander arrested \nher that such an arrest violated her First and Fourth Amendment rights and therefore Defendant \nAlexander is not entitled to qualified immunity. \nIt is well settled that government officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to \nqualified immunity and may not be held liable in their individual capacities if their conduct violates \nno \"clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a  reasonable person would have \nknown.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 231-33 \n(1991).  In Zeigler v. Jackson, 716 F.2d 847, 849 (11th Cir. 1983), the Eleventh Circuit established \na two-prong analysis to be used in applying the Harlow test.  Under the first prong of the Zeigler \n2 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 3 of 9(cid:10)\ntest, a government official must allege and prove that he acted within his discretionary authority by \nshowing \"objective circumstances which  would compel  the conclusion  that  his  actions were \nundertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties and within the scope of his authority.\" Zeigler, \n716 F.2d at  849; see also Rich  v.  Dollar,  841  F.2d  1558,  1564 (11th Cir.  1988).  Once this \nrequirement is met, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defendant violated \"clearly \nestablished\" law.  Zeigler, 716 F.2d at 849; Rich, 841 F.2d 1558. \n\"Clearly established\" for purposes of qualified immunity means that \"the contours of the \nright must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable government official would understand that his \nconduct violates that right.\"  Wilson v.  Layne,  119 S.Ct.  1692, 1699 (1999); citing Anderson v. \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)(\"This is not to say that an official is protected by qualified \nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that \nin the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\").  Thus, a plaintiff must point \nto case law which \"pre-dates the official's alleged improper conduct, involves materially similar \nfacts, and 'truly compels' the conclusion that the plaintiff had a right [clearly established] under \nfederal law.\" Lassiter v. Alabama A & M University, Board of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th \nCir. 1994). For the law to be deemed \"clearly established\" such that qualified immunity no longer \nprotects the government official, the law must have been developed in such a concrete and factually \ndefined context to make it obvious to all reasonable government actors in the defendant's place that \nwhat he is doing violates federal law.  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640. \nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that Defendant Alexander was acting within the scope \nofhis discretionary authority when he arrested Plaintiff. See Plaintiff's Response at 2.  The burden \ntherefore shifts to the Plaintiff to show that Defendant Alexander violated a clearly established \n3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 4 of 9(cid:10)\nstatutory or constitutional right when arresting Plaintiff. \nPursuant to the second prong of the Zeigler test, the Court must consider whether, from an \nobjective perspective, a reasonable police officer could have believed that arresting a student for her \nalleged participation in anonymous pamphleteering that contained contemptuous speech was lawful \nin light of clearly established First Amendment law and the information the officer possessed at the \ntime ofthe arrest.  Swint v.  City of Wadley, 51 F.3d 988, 995 (11th Cir. 1995).  For the reasons \nexplained below, the Court finds that as a matter of law it was not objectively unreasonable for a \npolice officer to arrest a student for her participation in anonymous, contemptuous pamphleteering \nbecause there was no clear statutory or constitutional violation. \nPlaintiff contends that Defendant Alexander violated her First Amendment and Fourth \nAmendm~t rights by arresting her pursuant to Fla. Stats. §836.112 and §775.0853, both of which \nI \n2  Fla. Stat. §836.11 entitled Publications which tend to expose persons to hatred, \ncontempt, or ridicule prohibited.--and states in pertinent part: \nIt shall be unlawful to print, publish, distribute or cause to be printed, \npublished or distributed ... any publication ... which tends to expose any \nindividual or any religious group to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy \nunless the following is clearly printed or written thereon: \n(a) the true name and post-office address of the person, firm, partnership, \ncorporation or organization causing the same to be printed, published or \ndistributed; ... \n3  Fla.

However, Plaintiffs \narguments  that  Fla.  Stat.  §836.11  and  §775.085  are  unconstitutional  and  violate  \"clearly \nestablished\" First Amendment law of which a reasonable police officer should have known, are \nplainly without merit.  First, in State v.  Stalder,  630 So.2d 1072, 1077 (Fla.  1994 ), the Florida \nSupreme Court held that Fla. Stat. §775.085 is constitutional in that it punishes criminal conduct \nrather than expression.  See id.  With respect to §836.11, the statute was enacted in 1971, remained \nvalid at the time of Plaintiffs arrest and has never been declared  unconstitutional. \nThe continued validity of §836.11 is dispositive of Defendant Alexander's entitlement to \n* \nqualified immunity. See Robinson v. City ofS avannah, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6859,  17 (S.D. Ga. \n1987)(noting the impropriety of expecting a police officer to predict a court's determination \nregarding the constitutionality of a statute when the issue has not yet been resolved by a court of \nlaw). Nonetheless, Court will next address Plaintiffs remaining argument that pursuant to Supreme \nCourt precedent extant at the time of her arrest, the police officer's decision to arrest her was \nobjectively unreasonable. \nPlaintiff argues that in 1995 the Supreme Court specifically held that anonymous pamphlets \nare protected by the First Amendment.  See Mcintyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 \n(1995).  A careful analysis of Mcintyre reveals that the Supreme Court held invalid a statute \nprohibiting  the  distribution  of anonymous  political  campaign  pamphlets  which  discussed \ngovernmental issues.  See id. at 357.  In contrast, the instant case does not involve mere political \npamphleteering or discussion of governmental issues. See id. at 345-46 (noting the exacting scrutiny \nthe victim was within the class delineated in this section. \n5 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 6 of 9(cid:10)\nto which limitations on political speech must be subjected).  Consequently, Mcintyre does not \nprovide the \"bright line\" necessary to establish that Defendant's arrest of Plaintiff was objectively \nunreasonable. \nPlaintiff also points to Talley v.  California,  362 U.S. 60 (1960), Lewis v.  City of New \nOrleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974), R.A. V. v. City ofS t. Paul. 505 U.S. 377 (1992) and Houston v. Hill, \n482  U.S.  451  (1987),  all  of which  held  that  laws  criminalizing  abusive  language  were \nunconstitutional. However, these cases are all distinguishable from the instant case in that none of \nthem deals directly with ordinances proscribing hateful and contemptuous speech contained in an \nanonymous pamphlet distributed in a public school. \nFirst, Talley involved the Supreme Court's striking down as overbroad an ordinance which \nbarred the distribution of all anonymous handbills in any place under all circumstances.  See 362 \nU.S. at 63-64. In holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional, the Court noted that the ordinance \ndid not limit its application to handbills that were obscene, promoted unlawful conduct or in any \nother respect.  In contrast, §836.11 does not prohibit all anonymous handbills in any place under all \ncircumstances but rather limits its application to those which expose individuals or religious groups \nto contempt or hatred. \nSecond,  both  Lewis  and  Houston  involved  ordinances  prohibiting  abusive  language, \nincluding curse words, toward police officers during performance of their official duties. See Lewis, \n415  U.S.  at  132; Houston, 482  U.S.  at 455.  In holding the ordinances overbroad, and  thus \nunconstitutional, the Court reasoned that the ordinances could be applied to more than just \"fighting \nwords, which are not protected under the cloak of the First Amendment, but also to a substantial \namount of protected speech. See Lewis, 415 U.S. at (defining \"fighting words\" as those which inflict \n6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 7 of 9(cid:10)\ninjury or incite a breach of the peace); Houston, 482 U.S. at 462, 466-67 (noting that arrests under \nthe ordinance will be typically made in one-on-one situations where the only witnesses are the \nofficer and the person arrested and convictions will occur solely on the officer's testimony).  In \ncontrast,  §836.11  does  not broadly proscribe speech but  rather is  specifically  limited  in  its \napplication to anonymous pamphleteering tending to expose any individual or religious group \"to \nhatred, contempt ridicule or obloquy.\" \nFinally, R.A. V.  involved a St. Paul, Minnesota ordinance which made it a criminal offense \nto place on private or public property a symbol which aroused anger or alarm on the basis ofrace, \ncolor, creed or religion.  See 505 U.S. at 380.  The Court recognized that it was bound by the \nMinnesota Supreme Court's holding that in proscribing speech that aroused anger or alarm the \nordinance reached only speech that constituted \"fighting words.\" See id. at 381. However, the Court \nreasoned that such a limitation did not save the ordinance because the ordinance proscribed only \ncertain types of\"fighting words,\" specifically those that aroused anger or alarm on the basis of race, \ncolor creed, religion or gender.  See id. at 391.  In striking down the ordinance, the Supreme Court \n. \nstated that laws regulating \"fighting words\" must operate across the board and may not classify and \nban only certain types of \"fighting words,\" for instance only those directed against others on a \ndiscriminatory basis. See 505 U.S. at 381,391.  In contrast, §836.11 is not limited in its application \nto a certain subclass of speech that exposes one to hatred or riducule but by its express terms applies \nto any such speech directed to any person or religious group regardless of its discriminatory nature. 4 \n4As discussed above, to the extent Plaintiff points to R.A. V. to argue that Defendant \nAlexander should have known his arrest of Plaintiff under §775.085, Florida's hate crime statute, \nwas objectively unreasonable because the statute was unconstitutional, the Court disagrees.  See \nStalder 630 So.2d at 1075 (discussing R.A. V and upholding the constitutionality of §775.085). \n7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 8 of 9(cid:10)\nIn short, a careful analysis ofthe case law relied upon by Plaintiff does not establish any type \nof\"bright line\" law regarding anonymous distribution of pamphlets containing contemptuous and \nhateful speech directed toward any individual or religious group.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640 \n(requiring the law to develop in such a concrete and factually similar context to make it obvious to \na reasonable government actor that his actions violate the law).  Moreover, those authorities make \nclear that the contours of the First Amendment right that Plaintiff alleges Defendant Alexander \nviolated were not sufficiently clear when Plaintiff was arrested, and thus the alleged unlawfulness \nof Defendant Alexander's actions is not apparent. See Post v. City ofF ort Lauderdale. 7 F .3d 1552, \n1557 (11th Cir. 1993), modified 14 F.3d 583 (11th Cir. l994)(\"The line between lawful and unlawful \nconduct is often vague. Harlow's 'clearly establish' standard demands that a bright line be crossed. \nThe line is not found in abstractions-to act reasonably, ...,  and so on-but in studying how these \nabstractions have been applied in concrete circumstances.\"). \nAccordingly, viewing the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Defendant \nAlexander is entitled to the protection of qualified immunity, and Defendant Alexander's Motion \nto Dismiss is granted.  Based on the foregoing, it is hereby \nORDERED  AND  ADJUDGED  that  Defendant  Alexander's  Motion  to  Dismiss  is \nGRANTED and the Complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to Defendant Alexander. \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this  / {) day of April, 2000. \n-BEN AGES \nUNITED STAT  DISTRICT JUDGE \ncopies provided: \ncounsel of record \n8 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 83     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/11/2000     Page 9 of 9(cid:10)\n9 ",

Of fL.l. · MIAMI \n/ \nOMNIBUS ORDER \nTHIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Miami Dade County's Motion to Dismiss and for \nFinal Summary Judgment, filed April6, 2000, Plaintiffs Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, \nfiled April 19, 1999, Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to File Plaintiffs Supplemental Affidavit Nunc \nPro Tunc to May 25, 1999, or, in the Alternative, to Rule that the Supplemental Affidavit was \nAuthorized to be Filed, filed June 16, 1999 and Defendant's Motion to Accept Supplemental \nAffidavit, filed July 2, 1999. \nTHE COURT has considered the Motions, the pertinent portions of the record and is \nothetwise fully advised in the premises.  On February 19, 1999, Plaintiff filed the three count \nComplaint alleging that Defendants Michael Alexander (\"Alexander\"), Miami Dade County (the \n\"County\") and the Miami Dade County School Board violated her First and Fourth Amendment \nrights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 in arresting and strip searching her and seeking a \ndeclaration that the Florida statute under which she was arrested is unconstitutional.  Plaintiff and \nthe County have filed cross Motions for Summary Judgment as to the constitutionality of the \nCounty's policy concerning strip searches and thus the constitutionality of the strip search \nconducted upon Plaintiff pursuant to said policy. \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 2 of 16(cid:10)\nFACTS \nThe undisputed, material facts are as follows: \nOn February 23, 1998, Plaintiff, an adult female student at Killian High School in Miami, \nFlorida, was arrested for violation of Fla. Stat. §§ 836.11 and 775.085 1 for her participation in \nthe creation and distribution of an anonymous pamphlet entitled \"First Amendment\" (the \n\"Pamphlet\").  County's Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion \nfor Final Summary Judgment (\"Statement\") at~ 1; Complaint/A  rrest Affidavit.  The Pamphlet \ncontains sketches, including a picture ofKillian's principal, Mr. Dawson, with a dart drawn \nthrough his head and essays, including one in which the author wonders what would happen if he \nshot certain fellow students, as well as Mr. Dawson.  See Pamphlet; Deposition of John Galardi \nat p. 8, 10. \nUpon her arrest, Plaintiff was transported to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional \nFacility (\"TGK\") where she was booked and strip searched pursuant to the County's \nDepartmental Standard Operating Procedure (\"DSOP\") 11-022.  In pertinent part, DSOP 11-022 \nprovides that \"newly arrested felons ... will be completely strip searched by a correctional \nofficer as part of the intake procedures prior to being assigned to any  general population \n1S  ection 836.11 provides, in pertinent part, that it shall be a misdemeanor of the first \ndegree \"to print, publish, distribute or cause to be printed, published or distributed by any means, \nor in any manner whatsoever, any publication, ...p amphlet, ...o r other printed material which \ntends to expose any individual ... to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy unless clearly printed \nthereon [is]. .. the true name and post office address of the person, ... or organization causing \nthe same to be printed, published or distributed.\" Fla. Stat. § 836.11(1)(a), (2).  Section 775.085 \nreclassifies a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony if the commission of the misdemeanor \nevidences prejudice based on, inter alia, race, color, ancestry or ethnicity.  Fla. Stat. § \n775.085(1)(a)(2). \n2 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 3 of 16(cid:10)\nunit/cell. ...\"   DSOP ll-022(D)(5)(a).  Consistent with DSOP I 1-022's procedures for \nconducting the strip search of female arrestees, Plaintiff was required to completely disrobe; to \nopen her mouth exposing her tongue; to lift her breasts exposing the area underneath; to squat \nand cough; and to bend over exposing her buttocks.  Affidavit of Liliana Cuesta (\"Cuesta Aff.\") \nat~ 7.  See also DSOP 11-022 (III)(D)(2)(a)-(h).  After the conclusion ofthe strip search, \nPlaintiff was placed in a holding cell with five to seven other women, some of whom had also \nbeen arrested for felony offenses.  Supplemental Affidavit of Liliana Cuesta (\"Cuesta Supp. \nAff.\") at ~3; Deposition of Liliana Cuesta (\"Cuesta Depo.\") at p. 104-105. \nJoseph Zappia (\"Zappia\"), Captain of the Reception and Diagnostic Bureau of the \nCounty's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, explains that arrestees are not housed at \nTGK but instead are only temporarily detained there for transportation to either the Pretrial \nDetention Center or the Women's Detention Center.  Consequently, while at TGK, arrestees are \nnot assigned to a general population unit or cell.  Affidavit of Joseph Zappia (\"Zappia Aff.\") at~ \n4.  Contrary to this procedure, Plaintiff was never placed in a general population cell because her \nbond was posted before she could be transported to the Pretrial Detention Center or the Women's \nDetention Center.  Cuesta Supp. Aff. at~ 5; Cuesta Depo. at 106.2 \nLEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is authorized only when the moving party meets its burden of \ndemonstrating that \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, \ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \n2 Zappia further explained that felony arrestees are strip searched at the commencement of \nthe intake process at TGK to provide maximum security to the staff and other arrestees as well as \nto address the significant security concerns relating to transporting arrestees who may be in \npossession of contraband.  ld. at~~ 5,6. \n3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 4 of 16(cid:10)\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.  See Adickes \nv. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970).  TheAdickes Court explained that when \nassessing whether the movant has met this burden, the court should view the evidence and all \nfactual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  See \nAdickes, 398 U.S. at 157; Poole v. Country Club of Columbus, Inc., 129 F .3d 551, 553 (1 ph Cir. \n1997)( citing Adickes). \nThe party opposing the motion may not simply rest upon mere allegations or denials of \nthe pleadings; after the moving party has met its burden of coming forward with proof of the \nabsence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party must make a sufficient \nshowing to establish the existence of an essential element to that party's case, and on which that \nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrell, 4 77 U.S. 317 ( 1986); \nBarfield v. Brierton, 883 F.2d 923,933 (11th Cir. 1989). \nIf the record presents factual issues, the Court must not decide them; it must deny the \nmotion and proceed to trial.  See Environmental Defense Fund v. Marsh, 651 F.2d 983, 991 (5th \nCir. 1981 ).  Summary judgment may be inappropriate even where the parties agree on the basic \nfacts, but disagree about the inferences that should be draw from these facts.  See Lighting \nFixture & Elec. Supply Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., 420 F.2d 1211, 1213 (5th Cir. 1969).  If \nreasonable minds might differ on the inferences arising from undisputed facts, the n the Court \nshould deny summary judgment.  See Impossible Electronics Techniques, Inc. v.  Wackenhut \nProtective Sys. Inc., 669 F.2d 1026, 1031 (5th Cir. 1982).  See also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)(\"[T]he dispute about a material fact is 'genuine,' ... if the \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\"). \n4 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\nMoreover, the party opposing a motion for summary judgment need not respond to it with \nevidence unless and until the movant has properly supported the motion with sufficient evidence. \nSee Adickes, 398 U.S. at 160.  The moving party must demonstrate that the facts underlying all \nthe relevant legal questions raised by the pleadings or otherwise are not in dispute, or else \nsummary judgment will be denied notwithstanding that the nonmoving party has introduced no \nevidence whatsoever.  See Brunswick Corp. v.  Vineberg, 370 F.2d 605,611-12 (51 Cir. 1967). \nh \nThe Court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the \nnonmoving party.  See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. \nIn resolving multiple motions for summary judgment, the Court will construe the facts in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant when the parties' factual statements conflict or \ninferences are required.  See Barnes v. Southwest Forest Indus., 814 F.2d 607, 609 (ll'h Cir. \n1987). \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes the parties' agreement  that the issue before the Court \nis whether a correctional facility may constitutionally require that all newly arrested felons be \nsubjected to a strip search prior to being assigned to general population, and thus whether DSOP \n11-022 is constitutional.  In the Complaint, as well as in her Motion for Summary Judgment, \nPlaintiff contends that the strip search to which she was subjected and the policy pursuant to \nwhich it was conducted, is unconstitutional as it violates her Fourth Amendment right to be free \nfrom unreasonable search.  The County presses several arguments in opposition.  First, the \nCounty argues that the strip search of Plaintiff does not implicate the Fourth Amendment. \nSecond, the County argues that even if the Fourth Amendment applies, Plaintiff's Fourth \n5 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\nAmendment rights have not been violated as Plaintiffs arrest and custody was lawful and the \nsubsequent search was reasonable. \nApplicability of the Fourth Amendment \nThe County first argues that strip searches do not implicate and therefore should not be \nanalyzed under the Fourth Amendment but rather under the Due Process Clause.  In support, the \nCounty points to Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S.  I (1985); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 \n( 1984) and Jones v. Diamond, 636 F .2d 1364 ( Yh Cir. 1981 ). \nThe County cites to Garner for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment addresses \nonly seizures incident to an arrest.  The County contends, therefore, that no logical reason exists \nto extend the Fourth Amendment to searches, strip or otherwise, which are not conducted \nincident to an arrest. However, a careful reading of Garner reveals that it neither articulates nor \nfairly implies the claimed proposition.  The Gamer Court merely stated that \"there can be no \nquestion that apprehension by the use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness \nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Garner, 471 U.S. at 6.  Thus, the Court is unpersuaded \nthat the Supreme Court's certain application of the Fourth Amendment to seizures through the \nuse of deadly force necessarily implies that the Supreme Court views the Fourth Amendment as \napplying only to seizures, or searches, incident to arrest. \nAdditionally, the County points to the Hudson Court's pronouncement that the  \"Fourth \nAmendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the \nprison cell.\" The County's reliance on Hudson is misplaced.  Plaintiff is not asserting a \nreasonable expectation of privacy or a Fourth Amendment violation with respect to a search of \nher cell and its contents, as did the plaintiff in Hudson.  See Hudson, 468 U.S. at 526 (finding it \n6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\ndifficult to reconcile a privacy right of inmates in their cells with the concept of incarceration and \nthe objectives ofpenal institutions).  Rather, Plaintiff is asserting such an expectation as to her \nbody.  As the Eleventh Circuit made clear in Justice v.  City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th \nCir. 1992), a case involving a Fourth Amendment challenge to a strip search, it is axiomatic that \npeople harbor a reasonable expectation of privacy in their \"private parts.\" See Justice, 961 F.2d \nat 191.  Consequently, Hudson is not dispositive of the Plaintiffs claim that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to insure that she is free from an unreasonable intrusion upon her body.  See \nid. (noting the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment as entitling one to be \nfree from unreasonable intrusion wherever there is a reasonable expectation of privacy)( citing \nTerry v.  Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)). \nFinally, the County cites to Diamond arguing that the Fifth Circuit has interpreted Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), a Supreme Court case involving, inter alia, the constitutionality of \nvisual body cavity searches, as holding that '\"pretrial detainees' rights are to be determined by \nthe Due Process Clause.\"  Although the undersigned agrees that Diamond so interpreted Bell, the \nundersigned disagrees that such interpretation should inform the analysis in this case.  Diamond, \nlike that portion of Bell on which it relied, involved a constitutional challenge to correctional \nfacility conditions and restrictions that implicated punishment and therefore due process.  See \nDiamond, 636 F.2d at 1376-77 (analyzing claims concerning denial ofvisitation rights).  See \nalso Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-36.3  Moreover, a careful reading of Bell reveals that the Supreme \n3  The record is devoid of any evidence that the purpose of Plaintiff's strip search was \npunishment or was conducted in such a way as to constitute punishment.  Plaintiffs own \ndescription of the search reveals that it was consistent with DSOP 11-022.  Cf Cuesta Aff. at ~ 7 \nand DSOP 11-022(IV)(D)(2).  Moreover, DSOP 11-022 expressly provides that the \"purpose of \n[a] search is prevention, not punishment; therefore the officer's demeanor should be professional \nand not personal.\" DSOP 11-022(1V)(B).  DSOP 11-022 further provides that a \"search will be \n7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 8 of 16(cid:10)\nCourt subjected the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to visual body cavity searches, the \nrelevant claim for purposes of determining the merit of the County's argument, to Fourth \nAmendment analysis.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-60.  Consequently, the Court is unpersuaded \nDiamond disposes of Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment claim.  See, e.g., Justice, 961 F.2d at 191, \n194; Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1387 (M.D. Ala. 1998), aff'd 161 F.3d 22 (11'h \nCir. 1998). \nFourth Amendment Analysis \nLawfulness ofP  laintiff's Custody \nIn arguing the unconstitutionality of DSOP 11-022 and the strip search at issue, Plaintiff \nargues that her arrest and resultant custody were pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and \ntherefore the subsequent strip search was unconstitutional.  Although Plaintiffwas arrested \npursuant to two statutes,§ 836.11 (anonymous pamphleteering subjecting persons to ridicule) \nand§ 775.085 (hate crime statute), Plaintiff does not identify which statute she contends is \nunconstitutional.  Moreover, Plaintiff fails to point to any case law or to provide more than her \nconclusory assertion of \"the statute['s]\" unconstitutionality in support of this argument. \n-\nPlaintiffs mere assertion is insufficient to establish that her arrest and custody were unlawful.  I \nAs a related matter, the Court notes the County's argument that Plaintiffs claim seeking \nI \na declaration that § 836.11 is unconstitutional should be dismissed.  However, the Court is \nunpersuaded that the County's argument, particularly as it is contained in a footnote, is sufficient \nto establish that, as a matter oflaw, Plaintiff is not entitled to the requested declaratory relief.  If \nthe County wishes to press its argument for dismissal, the Court will consider a sufficiently \nconducted in a professional and dignified manner.\" DSOP 11-022(III). \n8 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 9 of 16(cid:10)\nbriefed motion on the matter. \nReasonableness of the Search \nThus, the sole issue before the Court is the reasonableness of DSOP 11-022 procedures \nand the strip search conducted upon Plaintiff.  In determining the constitutionality of the \nCounty's policy and the strip search at issue, the Court finds that the balancing test set out by the \nSupreme Court in Bell governs its decision.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558. \nIn Bell, the Supreme Court held that constitutional analysis of such searches entails a \nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of the personal rights that the \nparticular search entailed.  See id. at 559.  In this regard, the Supreme Court instructed that courts \nshould consider the following factors: a) the scope of the particular intrusion; b) the manner in \nwhich it was conducted; c) the place in which it was conducted; and d) the justification for \ninitiating it.  See id. \nScope, Manner and Place oft he Search \nPlaintiff does not address and therefore appears to concede that the first three factors \narticulated in Bell weigh in favor of finding DSOP 11-022 and the strip search conducted upon \nPlaintiff constitutional.  Plaintiff focuses her argument on the allegedly insufficient justification \nfor strip searching under DSOP 11-022.  Nevertheless, an analysis of the facts of this case under \nthe first three factors confirms that the scope, manner and place in which the strip search at issue \nwas conducted does not offend the Fourth Amendment. \nSpecifically, with respect to the scope of searches conducted pursuant to DSOP 11-022 \nand thus Plaintiffs search, the Court finds such scope reasonable.  DSOP 11-022 limits the scope \nof the search of a newly arrested felon to a visual inspection ofthe arrestee's body, albeit \n9 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 10 of 16(cid:10)\nrequiring the arrestee to assume various positions, and does not involve an actual body cavity \nsearch.  See id. at 559-60 (finding visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees reasonable). \nIn making this finding, the Court does not trivialize the humiliation Plaintiff felt upon the \nexperience of disrobing and exposing her body to a stranger for visual inspection.  However, the \nundersigned is unpersuaded that, in this case, the scope of the intrusion is so unreasonable as to \ncall into question the constitutionality of DSOP 11-022.  Further, to find unconstitutionality \nsolely upon the admittedly demeaning nature of strip searching would be to suggest the \nunconstitutionality of all strip searches, a result inconsistent with binding precedent.  See Bell, \n441 U.S. at 558-560 (recognizing the degree of invasion a strip search exacts yet finding visual \nbody cavity searches of pretrial detainees constitutional); Justice, 961 F .2d at 192 (noting the \nhumiliating nature of a strip search yet finding strip search ofj uvenile arrested for loitering and \ntruancy constitutional).4 \nWith respect to the manner and place in which DSOP 11-022 requires officers to conduct \nstrip searches, the Court finds such to be similarly reasonable.  See Justice, 961 F.2d 188 (finding \na strip search performed by a same sex officer, using a room where only the officer and arrestee \nwere present was reasonable as to place and manner).  DSOP 11-022 requires that a strip search \nof an arrestee be conducted in a professional and dignified manner, individually and in an area \ndesigned to provide maximum privacy.  See DSOP ll-022(1V)(D).  Moreover, only a female  I \nofficer may conduct a strip search of a female arrestee.  See DSOP 11-022(111).  The record is \nI, \n4To the extent Plaintiff argues that DSOP I 1-022's requirement ofhaving an arrestee \nremove all of their clothing rather than just remove the outer clothing is unreasonable, the Court \nis unpersuaded that such a difference is of constitutional significance.  See Magill v. Lee County, \n990 F.Supp. 1382, 1390 (M.D. Ala. 1998)(\"The constitutional balancing of the inmate's rights \nand jail's concerns does not necessarily turn on the issue of whether the inmates are allowed to \nwear a bra and panties.\"), aff'd 161 F.3d 22 (11th Cir. 1998). \n10 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 11 of 16(cid:10)\ndevoid of any evidence that the strip search conducted upon Plaintiff was not conducted \nconsistent with these requirements. \nJustification for the Search \nAs noted above, Plaintiffs attack on the constitutionality of the strip search to which she \nwas subjected, and thus DSOP 11-022, centers on whether the search was justified.  Specifically, \nPlaintiff argues that because the officers conducting the search lacked a particularized basis for \nthe search and because DSOP fails to require such a basis but rather authorizes routine strip \nsearching, DSOP 11-022 and the search conducted upon Plaintiff are unconstitutional.  In \nsupport, Plaintiff points to a number of cases from other jurisdictions purportedly holding that \nroutine or blanket policies requiring strip searching are unconstitutional.  A careful analysis of \nthe authorities cited by Plaintiff reveal that they fail to compel a finding of unconstitutionality in \nthe instant case. \nAll of the cases cited by Plaintiff in which the court found the policy and strip search \nunreasonable involved minor, misdemeanor offenses, a fact which clearly drove the respective \ncourts' holdings.5  See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1257 (6'h Cir. 1989)(finding the \nlaw clearly established that a person charged only with a minor traffic offense or nonviolent \noffense may not be strip searched unless there are reasonable grounds); Watt v. City of  I \nRichardson Police Dep 't, 849 F.2d 195 (51h Cir. 1988)(finding strip search of female arrested for  I \nfailure to license dog unreasonable); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2\"d Cir. 1988)(finding strip \nand body cavity search of person arrested for failure to pay parking tickets unconstitutional); \n5ln the interests ofbrevity, the Court will not list all of the cases cited by Plaintiffbut \nnotes the chart of said cases provided at the conclusion of Plaintiffs Cross Motion for Summary \nJudgment and Incorporated Memorandum of Law. \n11 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 12 of 16(cid:10)\nMary Beth G. v. City ofChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 )(7'h Cir. 1983)(finding insubstantial the \nneed for a strip search of female arrestees charged only with misdemeanor offenses).b  Such is \nnot the case here. \nIt is undisputed that DSOP 11-022 requires the strip searching of all newly arrested felons \nat the commencement of the booking process, and it is this policy that Plaintiff attacks.  It is \nequally undisputed that Plaintiff was arrested for a felony offense.  Plaintiff attempts to minimize \nthis fact by characterizing her offense as nothing more than the distribution of an anonymous \npamphlet evincing no more than ordinary adolescent protest.7  Nevertheless, the fact remains that \nPlaintiff was delivered to TGK as a felony arrestee. \nIn addition to pointing to the cases striking down blanket policies that authorized the strip \nsearching of misdemeanor arrestees, Plaintiff points to the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Justice \nto argue that regardless of whether there is a blanket policy regarding strip searches, some \nparticularized determination must be made before a strip search of a felon arrestee may be \nconstitutionally undertaken.  In Justice, the Eleventh Circuit considered the constitutionality of a \nstrip search of a thirteen year-old female arrested for loitering and truancy and who was not \ngoing to be placed in contact with other arrestees but was to be released to her mother.  See \n6In any event, the authority cited by Plaintiff is insufficient to compel this Court to find \nthat DSOP 11-022 policy of strip searchingfelons upon entry into correctional facilities is \nunconstitutional as the cases cited deal almost exclusively with true \"blanket\" policies that \nauthorized the strip searching of persons charged with misdemeanor offenses. \n7 A careful review of the Pamphlet reveals that it was not just a satirical pamphlet \ncontaining ordinary adolescent protest, as Plaintiff would suggest.  Rather, the Pamphlet \ncontained depictions of the contributors' principal with a dart through his head and musings \nabout the consequences of shooting the principal and fellow students.  The Court is not inclined \nto find that Plaintitr s participation in the creation and distribution of such material undercuts the \nCounty's justification for conducting Plaintitrs strip search as the Pamphlet's content reveals a \ncertain indicia of violence. \n12 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 13 of 16(cid:10)\nJustice, 961  F.2d at 190.  The Eleventh Circuit held only that law enforcement may conduct a \nstrip search of a juvenile, even for a minor offense, but they must have reasonable suspicion.  In \nso holding, the court explained that the strip search of a juvenile based on less than probable \ncause 'instinctively gives us the most pause.'  See id., 961  F.2d at 193 (quoting Be//)(emphais \nadded).  The undersigned thus is unpersuaded that Justice's holding extends to prohibit a strip \nsearch of an adult felony arrestee before placement in the general population absent a \nparticularized determination that security in the correctional facility will be compromised.  See \nMagill, 990 F.Supp at 1390 (rejecting the argument that Justice mandated any particularized \ndetermination with respect to adult arrestees who will be placed in contact with other detainees). \nAt this juncture, the Court notes Plaintiffs emphasis on the fact that she was never placed \nin general population but rather was released directly from her holding cell. 8  However, the \nrecord is devoid of any evidence that TGK personnel knew at the time Plaintiff was booked that \nPlaintiff would not be transported thereafter to a general population cell at the Pretrial Detention \nCenter or the Women's Detention Center.  As it happened, Plaintiff was bonded out before she \nwas transported.  The constitutionality ofDSOP 11-022 simply cannot turn on the possibility that \nan arrestee will be bonded out before she is transported and placed in a general population cell. \nTo do so would mandate powers of clairvoyance that the Constitution clearly does not require. \nMoreover, even assuming that TGK personnel knew Plaintiff would never be placed in \ngeneral population, the undisputed record evidence establishes Plaintiff was not placed in a \nprivate cell but was placed in a holding cell with five to seven other arrestees, some of whom had \n8In fact, in her reply memorandum, Plaintiff recharacterizes the issue before the Court as \nwhether the County can constitutionally strip search arrestees without regard to whether they are \nin fact assigned to general population.  See Plaintiffs Reply to County's Response in Opposition \nto Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at p. 2. \n13 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 14 of 16(cid:10)\nalso been arrested for felony offenses.  Thus, Plaintiff was placed in contact with other arrestees \nand there is no evidence that the other arrestees with whom she came in contact were not then \nplaced in general population.  Consequently, the security dangers and concerns inherent in the \nmanagement of correctional facilities were still present and no less serious.  See Magill, 990 \nF.Supp. at 1390 (noting that \"even those who are only placed in a holding cell could pose a \ndanger to themselves, other inmates and the guards.\"). \nThe Court also notes Plaintiffs contention that she represented little if any threat of \nintroducing contraband into the correctional facility because she entered the facility after being \narrested at school (not a drug den) and, like all arrestees, in the custody of police officers. \nHowever, these facts do not undercut the possible security dangers that newly arrested felons \npresent for correctional personnel.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court finds Bell instructive. \nIn upholding the constitutionality of visual body cavity searches of pretrial detainees after \ncontact visits with individuals from outside the institution, the Supreme Court reasoned that such \nsearches were justified to address the serious security dangers inherent in detention facilities.  See \nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, 560.  Certainly, if visual body cavity searches of pretrial detainees after \ncontact visits are justified despite the highly regulated nature of such contact, strip searches of \nnewly arrested felons after unregulated contact in the community at large are justified.  After all, \nnewly arrested felons, no less than detained inmates, pose a potential danger to themselves, other \ninmates and correctional personnel, particularly, where as here, the arrestee's detention may \ninvolve transportation from one facility to another.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 (\"A detention \nfacility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers.  Smuggling of money drugs, \nweapons and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\"); Justice, 961 F.2d at 193 \n14 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 15 of 16(cid:10)\n(recognizing that strip searches are a valuable tool in maintaining security and locating \ncontraband).  Thus, as Bell requires, the scope, place, manner and justification for strip searches \nunder DSOP 11-022 support the constitutionality of the policy. \nReduced to its essence, Plaintiffs argument is that in addition to conducting strip \nsearches that comport with the Bell factors, correctional personnel must make individualized \ndeterminations as to whether the nature of the felony with which each arrestee is charged \nimplicates a security concern for the institution.  The Court is unpersuaded that the Constitution \nmandates this additional requirement.  As other courts have reasoned, allowing correctional \npersonnel to strip search based on the class of offense, specifically felonies, obviates the \nhundreds of individualized determinations that would be necessary absent such a bright line rule. \nSee Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F.Supp. 396 (D. N.J. 1987)(finding that a \"blanket policy\" \ncovering only persons charged with felonies or misdemeanors involving weapons or contraband \nis justified because it is based on a reasonable generalization that such persons are likely to be \nconcealing weapons or contraband); Smith v. Montgomery County, Maryland, 643 F.Supp. 435, \n437 (D. Md. 1986)(noting that the absence of a bright line rule based on the offense requires jail \npersonnel to \"ponder the niceties of Fourth Amendment law every time they admit a potentially \ndangerous inmate into their facility\").  In fact, to the extent the Constitution requires any \nparticularized determination with respect to strip searching an adult felony arrestee who may be \nplaced into a general population unit or cell, a determination of reasonable suspicion is supplied \nby the felony status of the offense.  See Smith, 643 F.Supp. at 438 (approving the determination \nof reasonable suspicion based on the category of the criminal charge). \nIn conclusion, in this case, the Court is convinced that the admittedly significant personal \n15 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 84     Entered on FLSD Docket 04/18/2000     Page 16 of 16(cid:10)\nprivacy intrusion sustained by Plaintiff pursuant to the County's policy of strip searching adult, \nfelony arrestees, when balanced against the reasonableness of the scope, manner and place of the \nsearch as well as the County's legitimate institutional security concerns, was reasonable and thus \nconstitutional.

This  is  a  civil  rights  lawsuit  by  a  person  who  was \nassociated with the  Killian 9's satirical,  political,  and  creative \npublication  \"The  First  Amendment,\"  for  which  association  she  was \nunconstitutionally arrested and  strip searched. \n2.  The  arrest  was  made  pursuant  to  official policy  of  the \nMiami  Dade  County School  Board and violated the rights of plaintiff \nunder  the  First,  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  amendments  to  the  U.S. \nConstitution.  The  strip  search  was  made  pursuant  to  official \npolicy  of  Miami  Dade  County• s  Department  of  Corrections  and \nviolated  the  Fourth Amendment. \nCause  of Action  and  Jurisdiction \n3 .  This  action  arises  under  the  First,  Fourth,  and \nFourteenth Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  Title \n42  U.S.C.  §§  1983  and  1988.  Jurisdiction  is  conferred  on  this \ncourt  by  Title  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  and  1343  (3)  and  (4). \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 2 of 10(cid:10)\nParties \n4.  Plaintiff Liliana Cuesta  was  a  student  at Killian Senior \nHigh  School  and a  contributor  to  the  \"First Amendment\"  at  the  time \nshe  was  unlawfully  arrested by Defendant  Alexander. \n5.  At  the  time  of  the  actions  that  give  rise  to  filing  of \nthis  complaint,  Defendant  Michael  Alexander  was  an  officer of  the \nMiami  Dade  County Schools  Police Department.  In  that capacity,  he \narrested  plaintiff  and  charged  her  with  violating  Fla.  Stat. \n836.11,  a  facially  unconstitutional  statute.  At  all  material \ntimes,  he  was  acting under  color  of  state  law  and  pursuant  to  the \npolicies and  practices of  the  Dade  County  School  Board. \n6.  Defendant  School  Board  of  Miami  Dade  County,  Florida  is \nresponsible for the management,  control,  operation,  administration, \nand  supervision  of  all  public  schools  in  Dade  County,  Florida \nincluding Killian High.  Its official policy mandates or encourages \nreferring a  student  for  arrest whenever  a  crime  is thought  to have \nbeen  committed  on  school  property.  Defendant  Alexander  arrested \nPlaintiff pursuant  to  such  policy. \n7.  Defendant  Miami  Dade  County is the municipal  entity under \nFlorida law  that owns  and/or operates the Dade  County Department  of \nCorrections  [DOC]  and its pretrial detention facilities,  including \nTurner Guilford  Knight  [TGK]  .  Pursuant  to official policy  of  the \nDOC,  plaintiff  Cuesta  was  strip  searched  upon  booking  into  TGK \nDetention  Center  because  she  had  been  arrested  for  an  alleged \nfelony.  There was  no particularized suspicion that a  search of  her \nnude  person  and  bodily cavities  was  required  for  purposes  of  jail \n2 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 3 of 10(cid:10)\nsecurity. \nStatement  of  Facts \n8.  In February of  1998,  the  Killian  9  wrote poems,  sketches \nessays  and  cartoons,  including  satirical  writings  and  lampoons  of \nauthority  figures  for  inclusion  in  \"The  First  Amendment.\"  The \npamphlet was published anonymously,  without attribution of any item \nor  entry  to  any  individual. \n9.  On  Friday,  February  20,  1998,  some  of  the  Killian  9 \ndistributed copies of  that year•s  edition of  \"The  First Amendment\" \nto other  students  at  Killian Senior High  School. \n10.  Principal  Timothy  Dawson  also  received  a  copy  of  the \npamphlet  and  in the words  of  the  police  incident  report  \"conducted \nan  investigation.\"  He  set  out  to  ascertain  the  identities  of  all \nstudent  contributors  to  that  year•s  pamphlet. \n11.  Mr.  Dawson,  pursuant  to  Dade  County  School  Board  Rule \n6Gx13-5D-1.08  at  pp.  9-12,  \"refer[red]  criminal  acts  to  the  Dade \nCounty  Public  Schools  Police  and  the  local  police  agency  for \nappropriate  legal  action.\"  He  summoned  both  Dade  County  Schools \nPolice  and  Miami  Dade  County police  officers  to  his  office. \n12.  He  instructed  Dade  County  Schools  Police  to  remove  the \nstudents,  one  by  one,  from  their classrooms,  and  to  bring  them  to \nhis office.  He  confronted each with the pamphlet,  demanded  to know \nthe  extent  of  that  student•s  involvement  in  its publication,  and \nthreatened  each  with  arrest  by  school  police  in  the  event  the \nstudent  failed  to  confess. \n13.  During  interrogation,  each  of  the  Killian  9  wrote  a \n3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 4 of 10(cid:10)\nstatement detailing his/her involvement  in the pamphlet.  Defendant \nAlexander,  acting pursuant to the direction or encouragement of Mr. \nDawson,  arrested  the  students,  read  them  Miranda  rights,  took \nfurther  statements,  and  arranged for  their transport  to  jail.  The \nminor  children were  taken  to  Miami  Dade  County  Juvenile  Detention \nCenter.  The  18  year-olds  were  incarcerated at  TGK  jail. \n14.  Plaintiff  and  the  other  studentS  were  charged  with  a \nmisdemeanor  violation  of  Fla.  Stat.  836.11,  which  prohibits \nanonymous  publication  if  it  11tends  to  expose  any  individual  or \nreligious  group  to  hatred,  contempt,  ridicule  or  obloquy. 11  To \nelevate  that  alleged  offense  to  a  felony  charge  permitting \nwarrantless arrest,  Defendant  Alexander  enhanced each charge under \nFla.  Stat.  775.085,  Florida's 11hate crime\"  statute,  which prohibits \ncommitting  an  offense  in  a  manner  evidencing  racial  or  other \nprejudice.  The  Offense  Incident  Reports  and  Complaint/Arrest \nAffidavits  filed by Defendant  Alexander  identify Timothy Dawson  as \nthe  victim  of  the  alleged  offenses. \n15.  All criminal charges against  Plaintiff and other members \nof  the  Killian  9  were  dismissed  by  the  Dade  State  Attorney's \nOffice.  In dismissing,  the State Attorney's Office issued a  public \nstatement  acknowledging  that  the  statute  under  which  the  students \nwere  arrested  is unconstitutional  and  unenforceable. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nCount  I:  First Amendment  Violations \n[Defendants:  Alexander  and  the  Dade  County  School  Board] \n4 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 5 of 10(cid:10)\n16.  Defendant Alexander violated Plaintiff's First Amendment \nrights  of  Free  Speech  and  Free  Press  in  arresting  her  under  a \nfacially  invalid  statute,  Fla.  Stat.  836 .11,  that  purports  to \nprohibit contemptuous anonymous  pamphleteering against individuals \nand  religious  organizations.  Anonymous  pamphleteering  has  a  long \nand  honorable  tradition  in  America  predating  the  founding  of  the \nRepublic  and  is  protected by  the  First Amendment. \n17.  WritiJig that  \"tends to expose any individual or religious \ngroup  to  hatred,  contempt,  ridicule  or  obloquy\"  is  essential  to \npolitical satire and  other forms  of  criticism and  lies at  the  core \nof what  is protected by  the  First Amendment.  A statute purporting \nto  criminalize  such  writing  is  facially  invalid  for  overbreadth. \n18.  That  Fla.  Stat.  836.11  violated  the  First  Amendment  was \nclearly  established  law  of  which  a  reasonable  law  enforcement \nofficer would  have  known.  Anonymous  pamphlets  were  declared to be \nprotected  by  the  First  Amendment  in  Mcintyre  v.  Ohio  Elections \nComm'n,  514  U.S.  334  (1995)  and  prior  cases.  Laws  criminalizing \nabusive  or  contemptuous  speech  were  stricken  in  Lewis  v.  City  of \nNew  Orleans,  408  U.S.  913  (1972)  and  415  U.S.  130  (1974)  [Lewis  II] \nand  Houston  v.  Hill,  482  U.S.  451  (1987).  Further,  Fla.  Stat. \n836.11  was  enacted in 1945;  but  not  a  single  conviction appears  in \nthe  Southern  Reporter.  Alexander's  arrest  of  Plaintiff  was \nobjectively unreasonable. \n19.  In violating Plaintiff's rights under the First Amendment \nto  the  United  States  Constitution,  Defendants  directly  and \nproximately caused Plaintiff to suffer unlawful  arrest,  detention, \n5 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 6 of 10(cid:10)\nsearch of  her person,  anguish,  embarrassment  and  humiliation. \nCount  II:  Fourth  Amendment  Violations--Unlawful  Arrest \n[Defendants  Alexander  and  Dade  County  School  Board] \n20.  Plaintiff  repeats  the  averments  of  ~~  1-15  above. \n21.  Defendants  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment  right  of \nPlaintiff to be  free of unlawful  seizure of  the person in arresting \nher  without  probable  cause  to  believe  that  a  valid  complaint  of \ncrime  had  been  lodged  by  Mr.  Dawson.  But  for  application  of  the \nfacially  invalid  Fla.  Stat.  836.11,  Defendant  could  not  have \narrested Plaintiff. \n22.  That  there  can be  no  probable  cause  to arrest  for  a  non \nexistent  crime  was  clearly  established  law  of  which  a  reasonable \nlaw enforcement  officer would have  known.  That  the  reported crime \nwas  non-existent  follows  from  the  fact  that  Fla.  Stat.  836.11  is \nunconstitutional for the reasons  stated above  in ~~16-18, which are \nhere  incorporated  by  reference.  Alexander's  arrest  of  Plaintiff \nwas  objectively unreasonable. \n23.  Irrespective  of  whether  a  reasonable  law  enforcement \nofficer  could  have  concluded  that  Fla.  Stat.  836.11  was  valid, \nDefendant  Alexander  still could  not  have  arrested Plaintiff  for  a \nmisdemeanor  not  committed  in  his  presence  without  a  warrant  of \narrest.  He  \"produced\"  putative  grounds  for  warrantless  arrest  by \ncharging the hate  crimes  felony  enhancement  of  Fla.  Stat.  775.085. \nThe  resulting  arrest  for  felony-level  hate  speech  was  also  and \nindependently  objectively  unreasonable,  hate  speech  laws  having \nbeen  declared  facially  invalid  in R.A.V.  v.  City of  St.  Paul,  505 \n6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 7 of 10(cid:10)\nu.s.  377  (1992). \n24.  In  violating  Plaintiff 1s  rights  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  Defendants  Alexander \nand  Dade  County  School  Board  directly  and  proximately  caused \nPlaintiff  to  suffer  unlawful  arrest,  detention,  anguish, \nembarrassment  and  humiliation. \nCount  III:  Fourth Amendment Violation- -Illegal Search of the Person \n[Defendant:  Miami  Dade  County] \n25.  Plaintiff repeats  the  averments  of  ~~ 1-15  above. \n26.  Upon  being  booked  into  the  TGK  detention  facility, \nPlaintiff  Cuesta  was  ordered  to  remove  her  clothing  in  order  to \npermit  jail  personnel  to  examine  her  bodily  orifices.  This \nintrusive  search  was  not  justified  by  the  nature  of  the  alleged \ncrime  for which  she  was  arrested and  was  not  justified by probable \ncause  or  particularized  suspicion  that  she  was  concealing \ncontraband,  weapons  or  anything  threatening  jail security. \n27.  The  strip  search  of  Plaintiff  Cuesta  was  carried  out \npursuant  to  the  established  policy  and  practice  of  Miami  Dade \nCounty  in  booking  persons  arrested  for  felonies,  as  stated  in \nMemorandum  #11-022,  March  15,  1988,  issued  by  Kevin  S.  Hickey, \nDeputy  Director,  Dade  County  Corrections  and  Rehabilitation \nDepartment,  p. 3:  11Newly  arrested  felons  will  be  completely \nstrip searched by a  certified Correctional  Officer  as  part  of  the \nintake  procedures  [emphasis  in  the  original]  The  written \nn \npolicy was  supported  by  customary practice  at  TGK. \n28.  In violating  rights under the Fourth Amendment \nPlaintiff~ \n7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 8 of 10(cid:10)\nto  the  United  States  Constitution,  Defendant  directly  and \nproximately  caused  Plaintiff  to  suffer  an  unlawful  search  of  the \nbody,  anguish,  embarrassment  and  humiliation. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  averments,  Plaintiff \nrequests  the  following  relief: \na.  Under  Count  I,  a  declaratory  judgment  under  28  USC  §2201 \nthat  Fla.  Stat.  §836 .11  is  unconstitutional  on  its  face  and  a \njudgment  for damages  against Defendant Alexander and the Miami  Dade \nCounty  School  Board; \nb.  Under  Count  II,  a  judgment  for  compensatory  damages \nagainst Defendants Alexander and the Miami  Dade  County School Board \nfor  unreasonable  seizure  of  the  person  of  Plaintiff; \nc.  Under  Count  III,  a  judgment  against Defendant  Miami  Dade \nCounty  awarding  her  compensatory  damages  for  the  unreasonable \nsearch of  her  body  at  TGK; \nd.  Under  all counts,  an award  of  costs including  reasonable \nattorneys•  fees  pursuant  to  42  USC  §1988  against  each  Defendant \njointly  and  severally,  or  apportioned  in  the  discretion  of  the \ncourt;  and \ne.  such  other  relief  as  the  Court  deems  proper  and  just. \n;/air; \nDated: \nPLAINTIFF  LILIANA  CUESTA: \nRespectfullly  submitted, \n8 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 1     Entered on FLSD Docket 02/22/1999     Page 9 of 10(cid:10)\nitimoo~tM~ \n3050  Jefferson  St. \nCoconut  Grove,  Fl.  33133 \nTel:  305-858-2436 \nFax:  305-858-6336 \nFla.

McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421-22, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 1848-49, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 \n( 1969), and may grant the motion only when \"it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove \nno set of facts in support ofhis claim which could entitle him to relief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. \n41,45-46,78 S.Ct. 99, 102,2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Bradberry v. Pinnellas County, 789 F.2d 1513, \n1515 (11th Cir. 1986).  Moreover, the Court must, \"at this stage of the litigation, ... accept [the \nplaintiff's] allegations as true.\"  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 \nL.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Stevens v. Dept. ofH  ealth and Human Services, 901 F .2d 1571, 1573 (II th~   \n\nCase 1:99-cv-00517-UU     Document 48     Entered on FLSD Docket 06/29/1999     Page 2 of 2(cid:10)\n1990). Thus, the inquiry focuses on whether the challenged pleadings \"give the defendant fair notice \nofwhat the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" Conley, 355 U.S. at 47. \nThe Defendant moves to dismiss the Complaint on the ground that the \"Complaint on its face \nshows that there is no policy or practice of the School Board to violate Plaintiffs First or Fourth \nAmendment rights.\" Viewing the Complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, as the Court \nmust do at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court finds that the Complaint alleges a cause of action \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 including allegations that the Plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated \npursuant to the School Board's policy.  Moreover, at the motion to dismiss stage, it would be \npremature for the Court to determine whether the Plaintiff can provide a factual basis to support the \nallegations relating to the Defendant's policy of \"referring a student for arrest whenever a crime is \nthought to have been committed on school property.\"  (Complaint at ,6). \nAccordingly, it is hereby \nORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this #day of June, 1999. \n0-BENAGES \nDISTRICT JUDGE \ncopies provided: \nCounsel ofRecord ",

      "text": "285 F.3d 962 (2002)\nLiliana CUESTA, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nSCHOOL BOARD OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, Michael Alexander, Miami-Dade\nCounty, Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 00-16086.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.\nMarch 14, 2002.\n996634 *963*964 Steven Wisotsky, Coconut Grove, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellant.\nAna Isabel Segura, James J. Allen, Miami, FL, for Defendants-Appellees.\nBefore CARNES, BARKETT and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges.\nKRAVITCH, Circuit Judge:\nIn this appeal, we consider two issues: whether a school board is liable for an allegedly unlawful arrest stemming\nfrom a \"zero tolerance\" policy towards school related violent crime and whether a county is liable for an allegedly\nunconstitutional strip search of the arrestee. With respect to the first issue, we conclude that a school board\ncannot be held liable for allegedly unlawful arrests that result from a policy that merely calls on school officials to\nreport criminal behavior. With respect to the second issue, we conclude that there was reasonable suspicion to\nstrip search the arrestee, and therefore the search was constitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment to both defendants.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn the morning of February 20, 1998, Liliana Cuesta and eight other students at Killian Senior High School\n965 distributed an *965 anonymous pamphlet, entitled \"First Amendment,\" on school grounds. The pamphlet's cover\nfeatured a graphic of Timothy Dawson, the school's principal, with a dart through his head. The pamphlet\nincluded several poems, cartoons and essays. Among the essays was one in which the author \"wondered what\n[1]\nwould happen\" if he shot the principal, the school's teachers, or other students.  The same essay made\nreference to \"an African disease\" and \"immigrants who can't talk a fucking word of English.\" Cartoons in the\npamphlet depicted violent and sexual activity.\nThe following Monday, Principal Dawson discovered the identities of the nine students who created and\ndistributed the pamphlet and called them to his office. Because he feared for his safety, Dawson requested that\nboth Miami-Dade Police Officer John Galardi and Division of School Police Officer Michael Alexander assist with\nthe questioning of the students. Each of the students admitted having been involved in the production and\ndistribution of the pamphlet. Dawson told the police officers that if any crime had been committed, he wished to\nprosecute as far as the law would allow. After examining a book of Florida statutes, Officer Alexander concluded\nthat the students had violated Fla. Stat. § 836.11, a misdemeanor that criminalizes the anonymous distribution of\n[2]\npublications that \"expose any individual or any religious group to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy.\"  He\nalso believed that, given the racially motivated content of the pamphlet, the crime could be enhanced to a felony\n[3]\nunder Fla. Stat. § 775.085, a law that allows the enhancement of a crime that \"evidences prejudice.\"  Alexander\nspoke with an Assistant State Attorney on the telephone, who conferred with colleagues and agreed that there\nwas probable cause to arrest under § 836.11 and that the crime could be enhanced to a felony under § 775.085.\nThe students were arrested and transported to either the Juvenile Assessment Center or the Turner Guilford\nKnight Correctional Facility (\"TGK\"), depending on whether they were over eighteen years old.\n\nCuesta, who was over eighteen years old, was taken to TGK. Cuesta was booked and strip searched pursuant to\n966 a Metro-Dade County policy requiring the strip *966 search of all newly arrested felons. The strip search,\nconducted by a female corrections officer in a closed room, required Cuesta to completely disrobe; to lift her\nbreasts exposing the area underneath; and to squat down and cough while exposing her buttocks. After the strip\nsearch was completed, Cuesta was placed in a holding cell with several other women until she was released on\nbond.\nFour days after the arrests, the State Attorney's Office decided not to prosecute any of the students who had\nparticipated in creating and distributing the pamphlet. The State Attorney issued a press release indicating that\nthe decision not to file criminal charges was made because \"recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court\n... render the statute in question unconstitutional and unenforceable.\" In an unrelated case, the Florida Fourth\nDistrict Court of Appeal later declared § 836.11 to be an unconstitutional infringement of the First Amendment. \nFlorida v. Shank, 795 So.2d 1067 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2001).\nCuesta subsequently filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against: (1) The Dade County School Board and\nPolice Officer Michael Alexander, for violating her First and Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully arresting her;\nand (2) Miami-Dade County, for violating her Fourth Amendment rights by subjecting her to an unconstitutional\nstrip search. The district court granted a motion to dismiss by Officer Alexander based on qualified immunity; that\ndecision has not been appealed. The district court then granted summary judgment for both the County and the\nSchool Board. Cuesta appeals those grants of summary judgment.\nII. DISCUSSION\nSummary judgment is granted if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). This court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo,\napplying the same legal standards as the district court. Wolf v. Coca-Cola Co., 200 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th\nCir.2000). We construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty. Arrington v. Cobb County, 139 F.3d 865, 871 (11th Cir.1998).\nA. The Arrest\nA local government body, such as the School Board in this case, is liable under § 1983 \"when execution of a\ngovernment's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be\nsaid to represent official policy, inflicts the injury....\" Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct.\n2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A plaintiff can establish § 1983 liability by identifying that she has been deprived of\nconstitutional rights by either an express policy or a \"widespread practice that, although not authorized by written\nlaw or express municipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom and usage with the\nforce of law.\" Brown v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 923 F.2d 1474, 1481 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotes omitted)\n(quoting City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988)). Cuesta asserts\nthat both the express policy and the custom of the County were responsible for her alleged constitutional\n[4]\ndeprivations.\n967 *967 It is not sufficient for a government body's policy to be tangentially related to a constitutional deprivation.\nThe \"official policy or custom must be the moving force of the constitutional violation in order to establish liability\nof a government body under § 1983.\" Gilmere v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 737 F.2d 894, 901 (11th Cir.1984) (internal\nquotes omitted). A plaintiff \"must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the\ndeprivation of federal rights.\" Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137\nL.Ed.2d 626 (1997). Cuesta asserts that the \"zero tolerance\" policy of the School Board was the \"moving force\"\nbehind her allegedly unconstitutional arrest. A fair reading of the School Board Rules (\"the Rules\"), however,\n[5]\nreveals that they were not the \"moving force\" behind her arrest.\n\nThe zero tolerance policy is made up of three provisions of the School Board Rules (\"the Rules\") and is\nsupplemented by the Code of Student Conduct. Under the Rules, School Police are responsible for \"providing\nassistance\" in \"[t]he prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of the penal laws of this state as the\nviolation occurs on or to the properties of the Dade County Public Schools.\" School Board Rule 6Gx13-4A-1.09\n(Division of School Police-Organization and Responsibilities). The Rules also state that \"[a]ll employees are\nunder an affirmative duty to report any criminal act, and/or disruptive, and/or inappropriate behavior.... All\nviolations of law and incidents of disruptive and/or inappropriate behavior are to be reported in accordance with\nadministrative procedures established by the Superintendent of Schools.\" School Board Rule 6Gx13-4A-1.21.III,\nIV (Responsibilities and Duties). Finally, the Rules state that \"[t]he Board endorses a zero tolerance policy toward\nschool related violent crime.\" School Board Rule 6Gx13-5D-1.08 (Maintenance of Appropriate Student Behavior).\nThe rule endorsing the zero tolerance policy incorporates the Code of Student Conduct by reference. The Code\nof Student Conduct describes the zero tolerance policy as requiring \"school districts to invoke the most severe\nconsequences provided for in the Code of Student Conduct in dealing with students who engage in violent\ncriminal acts ...\" Code of Student Conduct Secondary i (1997). The consequences provided for in the Code of\nStudent Conduct direct individuals to \"[r]efer criminal acts to the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Police and\nthe local police agency for appropriate legal action.\" Id. at 10-13. We do not construe these Rules to be the\n968 \"moving force\" behind Cuesta's arrest; rather, the Rules merely *968 call on school officials to report criminal\nbehavior.\nWe also do not find that the School Board had a custom that was the \"moving force\" behind Cuesta's arrest.\nAccording to Cuesta, School Board Police officers had a widespread customary practice of making arrests for all\nserious on-campus crimes, and therefore the policy that mandates the reporting of criminal behavior directly\ncaused Cuesta's arrest. The facts of this case demonstrate otherwise. Principal Dawson reported the students'\nconduct to Officer Alexander, as is mandated under the policy. He also indicated that he wished to prosecute the\nstudents if they had violated any criminal laws. Officer Alexander, together with Officer Galardi, looked through a\nbook of statutes and found § 836.11. Officer Alexander then called the State Attorney's Office and spoke with\nAssistant State Attorney Carlos Guzman about the possibility of making an arrest under § 836.11, and the\npossibility of enhancing the crime under § 775.085. Guzman discussed the situation with two colleagues at the\nState Attorney's Office, and the three of them concluded that there was probable cause to make an arrest, and\nthat the crime could be enhanced. Only after Guzman conveyed this conclusion to Officer Alexander was an\narrest made. Thus, the facts of Cuesta's arrest demonstrate that reports of serious crimes do not automatically\nlead to arrest-two police officers and three Assistant State's Attorneys considered whether to arrest the students\nafter the conduct was reported. The statistics in the record also indicate that the school police officers exercised\nindependent judgment before arresting. For the school year in which Cuesta was arrested, police officers only\nmade arrests in 14.91% of the incidents reported to them. We therefore perceive no custom leading to Cuesta's\nallegedly unlawful arrest.\nEven in the absence of an express policy or custom, a local government body can be held liable \"for a single act\nor decision of a municipal official with final policymaking authority in the area of the act or decision.\" See \nMcMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1996). Cuesta argues that Principal Dawson was such a final\npolicymaker, and therefore the School Board can be held liable for her allegedly unlawful arrest. It is clear from\nthe record, however, that Dawson has no final policymaking authority to make arrests. As discussed earlier, the\ndecision to arrest was made by Officer Alexander after consultation with the State Attorney's Office. Therefore,\nthe School Board can not be held liable for any constitutional deprivation that might have occurred as a result of\nCuesta's arrest.\nB. The Strip Search\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court concluded that strip\nand visual body cavity searches of arrestees can be constitutionally conducted with less than probable cause. Id.\nat 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Court recognized that \"a detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. As a result, the Court reasoned that \"there must be a `mutual\naccommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of\n\ngeneral application.'\" Id. at 546, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41\nL.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). To assist courts in determining the reasonableness of searches, Bell gives the following\nbalancing test:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\n969 mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing *969 of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the\nscope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating\nit, and the place in which it was conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Cuesta argues that her search was not justified and therefore violated her Fourth\n[6]\nAmendment rights 00she does not challenge the constitutionality of the scope, place, or manner of her strip\n97\nsearch.\nThis court has explained the \"justification\" prong of the Bell decision in two recent cases: Skurstenis v. Jones,\n236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir.2000) and Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001). Both cases make clear that the\nFourth Amendment requires jail officials to have \"reasonable suspicion\" that an arrestee is concealing weapons\nor contraband before they can perform a strip search. If jail officials have reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is\nconcealing weapons or contraband, then they do not infringe on her constitutional rights by conducting a strip\nsearch.\nIn Skurstenis, the plaintiff was arrested for driving under the influence. While being booked into jail, she was strip\nsearched pursuant to a jail policy requiring that all arrestees be strip searched before being placed in a cell or\ndetention room. Skurstenis brought a § 1983 action, complaining that the strip search violated her rights under\nthe Fourth Amendment. This court held that Skurstenis's constitutional rights were not violated because there\nwas reasonable suspicion to search her based upon the fact that she had a handgun in the floorboard of her car\nwhen she was arrested. Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682. In dicta, the Skurstenis court addressed the jail's mandatory\nsearch policy by noting that \"[t]his policy, which does not require any reasonable suspicion, does not comport with\nthe requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\" Id.\nIn Wilson, we made the dicta of Skurstenis binding law. The plaintiff in Wilson was also arrested for driving under\nthe influence and strip searched pursuant to the same jail's policy. The court distinguished the case from \nSkurstenis by noting that \"unlike Skurstenis, there is no evidence that the officers at Shelby County Jail had\nreasonable suspicion that Wilson was concealing weapons or any other type of contraband.\" Wilson, 251 F.3d at\n1343. The Wilson court therefore held that the jail policy of searching all arrestees violated the Fourth\nAmendment. Id.\nIn this case, we hold that Cuesta's constitutional rights were not violated because TGK officers had reasonable\n[7]\nsuspicion to search based upon the violent and threatening language and imagery contained in the pamphlet.\n970 The record makes evident *970 that TGK personnel knew about the violent contents of the pamphlet. The arrest\naffidavit indicated to TGK officials that Cuesta had been charged with both \"Distributing Unlawful Hate\nPublication\" and \"Hate Crime Enhancement.\" The narrative on the arrest affidavit indicated that \"THE\nPAMPHLET CONTAINED `HATE CRIME' REMARKS DIRECTED TOWARD THE (BLACK) PRINCIPAL AND\nNON ENGLISH SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS. THE PAMPHLET REFERED [sic] TO `SHOOTING DAWSON IN THE\nHEAD' AND THE `AFRICAN DISEASE.'\" TGK officers also were made aware of the pamphlet's content by Officer\nGalardi, the Miami-Dade Police Officer who transported Cuesta to TGK. Galardi indicated in his deposition that\nhe spent \"[r]oughly an hour, forty-five minutes\" attending to Cuesta's booking. Cuesta similarly stated in her\ndeposition that Officer Galardi spoke with the booking agents about her for approximately twenty minutes before\nshe was taken to be strip searched.\nCuesta argues that the County failed to introduce evidence that anyone at TGK actually knew the contents of the\npamphlet at the time she was searched, and therefore summary judgment should not have been granted for the\nCounty. It is true that on a motion for summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be made in favor of the\nnon-moving party. Arrington, 139 F.3d at 871 (11th Cir.1998). \"A court need not permit a case to go to a jury,\nhowever, when the inferences that are drawn from the evidence, and upon which the non-movant relies, are\n\n`implausible.'\" Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting Matsushita Elec.\nIndus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 592, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). In this case, it is\nimplausible to believe that TGK personnel did not know about the violent and hateful language contained in the\n[8]\npamphlet, given the contents of the arrest affidavit and their lengthy discussion with Officer Galardi.\nCuesta's argument also fails because in a § 1983 action, the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on every\nelement. See, e.g., Miller v. Taylor, 877 F.2d 469, 472 (6th Cir.1989) (plaintiff in § 1983 excessive force action had\nburden of proving that force was excessive); Edwards v. Philadelphia, 860 F.2d 568, 572 (3d Cir.1988) (same); \nDavis v. Lane, 814 F.2d 397, 401 (7th Cir.1987) (prisoner alleging Eighth Amendment violation bore burden of\nproving every element, including that guard acted without justification). Because Cuesta alleges that she was\nsearched without reasonable suspicion, it is her burden to show that the County lacked reasonable suspicion to\nsearch her. Armington v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia, 767 F.Supp. 661, 667 (E.D.Pa.1991) (\"In a § 1983 action\nplaintiff has the burden of proving that defendant lacked reasonable suspicion.\"). Cuesta failed to produce any\nevidence indicating that the TGK personnel lacked reasonable suspicion that she was concealing weapons or\n971 contraband. *971 Therefore, Cuesta's claim that her constitutional rights were violated by the strip search fails as\na matter of law.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the district court's grants of summary judgment to both the County and the School\nBoard are AFFIRMED.\n[1] The essay included the following language: \nI have often wondered what would happen if I shot Dawson in the head and other teachers who have pissed me\noff or shot the fucking bastard who thought I looked at him wrong or the airheaded cheerleader who is more\nconcerned about what added layer of Revlon she's putting on instead of the fact that she's blocking my path or, I\nwould shoot (twice) the fucking freshmen who think they're cool cuz they're in high school.\n[2] The relevant portion of § 836.11 states: \nIt shall be unlawful to print, publish, distribute or cause to be printed, published or distributed by any means, or in\nany manner whatsoever, any publication, handbill, dodger, circular, booklet, pamphlet, leaflet, card, sticker,\nperiodical, literature, paper or other printed material which tends to expose any individual or any religious group\nto hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy unless [the name and address of those responsible for the publication] is\nclearly printed or written thereon.\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 836.11 (West 2001).\n[3] The relevant portion of § 775.085 states: \nThe penalty for any felony or misdemeanor shall be reclassified as provided in this subsection if the commission\nof such felony or misdemeanor evidences prejudice based on the race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, sexual\norientation, national origin, mental or physical disability, or advanced age of the victim:\n* * * *\n2. A misdemeanor of the first degree is reclassified to a felony of the third degree.\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 775.085 (West 2001).\n[4] Cuesta also claims that the School Board should be held liable for the police officer's arrest under a theory of \nrespondeat superior, but this argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in Monell v. Dep't of Social\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (\"We conclude, therefore, that a local\ngovernment may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.\").\n\n[5] It is unclear whether the School Board would be liable even if its policy was the \"moving force\" behind\nCuesta's arrest, because § 836.11 was valid law at the time of the arrest. The \"subsequently determined invalidity\nof [a statute] on vagueness grounds does not undermine the validity of the arrest made for violation of that\n[statute].\" Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 40, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979). The Supreme Court has\nstated that \"[t]he enactment of a law forecloses speculation by enforcement officers concerning its\nconstitutionality00with the possible exception of a law so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of\n97\nreasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws.\" Id. at 38, 99 S.Ct. 2627. Because we hold that the School\nBoard's policy was not the moving force behind the arrest, there is no need for us to address whether § 836.11\nwas \"grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional.\"\n[6] The County argues that the search should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Under the law of this circuit, however, a strip search performed without reasonable suspicion\nviolates the Fourth Amendment rights of the, individual searched. See Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343\n(11th Cir.2001). Because Cuesta's § 1983 action alleges that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated, this\nopinion will examine her rights under that constitutional amendment.\n[7] The County argues that reasonable suspicion was also provided, in part, by the fact that one of the other\nstudents involved in creating and distributing the pamphlet voluntarily turned over a small knife prior to being\ntransported. The County provides no support in the record for this claim, and we have been unable to locate this\nfact in an independent search of the record. We therefore will not consider it on review. See Welch v. Celotex\nCorp., 951 F.2d 1235, 1237 n. 3 (11th Cir.1992) (\"Upon review of a grant by a district court of a motion for\nsummary judgment, a federal appellate court may examine only the evidence which was before the district court\nwhen the latter decided the motion for summary judgment.\").\n[8] Because we hold that Cuesta suffered no deprivation of her constitutional rights, we need not decide the\nquestion of whether the County's policy, in which all felony arrestees are strip searched, might deprive others of\ntheir constitutional rights. See City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 811, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806\n(1986); Rooney v. Watson, 101 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (11th Cir.1996) (\"[O]ur finding that the Rooneys did not suffer\nany constitutional deprivation makes it unnecessary to consider Volusia County's policy or custom.\").\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
