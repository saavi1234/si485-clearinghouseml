Illinois, Eastern Division.\nJuly 3, 1996.\nJanis M. Susler, G. Flint Taylor, Jr., People's Law Offices, Chicago, IL, for Jane Doe.\n601 *601 Irene Schild Caminer, Sharon Baldwin, Margaret Ann Carey, Patricia Jo Kendall, City of Chicago, Law\nDepartment, Corporation Counsel, Chicago, IL, Susan S. Sher, Corporation Counsel, City of Chicago, Chicago,\nIL, for City of Chicago.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nBUCKLO, District Judge.\nOn January 18, 1996, Magistrate Judge Bobrick submitted to me a Report and Recommendation regarding the\nmotion of defendant Donald Norton for summary judgment on counts II, IV, and VI of plaintiff Jane Doe's\n[1]\ncomplaint.  Mr. Norton filed objections to the Report and Recommendation on February 1, 1996. Judge Bobrick\nrecommended that count VI be dismissed. Plaintiff did not oppose defendant's motion for summary judgment on\ncount VI and did not file an objection to Judge Bobrick's recommendation. Summary judgment is therefore\nentered in favor of defendant Norton on count VI of plaintiff's complaint. Judge Bobrick also recommended that\ndefendant's motion for summary judgment on counts II and IV be denied. For the reasons discussed below, I\nadopt the magistrate judge's recommendation as to count IV but decline to adopt his recommendation as to count\nII.\nThe following facts are undisputed. On October 20, 1994, Mr. Norton was assigned to serve a summons and\ncomplaint on Ms. Doe. Upon going to the police station in Elmhurst, Illinois, where he believed Ms. Doe lived, Mr.\nNorton learned that there was a valid warrant for her arrest. Mr. Norton proceeded to Ms. Doe's home in Chicago\nin order to complete service. Mr. Norton rang Ms. Doe's doorbell, but she did not respond. After seeing Ms. Doe\nat the window of her apartment, Mr. Norton stated his name and position and said that he had something to hand\nher. Ms. Doe refused to open the door, telling Mr. Norton to leave the package in the vestibule of her building. Mr.\nNorton then informed the Chicago Police Department of the outstanding warrant and Ms. Doe's location. Two\npolice officers, including defendant Contino, soon arrived to execute the arrest warrant. After the police arrived on\nthe scene, Mr. Norton did not speak to Ms. Doe. Eventually, one of the officers kicked in Ms. Doe's door. Mr.\nNorton and the officer then entered Ms. Doe's apartment. While in the apartment, Mr. Norton's activities consisted\nonly of looking into a couple of rooms. Once Mr. Norton saw that the officer had located and arrested Ms. Doe,\nMr. Norton left the apartment and waited in the hall. Mr. Norton and Ms. Doe did not travel to the police station\ntogether. Mr. Norton was not involved in or aware of any search of Ms. Doe at the police station or police\nheadquarters.\nUnder 18 U.S.C. ยง 3109, before police break into a home, they are required to knock, announce and be refused\nentry. United States v. Markling, 7 F.3d 1309, 1318 (7th Cir.1993). See also United States v. Maden, 64 F.3d\n1505, 1508 (10th Cir.1995); United States v. Turner, 926 F.2d 883, 886 (9th Cir.1991). In order for the police to be\nrefused entry, \"the announcement of authority `must be followed by a pause long enough for someone to answer\nor come to the door.'\" Markling, 7 F.3d at 1318 (citation omitted). Pauses as short as twenty seconds are\ngenerally deemed adequate. United States v. DeLutis, 722 F.2d 902, 909 (1st Cir.1983) (cited by Markling, 7 F.3d\nat 1318). Mr. Norton states that he and the police were outside Ms. Doe's door for ten minutes before breaking it\n\ndown, citing to his affidavit in support of this statement. Local Rule 12(M) Stmt. at ยถ 7. Ms. Doe admits that she\ndid not open the door. Local Rule 12(N) Stmt. at ยถ 7. She disagrees, however, that the police waited ten minutes\nbefore kicking in her door, citing only to her neighbor's affidavit which declares that the police were not outside\nthe door ten minutes before breaking into the apartment, though they did wait long enough for one officer to call\nout five times and pound his fists on the door. Local Rule 12(N) Stmt. at ยถ 7. This affidavit is not sufficient\n602 evidence to create a question of *602 fact as to whether Mr. Norton violated Ms. Doe's rights under the Fourth\nAmendment by breaking down her door.\nMs. Doe also has not set forth sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether Mr. Norton's\nsubsequent entry and search of her apartment violated her rights under the Fourth Amendment for the purpose of\ncount II. With an arrest warrant and probable cause to believe that the individual is home, an officer is entitled to\nenter the individual's home and search anywhere in it in which she might be found. Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S.\n325, 333, 334 n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1097, 1098 n. 1, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1989). Moreover,\nas an incident to the arrest the officers could, as a precautionary matter and without probable\ncause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place\nof arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.\nId. at 334, 100 S.Ct. at 1098. Mr. Norton had a warrant for Ms. Doe's arrest as well as probable cause to believe\nthat she was in her home. Thus, in entering Ms. Doe's apartment and checking a couple of rooms in the\napartment prior to her arrest, Mr. Norton did not violate Ms. Doe's rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.\nAccordingly, Mr. Norton's motion for summary judgment on count II of Ms. Doe's complaint is granted.\nIn count IV of her complaint, Ms. Doe attempts to hold Mr. Norton liable for Mr. Contino's conduct under a\nconspiracy theory. To prove a conspiracy, plaintiff must show \"a combination of two or more persons acting in\nconcert to commit an unlawful act, or to commit a lawful act by unlawful means, the principal element of which is\nagreement between the parties.\" Kunik v. Racine County, 946 F.2d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir.1991) (citation omitted).\nMs. Doe alleges that after entering her apartment, Mr. Contino kicked in the bathroom door, looked in rooms and\nher closet, and verbally abused and ridiculed her. Mr. Contino has not filed a motion for summary judgment. Mr.\nContino's alleged verbal abuse and ridicule did not violate Ms. Doe's rights under the Fourth Amendment. E.g., \nSlagel v. Shell Oil Refinery, 811 F.Supp. 378, 382 (C.D.Ill.1993). However, as noted in the decision on Mr.\nContino's motion to dismiss, no officer is entitled to use excessive force in making an arrest. Mr. Norton has not\naddressed Ms. Doe's allegations that Mr. Contino kicked in Ms. Doe's bathroom door, or the alleged necessity for\nthis action if it occurred. Accordingly, on the record before me, Mr. Norton is not entitled to summary judgment on\nCount IV.\nFinally, Mr. Norton contends that he is qualifiedly immune from being held liable, arguing that his conduct did not\nviolate \"clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Kernats v.\nO'Sullivan, supra, 35 F.3d 1171, 1176 (7th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). It is plain that Ms. Doe's right to be free\nfrom an unlawful search of her home is clearly established. Mr. Norton certainly would have been aware of this\nright. The record presently before me does not permit a determination as to whether Mr. Norton conspired to\nperform an illegal search. Therefore, I agree with Judge Bobrick that Mr. Norton's motion for summary judgement\non Count IV on the grounds that qualified immunity protects him from liability must be denied.\n[1] After the magistrate judge issued his Report and Recommendation, Ms. Doe filed an amended complaint that\nsubstitutes defendants Hunt and Hardin for defendants Hunt-Hardin and McCary.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
