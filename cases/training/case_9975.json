REMANDED IN PART. \n     \n   \n Footnotes \n \n*  Hon. James L. Foreman, of the Southern District of Illinois, is sitting by designation. \n \n \n1  This ruling disposed of claims for simple assault and battery against Flanigan and Winterroth (Counts I and XI) and false arrest and \nimprisonment against Flanigan (Count III). It has not been appealed. \n \n \n2  The Code provides, in pertinent part: \n(c) No person arrested for a traffic, regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in cases involving weapons or a controlled \n \nsubstance, shall be strip searched unless there is a reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon or controlled \nsubstance. \n(d) โStrip searchโ means having an arrested person remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a \nvisual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus, female breasts or undergarments of such person. \n. . . . . \n(f) Every peace officer or an employee of a police department conducting a strip search shall: \n(1) obtain the written permission of the police commander or an agent thereof designated for the purposes of authorizing a \nstrip search in accordance with this section. \n(2) Prepare a report of the strip search. The report shall include the written authorization required by paragraph (1) of this \nsubsection (f), the name of the person subjected to the search, the names of the persons conducting the search, and the time, \ndate and place of the search. A copy of the report shall be provided to the person subject to the search. \n. . . . . \n(h) Any police officer or employee who knowingly or intentionally fails to comply with any provision of this Section is guilty \nof official misconduct as provided in Section 103โ8 [725 ILCS 5/103โ8]; provided however, that nothing contained in this \nSection shall preclude prosecution of a peace officer or employee under another section of this Code. \n(i) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting any statutory or common law rights of any person for purposes of a \ncivil action or injunctive relief. \n725 Ill.Comp.Stat. 5/103โ1 (1993). \n \n3  Matthews provides that three factors must be balanced in order to determine what process is due in a particular situation: \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such \n11 \n \n\n \n   \n \n \n  interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional and substitute procedural safeguards; and \nfinally, the Governmentโs interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the \nadditional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. \n424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. \n \n4  Because we find that there was no constitutional violation, it is unnecessary to consider whether Davis was entitled to qualified \nimmunity. See Cornfield v. Consolidated High Sch. Dist. No. 230, 991 F.2d 1316, 1328 (7th Cir.1993) (Easterbrook, J., concurring) \n \n(โonce we conclude ... that the individual defendants respected [the plaintiffโs] constitutional rights[,]โ the case is over and it is \nunnecessary to determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity). \n \n5  Section 12โ3 defines battery as conduct of a person which โby any means (1) causes bodily harm to an individual or (2) makes \nphysical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with an individual.โ 720 Ill.Comp.Stat. 5/12โ3. \n \n \n6  Indeed, the magistrate judgeโs ruling was based entirely on the following cursory findings: \n1. I find that there was probable cause for Troopers Flanigan and Winterroth to arrest the plaintiff for driving under the \n \ninfluence of alcohol in violation of Illinois law. This is predicated upon credible evidence of plaintiffโs difficulty in \ncontrolling and stopping the pick-up truck he was driving. After stopping and while talking to Trooper Flanigan plaintiff \npermitted the truck to roll forward, prompting Flanigan to reach into the truck, to place the shift lever into the park position, \nand to turn the engine off and to remove the keys from the ignition switch. It is further predicated upon the testimony of \nTroopers Flanigan and Winterroth that the plaintiff had difficulty standing, difficulty understanding directions, upon his \nfailure of physical tests and odor of alcohol. He also admitted consuming some beer. \n2. I find that Trooper Flanigan had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff was attempting to conceal something in his \nclothing from the actions Trooper Flanigan observed. Whether the plaintiff was simply adjusting his clothing, tucking in his \nshirt, or whatever he was doing was easily misunderstood by the trooper. Because of his observations, Trooper Flanigan \nthought plaintiff was trying to hide something. It was those perceptions that he conveyed to Correctional Officer Davis and to \nDavisโ supervisor, Sergeant Lickiss. \n3. I find that Trooper Flanigan did not request a strip search of the plaintiff. He simply told and reiterated his belief that the \nplaintiff had something concealed in his trousers. His testimony that he hold Jailer Davis [to] โcheck him (the plaintiff) real \ngoodโ is credible, and that Flanigan was interested in assuring that no weapon or contraband be allowed to enter the jail. This \nwas all said before anyone knew whether Kraushaar would make bail or not. If not, he would have been detained at the jail. \n4. I find no credible evidence to support a claim that either Trooper Flanigan or Trooper Winterroth used unnecessary force or \nindeed any force at all in effecting the arrest of the plaintiff or in transporting him to the jail. \n \n7  Similarly, we are unable to find that the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. First, although the issue was raised generally \nin the final pre-trial order before the district court, Flanigan did not argue the point with respect to this strip search during the trial. \n \nHe also did not raise the issue on appeal. Thus, the argument has been waived. \nSecondly, there are several cases which suggest that qualified immunity would not exist for a strip search conducted in public \nview. See Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1014 (4th Cir.1981) (โWe think, as a matter of law, no police officer in this day and \ntime could reasonably believe that conducting a strip search in an area exposed to the general view of persons known to be in \nthe vicinityโwhether or not any actually viewed the searchโis a constitutionally valid governmental โinvasion of [the] personal \nrights that [such a] search entails.โ โ), cert. denied sub nom. Clements v. Logan, 455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 \n(1982); Iskander v. Village of Forest Park, 690 F.2d 126, 129 (7th Cir.1982) (โDefendant naturally does not maintain that \nroutine strip searches may be  conducted in a room open to the prying eyes of passing strangers consistent with the \nreasonableness  requirement  imposed  on  all  searches  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  nor  would  such  a  contention  be \nentertained.โ) (citing Logan, 660 F.2d at 1014). \n \n8  The fact that this claim was unresolved does not affect the decision regarding the reasonableness of the search at the jail. Even if \nFlanigan had searched Kraushaar at the scene, that would not necessarily rule out the need for a more thorough search of \n \nKraushaarโs underwear at the jail if the search at the scene failed to produce the suspected contraband. \n \n9  Moreover, even if Kraushaar sustained the bruises during the arrest, the officersโ testimony shows that they had considerable \ndifficulty in getting Kraushaar to comply with their requests to get spread-eagle. Thus, the officers would have had to apply some \n \nforce, and perhaps cause some bruising, in order to overcome the arresteeโs resistance. Under those circumstances, the force used \nby the officers would not be unreasonable or excessive. \n \n \n  \n12 \n ",
