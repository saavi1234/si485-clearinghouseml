Kral, J.) ordered supression. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's decision. People v. Seymour, 398 N.E.2d 1191 (Ill. App. 1979), but on February 3, 1981, the Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the lower courts' decisions, holding that the specific details of any strip search determine its reasonableness. Pepole v. Seymour, 416 N.E. 2d 1070 (Ill. 1981).</p><p>The court held that the failure of the officers to inform the defendant that his was a bailable offense, (thus creating a custodial situation, as defendant had funds on his person sufficient to post bond) did not make the subsequent search unreasonable. Further, the court held that the search was reasonable because it was conducted incident to lawful arrest and was not so intrusive as to make it unreasonable.   </p><p>398 N.E.2d 1191</p><p></p>",

App.3d 221 (1979)\n398 N.E.2d 1191\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nWILLIAM SEYMOUR, Defendant-Appellee.\nNo. 78-2033.\nIllinois Appellate Court 00 First District (3rd Division).\n97\nOpinion filed December 31, 1979.\n222223 *222*223 Bernard Carey, State's Attorney, of Chicago (Marcia B. Orr, Paul C. Gridelli, and Christopher Cronson,\nAssistant State's Attorneys, of counsel), for the People.\nSam Adam, Marvin Bloom, and Arnette Hubbard, all of Chicago, for appellee.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. PRESIDING JUSTICE SIMON delivered the opinion of the court:\nA strip search is humiliating, degrading and embarrassing. Nevertheless, at times efficient police procedures\nrequire that arrestees undergo that kind of search to protect the safety of police officers, to maintain order in jails\nand to disclose the fruits of a crime. These legitimate public needs do not justify a strip search under the\ncircumstances with which we deal in this case 00 an arrest made for a minor offense, one the legislature has\n97\nlabeled a misdemeanor, where the arrestee is able to satisfy the amount of bail which has been preset by judicial\nrule and where there is no need to incarcerate the arrestee or even detain him at the station house for more than\na brief period needed by the police to determine whether he is subject to a more serious charge.\nWilliam Seymour was arrested for a minor offense, then taken to the police station and strip searched. He\nadvances several grounds for upholding the circuit court's order suppressing the minute amount of cocaine found\nin the course of that search. First, the cocaine was found only because police breached their duty to inform\nSeymour of his right to post bail and gain his immediate release. Second, because of the nature of the accusation\nagainst Seymour, the strip search was an unreasonable invasion of his privacy in violation of article I, section 6 of\nthe Illinois Constitution of 1970. Third, the strip search, made without a warrant, did not fall into any of the\n224 exceptions to the warrant requirement and was *224 under the circumstances unreasonable and a violation of his\nfourth and fourteenth amendment rights.\nBefore discussing these rationales, it is useful to draw distinctions between the various types of searches of an\nindividual's person. Taken in the order by which they intrude into an individual's privacy, they are: First, the \"pat\ndown,\" in which police frisk a suspect's outer clothing in order to find concealed weapons; second, the \"pocket\nsearch,\" in which police rummage through a suspect's pockets, usually to find weapons but also to find the fruits\nof a crime or contraband; third, the \"clothing search,\" in which police closely examine a suspect's clothes; fourth,\nthe \"strip search,\" in which a suspect is forced to strip naked under the glaring eye of a police examination; fifth,\nthe \"body cavity search,\" in which police strip the suspect naked and examine all openings of the body where\ncontraband or weapons could be secreted; sixth, the \"body intrusion,\" in which the examination goes beyond the\nouter limits of a suspect's body and the police pump the stomach or remove the blood without consent.\n00 1 Both the Illinois and the United States Constitutions require that police obtain judicial warrant for their actions\n95\nbefore engaging even in reasonable searches that invade an individual's privacy. The explanation for that\nprohibition was stated long ago by Mr. Justice Jackson in his dissent in Brinegar v. United States (1949), 338\nU.S. 160, 180-81, 93 L.Ed. 1879, 1893, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1313:\n\"Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the\nindividual and putting terror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and\n\nmost effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government. And one need only briefly to\nhave dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but deprived of\nthese rights to know that the human personality deteriorates and dignity and self-reliance\ndisappear where homes, persons and possessions are subject at any hour to unheralded search\nand seizure by the police.\"\n00 2 The need for swift action in certain limited situations has led to the formulation of several exceptions to the\n95\nwarrant requirement. When police action fits into an exception and is reasonable, the constitutions do not forbid\nthe use of evidence uncovered in a warrantless search. The State seeks to fit the search of Seymour into these\nexceptions.\nI\nSeymour was charged by complaint with possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of section\n225 402 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 56 1/2, par. 1402). A preliminary *225\nhearing resulted in a finding of probable cause. The defendant moved to suppress the cocaine seized in the\nsearch, and a hearing on his motion disclosed the following evidence.\nThe parties first stipulated to the testimony of Chicago police sergeant Peter Nielson, given at the preliminary\nhearing. Nielson had testified that he and Officer Michael Cronin were patrolling North Clark Street in Chicago on\nJuly 27, 1977, in a marked squad car when, at about 9 p.m., they saw the defendant leaning through the\npassenger's window of a car. When the officers pulled their car up behind the parked vehicle, Seymour stood up\nand began to walk away from them. Nielson got out of the squad, noticed that the parked car had keys in its\nignition, and ordered the defendant to stop. Seymour's shirt was hanging outside of his pants as the police\napproached him. When Sergeant Nielson asked Seymour for some identification, the defendant began to reach\ninto his pants pocket. Before he could, Nielson patted Seymour down.\nNielson found a loaded .38 revolver in Seymour's waistband. The officers immediately placed Seymour under\narrest and called for a transport to the 18th District police station. While waiting in Nielson's squad for the\ntransport to arrive, Seymour explained to the officers that the parked car was his and that he had a gun\nregistration card for the revolver. Cronin added that, while waiting, Seymour told Nielson that he had been in the\npenitentiary before and so asked the sergeant to give him a break. Nielson did not mention such a remark in his\ntestimony, and Seymour denied making it.\nSeymour testified that when he was stopped, it was Cronin, not Nielson, who initially patted him down and\ndiscovered the concealed weapon. Nielson had testified that Cronin was off duty and out of uniform at the time of\nthe arrest. When a second squad car arrived at the scene to take Seymour to the station, he was again searched.\nThis time, officers both patted him down and performed a pocket search.\nWhen Seymour was arrested, he was carrying both a valid State firearms identification card and $390 in cash.\nAfter arriving at the 18th District station he was searched for a third time. This time, police patted him down,\nsearched his pockets and frisked him under his shirt. Seymour was then taken into the station house lockup to be\nfingerprinted. When his prints had been taken, he was told to wash his hands and was directed to a small\nwashroom just off the lockup.\nWhile Seymour was washing his hands, Officer Cronin entered the washroom. According to Seymour, Cronin\nsaid that Seymour was not a good guy, and Cronin patted him down for the fourth time. When Seymour finished\ndrying his hands, Cronin ordered him to take off his clothes. Seymour testified he was stripped naked and a full\n226 body cavity search followed. Cronin's testimony was that he first told Seymour to *226 remove his shoes,\nsearched them, then ordered Seymour to strip naked. He denied that there was a body cavity search.\nWhile searching through Seymour's clothing, Cronin found a tinfoil packet, either in Seymour's shoe or sock.\nCronin had seen similar packets before, usually containing heroin or cocaine, and usually concealed in places on\na suspect's person which required a search more intrusive than a pocket search. At some later point, Cronin\nopened the packet, and found that it contained .22 grams, or about 1/100 of an ounce, of cocaine.\n\nCronin claimed at the hearing on the motion to suppress that the police department had issued a general order\nrequiring that all persons arrested be put into the lockup so that they could be fingerprinted, but when challenged\nby defense counsel he could not specify which general order it was. He also testified that at the 18th District\nstation certain arrestees 00 those picked up for drunk and disorderly or disorderly conduct, as well as traffic\n97\noffenders 00 are not fingerprinted at all and are not taken into the lockup. Instead, they are put in a small room\n97\nlocated behind the booking sergeant's desk, so that the arresting officer can talk to them while filling out the\narrest report and preparing charges.\nCronin testified that to find out an arrestee's record, police procedure is to fingerprint the arrestee and wait 2 to 3\nhours until the criminal history sheet comes back from the Bureau of Identification. Cronin described an alternate\nidentification procedure which is also used in which the arrestee's name is checked against the Chicago Police\nDepartment's \"alpha file.\" This method is quicker but less complete than checking fingerprints. Cronin did not\nknow if there was a police department order requiring that all persons taken into the lockup be strip searched. He\nsaid that the decision to strip search any given arrestee was his, to be exercised at his own \"personal, individual\ndiscretion.\"\nCronin acknowledged that he would know the amount of Seymour's bail if the offense for which he had been\narrested was a misdemeanor. Seymour testified he was never told of his right to post bail. He testified that he told\nthe arresting officers about the money he was carrying, but Cronin stated that Seymour never exactly said how\nmuch money he had.\nThe circuit court refused to suppress the .38 revolver. However, it ruled that while police could validly detain the\ndefendant for a reasonable time after his arrest, to prepare charges and check identification, 2 to 3 hours was\nunreasonably long. The court found that Seymour was only charged with the misdemeanor offense of unlawful\nuse of weapons, and that since this was a bondable offense with bail set by rule of the supreme court, the\ndefendant should have been told of his right to post bail and be released immediately. If he had, Seymour would\nnever have had to enter the lockup, and so would never have been strip searched.\n227 The State's position on appeal can be briefly stated. It is that Officer *227 Cronin reasonably thought that\nSeymour had been in the penitentiary within 5 years of his arrest, and therefore carrying a concealed weapon\nwould be a felony instead of a misdemeanor. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 24-1(a)(4), (b).) If a felony,\nSeymour's offense was not covered by the supreme court rules on bail in misdemeanor offenses and he would\nhave to be locked up to await a court appearance for bail to be set. The State argues that the strip search was\ntherefore lawful and reasonable, either as a search incident to a full custodial arrest or as an inventory search\nprior to incarceration.\nII\n00 3 The standard of review of a suppression order is whether the trial court's ruling was manifestly erroneous. (\n95\nPeople v. Van Note (1978), 63 Ill. App.3d 53, 379 N.E.2d 834.) The circuit court's ruling here that Seymour was\narrested on a bondable misdemeanor offense was not erroneous. The trial judge stated that he was not\nconvinced by Cronin's testimony that Cronin thought at the time of the arrest that Seymour was a convicted felon.\nThis was understandable, especially since the State chose not to present the testimony of Nielson, to whom\nSeymour's penitentiary remark was directed, but rather introduced the evidence through the testimony of a mere\nbystander.\n00 4 In addition, it is undisputed that Seymour was carrying an apparently valid State firearms identification card.\n95\nThe police had no reason to believe it was invalid. Even assuming that Seymour told police that he had served\nsome time in prison, the fact that he had what appeared to be a valid firearms identification card indicated he had\nnot been in prison during the 5 years before his arrest. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 83-4(a)(2)(ii).) Thus, the\ntrial court did not err in holding that Seymour did not have to submit to a 3-hour identification process to\ndetermine what offense he could be charged with.\n\nSince the defendant was arrested on a charge of unlawful use of weapons, a misdemeanor, the amount of his\nbail was governed by the supreme court rules on bail in misdemeanor offenses. Bail is a constitutional right (U.S.\nConst., amend. VIII; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, § 9) and the legislature has authorized the supreme court to prescribe\na uniform schedule of bail amounts for misdemeanors. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 110-15.\n00 5 Supreme Court Rule 528(c) sets the amount of bail for misdemeanor unlawful use of weapons (Ill. Rev. Stat.\n95\n1977, ch. 110A, par. 528(c)), and under that Rule and Rule 530 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110A, par. 530),\nSeymour was entitled to immediate release upon depositing $100 with either the clerk of the circuit court or with\nany police officer. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, pars. 110-7(a), 110-7(b), 110-9.\n228 *228 The misdemeanor bail scheme established by statute and rule provides for quick release from custody. As\nthe supreme court noted:\n\"Bail is present to avoid undue delay in freeing certain persons accused of an offense when,\nbecause of the hour or the circumstances, it is not practicable to bring the accused before a judge.\nWhen the accused is actually brought before a judge, the bail amounts specified in these rules do\nnot control. Nothing in these rules is intended to limit a peace officer's discretion to issue a Notice\nto Appear in an appropriate case * * *.\" Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110A, art. V, part B.\nIf the police were not pleased with Seymour's release on $100 bond, they could issue a citation and require his\nappearance before a judge the next morning to set a higher bail. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 107-12.) Failure\nto appear would be grounds for his rearrest. But police could not, once Seymour told them he had ample money\nto post bond, unreasonably continue to keep him in custody.\nIII\n00 6 The circuit court did not err in holding that police officers are required to inform misdemeanor arrestees of\n95\ntheir right to post bail and be released. Long before Seymour's arrest, the legislature had shown its desire that\narrestees be informed of their rights, among them the right to bail, by enacting section 103-7 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 103-7). This provision requires that the statutes\ngoverning, inter alia, the right to post bail be displayed where persons awaiting bail can read them. Illinois court\ndecisions and statutes now require that police additionally inform arrestees of their right to remain silent (People\nv. Smith (1969), 108 Ill. App.2d 172, 246 N.E.2d 689), their right to counsel (People v. Pagan (1972), 52 Ill.2d\n525, 288 N.E.2d 102), of the arresting officers' authority (People v. Sprovieri (1969), 43 Ill.2d 223, 252 N.E.2d 531\n), and of the precise offense on which the arrest is based (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 103-1(b)). Adding to\nthis a duty to inform misdemeanor arrestees of their right to post bail in a preset amount does not put an onerous\nburden on police, especially because this can be the responsibility of one desk officer at the station. Furthermore,\nunder the bail statute police already play an active role in accepting bail.\nBy interpreting the statute and rule as requiring the police to inform Seymour of his right to post a preset bail the\ncircuit court followed the lead of courts in other States with similar preset bail amounts for minor offenses. (See \nPeople v. Dixon (1974), 392 Mich. 691, 222 N.W.2d 749; People v. Currie (1975), 59 Mich. App. 659, 229 N.W.2d\n229 818; People v. Glass (1977), 73 Mich. App. 156, 250 N.W.2d 812; People v. Overlee*229 (1971), 174 Colo. 202,\n483 P.2d 222; People v. Superior Court (1972), 7 Cal.3d 186, 496 P.2d 1205, 101 Cal. Rptr. 837; People v.\nLongwill (1975), 14 Cal.3d 943, 538 P.2d 753, 123 Cal. Rptr. 297; United States v. Mills (D.C. Cir.1972), 472 F.2d\n1231.) It is important to note that the circuit court did not rule that police had to give the defendant a reasonable\nopportunity to raise the bail before taking him into the lockup. Other States have taken that step (cf. State v. Jetty\n(Mont. 1978), 579 P.2d 1228; State v. Gwinn (1973), 12 Or. App. 444, 506 P.2d 187; Zehrung v. State (Alas.\n1977), 569 P.2d 189), but it is not necessary to do so here, since Seymour had the money necessary to pay his\n$100 bond in his possession and the police were so informed.\n00 7 The circuit court ruled that even after learning that Seymour could post bond, police could detain him a\n95\nreasonable time to complete their investigation and fill out their arrest reports. That ruling was also correct. As\nnoted earlier, police could not be sure what offense Seymour had committed until they could determine if he had\n\nbeen in the penitentiary in the past 5 years. But, during this reasonable detention, police could not incarcerate the\ndefendant. He, like other misdemeanants, should have been kept in the small room behind the booking\nsergeant's desk. There he would be available for questioning which would facilitate the preparation of the\ncharges, and there, after four pat-down searches and several pocket and clothes searches, he would pose no\nthreat to the police.\n00 8, 9 Seymour should not have been taken into the lockup simply to be fingerprinted. A proper concern for the\n95\nreasonable expectations of privacy of misdemeanor arrestees soon to be released on bail required the police to\nlocate their fingerprint and other identification equipment outside the region of maximum confinement. It was\nunnecessary to put the apparatus behind steel bars. As was said in State v. Jetty (Mont. 1978), 579 P.2d 1228,\n1230:\n\"The only excuse given was that [placing the arrestee in a holding cell] was standard procedure at\nthe jail. It was explained that * * * there was no jailer and the arresting officer had to get back on\npatrol. Lack of manpower and standard procedure cannot eliminate the individual's constitutional\nright to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.\"\n00 10, 11 Implicit in the statutes and rules setting forth the bail amounts for minor offenses is the arrestee's right to\n95\nimmediately post bail and avoid the indignity of being placed in full custodial incarceration in the station house\nlockup. To protect that right, police must, when they book the arrestee for violating a minor offense, explain the\namount of bail the arrestee must post to be released. Police in this case did not do so. The fruits of their breach\nof duty were therefore properly suppressed. We can see no other practical method by which the courts can\n230 insure that *230 police will fulfill their duty and so protect a misdemeanant's right to speedy release on bail. (See \nSilverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States (1920), 251 U.S. 385, 64 L.Ed. 319, 40 S.Ct. 182; Wong Sun v. United\nStates (1963), 371 U.S. 471, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, 83 S.Ct. 407.) The circuit court was correct in suppressing the\ncocaine.\nIV\nThe suppression order was correct for a second, alternative reason: the strip search was an unconstitutional\nviolation of Seymour's privacy. Article I, section 6 of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 provides:\n\"The people shall have the right to be secure in their persons * * * against unreasonable searches,\nseizures, invasions of privacy or interceptions of communications by eavesdropping devices or\nother means.\"\nSection 6 protects against highly intrusive invasions, although its further scope has not yet been defined (see \nIllinois State Employees Association v. Walker (1974), 57 Ill.2d 512, 315 N.E.2d 9; Oden v. Cahill (1979), 79 Ill.\nApp.3d 768, 398 N.E.2d 1061).\n00 12-14 The right to privacy protects only against unreasonable intrusions. (Illinois NORML, Inc. v. Scott (1978),\n95\n66 Ill. App.3d 633, 638, 383 N.E.2d 1330, 1334.) Lawful incarceration deprives prisoners of many of the rights\nand privileges of other citizens, and warrantless searches of jail cells and prisoners under certain conditions do\nnot violate article I, section 6. (People v. Elkins (1978), 60 Ill. App.3d 883, 377 N.E.2d 569.) But the strip search of\nan individual arrested for a misdemeanor offense who has the funds in his possession to immediately post bond\nand be released is not reasonable. A strip search can be justified when \"* * * the modesty of one lawfully arrested\nmust give way to reasonable precautionary procedures designed to detect hidden evidence, drugs or objects\nwhich might be used against others or to cause self-inflicted harm.\" (United States v. Klein (1st Cir.1975), 522\nF.2d 296, 300-01.) However, when the defendant is charged only with a misdemeanor and may gain his release\nimmediately, his modesty and privacy must remain inviolate. The offense for which Seymour was arrested had no\nfruits which might have been hidden upon him. Because there was no justification for taking him into the lockup,\nthere was no need to discover contraband which could disrupt the order of that secured area. And, Seymour\nhaving already been patted down four times, his pockets having been searched twice and his clothes once, there\nwas no reasonable need for a strip search to protect the police officers from any hidden weapons while he was\nbeing detained. Because it was improper to incarcerate Seymour, no inventory search was necessary here.\n231\n\n*231 00 15 There was no justification for this search. Consequently, it was unreasonable and a violation of the\n95\ndefendant's right to privacy under the Illinois Constitution; the cocaine was properly suppressed.\n00 16 It should be noted that Seymour insisted that he had been the subject of a body cavity search in the\n95\nwashroom of a station house lockup by an off-duty and out-of-uniform officer. Such a search was hardly\nprofessional. For a body cavity search to be reasonable, there must be safeguards which strictly limit the\nintrusion and protect the arrestee's health and privacy. (See United States ex rel. Guy v. McCauley (E.D. Wisc.\n1974), 385 F. Supp. 193 (body cavity search should be performed by medical personnel); accord, United States\nex rel. Wolfish v. Levi (S.D.N.Y. 1977), 439 F. Supp. 114; United States v. Lilly (5th Cir.1978), 576 F.2d 1240\n(decision to make a body cavity search should not be arbitrary and subject should be given notice of the\nimpending intrusion).) A body cavity search of the kind described by the defendant would be unreasonable and a\nviolation of section 6. However, the body cavity search, although clearly not justified in this case if it did take\nplace, has no relevance to our decision because the cocaine was found during the strip search.\nOne charged with a minor offense who is brought to the station house to determine whether he is eligible to post\na preset bond should not be made the prey of a fishing expedition for evidence of other guilt.\n00 17 In affirming the suppression order we hold little sympathy for Seymour who, after all, was found to be\n95\ncarrying a controlled substance. But we reach this conclusion to protect others who, when being processed\nthrough the station house for minor offenses which do not require appearance before a judicial officer to be\nbailable, may be subjected to the humiliation, degradation and embarrassment of strip or body cavity searches.\nPublicity after the fact may illuminate their plight but will not prevent it; the circuit court was correct in using its\npower to suppress evidence to deter strip searches in the future in cases like this which involve an unreasonable\ninvasion of privacy.\nIn view of these conclusions, it is not necessary to discuss Seymour's reliance on the fourth amendment.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMcNAMARA and McGILLICUDDY, JJ., concur.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Fahner and William J. Scott, Attorneys General, of Springfield, and Bernard Carey,\nState's Attorney, of Chicago (Donald Mackay, Melbourne A. Noel, Jr., Assistant Attorneys General, of Chicago,\nand Marcia B. Orr and Mary Ellen Dienes, Assistant State's Attorneys, of Chicago, of counsel), for the People.\nSam Adam, of Chicago, for appellee.\nReversed.\nMR. JUSTICE RYAN delivered the opinion of the court:\nThe defendant, William Seymour, was found in possession of cocaine and charged with possession of a\ncontrolled substance. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the cocaine, which he alleged was\ntaken from him following a strip search. The Cook County circuit court allowed the motion and suppressed the\nevidence. The appellate court affirmed. (80 Ill. App.3d 221.) We granted the State leave to appeal under our Rule\n315. 73 Ill.2d R. 315.\nOn July 27, 1977, at about 9 p.m., Sergeant Neilson and Officer Cronin were patroling the vicinity of 450 North\nClark Street in Chicago in a marked squad car. The defendant was observed leaning into the passenger side of a\nparked automobile. When the officers pulled their car up behind the parked vehicle, the defendant stood up and\nbegan to walk away from them. Neilson got out of the squad car, noticed that the parked car had keys in its\nignition, and ordered the defendant to stop. Seymour's shirt was hanging outside of his pants as the police\napproached him. When Sergeant Neilson asked Seymour for some identification, the defendant began to reach\ninto his pants pocket. Before he could, Neilson patted him down. Neilson found a loaded .38-caliber revolver in\n29 Seymour's *29 waistband. The officers immediately placed Seymour under arrest and called for a vehicle to\ntransport defendant to the 18th district police station. While waiting in Sergeant Neilson's squad car, Seymour\nstated that the parked car was his and that he had a gun registration card for the revolver. Officer Cronin testified\nthat, while waiting, Seymour also mentioned that he had been in the penitentiary before and had a narcotics case\npending, and he couldn't take the heat. He asked Sergeant Neilson to give him a break. Seymour later denied\nmaking such a comment. When a second squad car arrived at the scene to take Seymour to the station, he was\nagain superficially searched. After arriving at the station, Seymour was again given a pat-down search.\nOnce at the police station, the defendant was fingerprinted. The fingerprint apparatus was located in the lockup\narea. After being fingerprinted, the defendant went to a sink in the lockup area to wash his hands. The two\narresting officers did not accompany the defendant to the police station but arrived after he had been\nfingerprinted. Officer Cronin approached the defendant as he finished washing his hands and directed the\ndefendant to remove his clothing. Officer Cronin testified that after the defendant removed his shoes the officer\nfound a tinfoil packet in one of the shoes. The defendant testified that he was required to strip naked and the\nofficer inspected him visually, after which the officer found the tinfoil packet in one of the defendant's socks. The\npacket contained .22 grams of cocaine. The defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance.\nIll. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 56 1/2, par. 1402.\nAt the hearing on the motion to suppress, the court made a finding that the initial arrest on the street was valid.\nThe defendant's motion to suppress the gun, therefore, was denied. The court stated its belief that the police\n\n30 would then be allowed a reasonable length of time *30 to detain the defendant so as to check his identity and\nprepare charges against him. However, the court found that, once at the police station, the defendant should\nhave been advised that he was charged with a misdemeanor which was bailable. It should then have been\ndetermined whether the defendant could make bail and, if not, only then could he be incarcerated. The court held\nthat, if a determination were made that the defendant could not post bail, he then could be searched before being\nplaced in the lockup. Because the defendant was not notified that he was being charged with a bailable offense\nand of his right to post bail, and since he had enough money with him to post the preset bail, he should not have\nbeen placed in the lockup and, consequently, should not have been searched. The discovered cocaine was\ntherefore suppressed, and the finding of probable cause was vacated.\nThe appellate court, in affirming the judgment of the circuit court, held that the police are required to advise all\narrestees charged with a misdemeanor of their right to post bail immediately. The appellate court further held\nthat, although the defendant could be detained a reasonable time for further investigation, he could not be placed\nin the police lockup and strip-searched during that time.\nWe will first address the question of whether it was necessary for the officers to inform the defendant of his right\nto post bail. The appellate court found such a requirement not as being constitutionally mandated, but as being\nrequired by that court's construction of the provisions of our Rule 528(c) (73 Ill.2d R. 528(c)), which presets the\namount of bail for the class of misdemeanors that includes the offense involved in this case, and from the\nprovisions of section 103-7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 103-7),\nwhich requires that posters informing the defendant of certain rights be posted in certain conspicuous places. We\n31 need not discuss the cases from Michigan, *31 Colorado and California relied on by the appellate court, because\nit is clear that our legislature, in enacting section 103-7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, did not intend\nto require that a defendant be orally informed of his right to post bail. The committee comments to this section, as\noriginally adopted in 1963, state:\n\"Defense representatives strongly urged a requirement in the Code that the arresting officer inform\nan arrestee of his rights. Others strongly opposed such a requirement. The Committee was not\npersuaded that the officer was the proper medium for conveying such information fully and\nunderstandably. This section was proposed as a compromise. It was accepted.\" (Ill. Ann. Stat., ch.\n38, par. 103-7, Committee Comments, at 84 (Smith-Hurd 1970).)\nThe General Assembly apparently felt that informing the accused of his rights through printed information\ncontained on posters located as required by statute was adequate and more likely to accurately inform an\naccused. It should be noted that, in situations where the General Assembly intended that the defendant be\npersonally informed of certain rights by specified individuals, it clearly stated so in the Code. (See Ill. Rev. Stat.\n1979, ch. 38, par. 103-1(a) (shall inform the person arrested that a warrant has been issued for his arrest and the\nnature of the offense); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 103-1(b) (after an arrest without a warrant 00 shall inform\n97\nthe person arrested of the nature of the offense upon which the arrest is based); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par.\n109-1(b)(1) (after arrest the judge shall inform the defendant of the charge against him); and Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979,\nch. 38, par. 109-1(b)(2) (must advise the defendant of his right to counsel).) We conclude that the legislature did\nnot intend to require that a defendant be orally advised by the police of his right to post bail.\nIt is also contended, and the trial court and the appellate court held, that since the defendant was lawfully\n32 arrested on an unlawful-use-of-weapons charge (Ill. Rev. *32 Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 24-1(a)(10)), which is a\nClass A misdemeanor (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 24-1(b)), and for which preset bail was fixed at $1,000 with\nthe 10% deposit statute applicable (73 Ill.2d R. 530), he should have been admitted to bail without having been\nplaced in the lockup area of the police station. Noting that the defendant had over $300 in cash on him when\narrested, the court found there was no question as to his ability to post the amount of preset bail. It is urged that,\nsince the defendant had the right to and could post bail, the police had no right to detain him and no need or right\nto conduct a search. Since the search was unauthorized, it is argued, the seizure of the tinfoil packet containing\nthe controlled substance was illegal and the evidence was properly suppressed.\nAlthough the unlawful use of weapons is only a Class A misdemeanor for which preset bail is provided by our\nRule 528(c), the offense becomes a Class 3 felony if committed within five years after the accused's release from\nprison or within five years after conviction if no prison sentence was imposed for a prior felony conviction. (Ill.\n\nRev. Stat. 1977, ch. 38, par. 24-1(b).) The officer stated that, following the arrest, the defendant asked for a break\nbecause he had a previous felony conviction. Acceptable police procedures would require that the officers\nascertain whether or not that conviction was within the period of time that would make the weapons charge a\nClass 3 felony. In fact, because of the possibility that this arrest involved a felony and not just a misdemeanor, a\nfurther routine identification check would be in order, even in the absence of such a remark by the suspect. In\nmaking this determination, it was necessary that the defendant be fingerprinted and that the fingerprints be\nprocessed through identification procedures. It was testified that this would require two to three hours. The trial\n33 court, in passing on the motion to suppress, stated its disbelief that *33 detention for this period of time would be\nnecessary. However, there is no evidence in the record that indicates a lesser period of time was required for the\nproper identification. It must be assumed that it was therefore necessary that the defendant be detained for\nwhatever time was required and that he could not be permitted to immediately post bail for a misdemeanor and\nbe released.\nSince the police were authorized to detain the defendant, the question then becomes what should be the nature\nof the detention, whether a search of the defendant was justified, and, if so, to what extent he could be searched.\nWe will postpone for the present the question of defendant's detention and consider the questions relating to\nsearch. The officers here effected a lawful arrest on the weapons charge and properly had the defendant\ntransported to the police station. Section 108-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977,\nch. 38, par. 108-1) provides that, when a lawful arrest is made by an officer, the officer may reasonably search\nthe person arrested for the purpose of (a) protecting the officer from attack, (b) preventing the person from\nescaping, (c) discovering the fruits of the crime, or (d) discovering any instruments, articles or things that had\nbeen used in the commission of, or which may constitute evidence of, any offense. The right to search a person\nincident to a lawful arrest for these purposes does not, however, depend solely upon the provisions of our statute.\nSuch a right has long been recognized both in England and in this country. (Weeks v. United States (1914), 232\nU.S. 383, 392, 58 L.Ed. 652, 655, 34 S.Ct. 341, 342; United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), 339 U.S. 56, 60, 94\nL.Ed. 653, 657, 70 S.Ct. 430, 432-33.) The fact that the search is conducted at the police station rather than at\nthe place of arrest does not by itself render the search invalid. United States v. Edwards (1974), 415 U.S. 800,\n34 803, 39 L.Ed.2d 771, 775, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1237; People v. Campbell (1977), *34 67 Ill.2d 308, 319.\nIn United States v. Robinson (1973), 414 U.S. 218, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 94 S.Ct. 467, the court considered the\nhistorical development of the right to search without a warrant incident to a lawful arrest. The court held that,\nwhile the justification to search a person incident to a lawful custodial arrest is based on the need to disarm and\ndiscover evidence, it does not depend upon what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular\nsituation that weapons or evidence would, in fact, be found on the suspect. The court stated:\n\"A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable instrusion under the\nFourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no\nadditional justification. * * * [I]n the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is\nnot only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but it is also a\n`reasonable' search under that Amendment. (Emphasis added.) (United States v. Robinson\n(1973), 414 U.S. 218, 235, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 440-41, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477.)\nIn United States v. Chadwick (1977), 433 U.S. 1, 53 L.Ed.2d 538, 97 S.Ct. 2476, the court held that the search of\na suspect's person incident to a lawful arrest may be conducted without a warrant, whether or not there is\nprobable cause to believe that the suspect may have a weapon or is about to destroy the evidence. The potential\ndanger lurking in all custodial arrests makes such searches reasonable. In our case we must conclude that the\nofficers, having effected a lawful arrest of the defendant, could conduct a search of his person while he was\ndetained at the police station. The Supreme Court, since Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88\n35 S.Ct. 1868, has quite consistently stated the authority to *35 search the person incident to arrest in terms which\nsuggest that there is no limitation based on probable cause to believe that weapons or evidence of a crime will be\nfound, and that the intensity of the search is not limited to the extent necessary to find items reasonably believed\nto be on the arrestee's person. See 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure sec. 5.2, at 266 (1978).\nThe fourth amendment of the Federal Constitution and article I, secton 6, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970\nprohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. There is no uniform rule for determining the reasonableness of a\n\nsearch. The determination of that question must depend upon the facts of a given case. (United States v.\nRabinowitz (1950), 339 U.S. 56, 94 L.Ed. 653, 70 S.Ct. 430; People v. Palmer (1976), 62 Ill.2d 261; People v.\nWatkins (1960), 19 Ill.2d 11.) In Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 18-19, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 903-04, 88 S.Ct. 1868,\n1878, the court noted that a search which is reasonable in its inception may violate the fourth amendment by\nvirtue of its intolerable intensity and scope. In Terry, the court also noted that although a search incident to an\narrest is justified in part by the necessity to protect an officer from assault with a concealed weapon, it is also\njustified on other grounds and can therefore involve a relatively intensive exploration of a person. Although Terry\nindicated that the scope and intensity of the search must be justified by the circumstances which rendered its\ninitiation permissible, the Supreme Court subsequently, in United States v. Robinson (1973), 414 U.S. 218, 38\nL.Ed.2d 427, 94 S.Ct. 467, and the companion case of Gustafson v. Florida (1973), 414 U.S. 260, 38 L.Ed.2d\n456, 94 S.Ct. 488, has not seen fit to so limit the authority to conduct a full search of the person incident to a\nlawful custodial arrest. In fact, the Robinson majority stated the \"general authority\" to search incident to a\n36 custodial arrest in absolute terms: \"Once there is a custodial arrest *36 a `full search of the person' requires no\n`additional justification.' [414 U.S. 218, 235, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 441, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477.]\" See 2 W. LaFave, Search\nand Seizure secs. 5.2(a), (b), at 262-70 (1978).\nIn People v. Hayes (1973), 55 Ill.2d 78, the defendant was arrested for a firearms violation and was searched and\na controlled substance was found on his person. This court held that the search was justified as incident to the\narrest. In People v. Holloman (1970), 46 Ill.2d 311, the defendant was arrested for not having a valid driver's\nlicense, and a search incident to the arrest was conducted, during which an envelope was discovered attached to\nhis back. The envelope contained a controlled substance. The search was held to be valid. Although neither of\nthese cases involved a strip search, the facts in Hayes are similar to those in our case, and the arrest in \nHolloman was for a much less serious offense. In light of these cases, it cannot be argued that the police could\nnot search the defendant's person. The question then is whether the search, although reasonable in its inception,\nbecame an unreasonable search because of its intensity.\nDefendant here emphasizes the degrading nature of a strip search and contends that such an invasion of his\nrights was not justified as incident to his arrest for what he terms a minor offense. Without a doubt, a strip search\nis a serious invasion of one's rights, and because of the intensity, when made following an arrest for certain minor\noffenses, could be viewed as a fourth amendment violation. In this case we need not decide the nature or\nboundaries of this limitation or how to apply it. Various suggestions have been made. (See 2 W. LaFave, Search\nand Seizure sec. 5.2(g), at 288-90 (1978).) However, even in such cases, a reasonable belief that the person\narrested has on his person a weapon or contraband may justify the intensive invasion of his privacy. In our case,\n37 however, we are dealing with a person who has been charged *37 with a weapons offense. Although a\nmisdemeanor, it is not a minor offense in the same sense that certain traffic offenses can be said to be minor\noffenses. It was sufficiently serious to require that the defendant be held at least until it could be determined\nwhether he should be charged with a felony. Although cursory searches had failed to disclose any additional\nweapons during the search at the scene of the arrest, or subsequently at the station, it was not unreasonable,\nunder the circumstances, to conduct a strip search at the police station.\nAs the dissenters in United States v. Robinson acknowledged:\n\"If the individual happens to have a weapon on his person, he will certainly have much more\nopportunity to use it against the officer in the in-custody situation. The prolonged proximity also\nmakes it more likely that the individual will be able to extricate any small hidden weapon which\nmight go undetected in a weapons frisk, such as a safety pin or razor blade. In addition, a suspect\ntaken into custody may feel more threatened by the serious restraint on his liberty * * * and may\ntherefore be more likely to resort to force.\" United States v. Robinson (1973), 414 U.S. 218, 254,\n38 L.Ed.2d 427, 451, 94 S.Ct. 467, 485 (Marshall, J., dissenting).\nOfficer Cronin testified that criminals usually conceal weapons or contraband where they are not easily detected.\nHe personally has found guns, knives, items of contraband and other evidence during strip searches that\nordinarily would not be found in a routine search. These items were found in undergarments, socks, and on the\nperson, primarily concealed in the crotch area. It was not necessary that Officer Cronin have probable cause to\nbelieve that the suspect had concealed on his person weapons that might be used to effect his escape or to harm\n\n38 himself or others. *38 The potential for danger inherent in the custodial arrest and the holding of the defendant in\nour case made the strip search reasonable. (See United States v. Chadwick (1977), 433 U.S. 1, 14-15, 53\nL.Ed.2d 538, 550, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2485.) By approving a strip search incident to the custodial arrest of the\ndefendant in this case we do not mean to adopt the broad language of United States v. Robinson and Gustafson\nv. Florida and do not permit the intensive intrusion of a strip search into one's privacy in all custodial arrests. In\nfact we here acknowledge that a strip search may be entirely unreasonable and a violation of constitutional rights\nwhen conducted incident to custodial arrests in certain situations. We are here saying only that the arrest in this\ncase was not one of those situations.\nAs noted earlier, it was necessary to hold the defendant for a period of time, possibly as long as two or three\nhours. If he had not been confined in the lockup, but had remained in the room where the traffic and disorderly\nconduct cases were being booked, and if he would have produced a weapon that had been well concealed, the\npolice would have been subject to deserved criticism if someone would have been injured or if the defendant\nwould have escaped. As noted, the dangers in the circumstances of a custodial arrest are sharply accentuated by\nthe prolonged proximity of the accused to police personnel and others following the arrest. The crucial\ndistinguishing feature of the custodial arrest is not the greater likelihood that a person taken into custody is\narmed, but rather the increased likelihood of danger to the officer and to others if in fact the person is armed. See\nUnited States v. Robinson (1973), 414 U.S. 218, 253, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 451, 94 S.Ct. 467, 485 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure sec. 5.2, at 278 (1978).\nSince it was necessary to hold the defendant until it could be ascertained whether he should be charged with a\n39 felony or a misdemeanor, for safety and security reasons it *39 was proper to hold him in the lockup. The officials\nin charge of the jail have a strong interest in preventing contraband drugs and especially weapons from entering\nthe lockup. Although one confined to a jail does not lose his constitutional rights, they are, nonetheless,\ndiminished by the needs of the institutional environment. See Bell v. Wolfish (1979), 441 U.S. 520, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447, 99 S.Ct. 1816; United States v. Lilly (5th Cir.1978), 576 F.2d 1240, 1244-46.\nThe trial court appears to have viewed this search only in relation to the incarceration of the defendant. That is,\nthe court felt that the defendant could have been detained for the time necessary to check his past conviction\nrecord without placing him in the lockup area of the police station. Therefore, the court reasons, no search was\njustified. Although we have held that the defendant was properly detained, the right to search him did not depend\nsolely upon whether or not he was detained in the lockup. The right to search the defendant also finds its\njustification as incident to his custodial arrest, which is distinct from the need to search one who is incarcerated in\norder to prevent weapons or contraband from entering the detention facility. There are, in fact, two justifications\nfor the search of the defendant, who was under custodial arrest and was properly detained in the lockup: (1) a\nsearch incident to a custodial arrest and (2) a search prior to incarceration to safeguard the detention facility.\nA strip search is no doubt a severe intrusion into one's privacy. Some contend that such a search should be\nauthorized only upon a showing of probable cause to believe that the suspect is concealing weapons or evidence\nwhich may be destroyed. (See Shuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J.\nMar. L. Rev. 273 (1980).) However, such searches have been approved as incident to an arrest without the\n40 showing of probable cause (see United States v. Klein (1st Cir. *40 1975), 522 F.2d 296) and as a search prior to\nincarceration. (See United States v. Tillery (E.D. Pa. 1971), 332 F. Supp. 217; 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure\nsec. 5.3, at 307 (1978).) In United States v. Klein the court held that a brief strip search of a defendant, conducted\nwithout abuse and in a professional manner, is not unconstitutional and stated that \"the modesty of one lawfully\narrested must give way to reasonable precautionary procedures designed to detect hidden evidence, drugs, or\nobjects which might be used against others or to cause self-inflicted harm.\" United States v. Klein (1st Cir.1975),\n522 F.2d 296, 300-01.\nSubsequent to the trial court order suppressing the evidence in this case, the General Assembly amended\nsection 103-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, par. 103-1). That section\nnow specifically deals with strip searches. By discussing the amendment we do not intend to construe it or to\npass on its validity. The amendment specifically prohibits strip searches of a person arrested \"for a traffic,\nregulatory or misdemeanor offense\" unless there is reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon\nor controlled substance. The amendment specifically excepts from this prohibition cases involving weapons or\n\ncontrolled substances. Thus, the search of the defendant in our case would have been authorized under\namended section 103-1. We need not decide whether the class of offenses in which the legislature has prohibited\nstrip searches are also offenses where such a search would violate fourth amendment rights. We simply note that\nwhere an arrest has been made on a weapons charge, a strip search is authorized by the amendment without the\nnecessity of having a reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon. Regardless of the\nconstitutional dimensions of the right to conduct a strip search incident to a custodial arrest, which we have\n41 herein found it unnecessary *41 to define, such searches conducted after September 21, 1979, the effective date\nof the amendment, will be governed by the limitations of section 103-1, unless, of course, a provision of that\nsection is found to be violative of constitutional rights.\nThe trial court, in granting the motion to suppress, stated that, once the defendant was at the police station, he\nshould have been informed that he was charged with a bailable offense and that the amount of the bail had been\nset by rule of court and inquiry should have been made of the defendant whether he could make bail before he\nwas incarcerated. The court stated that he should have been incarcerated only if he could not make bail and he\nshould have been subjected to further search only upon entering the lockup. We have dealt with these questions\nabove. The court did not address the question of a search incident to a lawful arrest. Under the law as set forth\nherein, and the facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence seized\nfollowing the strip search of the defendant.\nThe order of the circuit court of Cook County suppressing the evidence is reversed, as is the judgment of the\nappellate court affirming the order of the circuit court.\nReversed.\nMR.
