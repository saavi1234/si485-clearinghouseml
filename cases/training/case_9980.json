Plaintiff alleged that she was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a minor traffic violation (failure to have a child car seat) and then transported to the Winnebago County Jail where she was strip searched pursuant to the Jail's blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees regardless of whether there was any reasonable suspicion that the arrestee possessed contraband or weapons.

This is a civil rights class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants \nof rights secured to the Plaintiff and proposed class by the United States Constitution and \nthe laws ofthe United States of America.  Winnebago County and the Winnebago \nCounty SheritTs Office have had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the \nWinnebago County Jail and are booked into the facility, regardless of particularized \nsuspicion or cause.  Upon information and belief, this policy is derived from the written \nprocedures of the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office and was promulgated by senior \nofficials within that office; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Richard A. Meyers and \nDirector of Corrections John Doe. \n\n2.  It has been well established in this judicial district that individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent some level of particularized \nsuspicion or cuase to believe that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the \npolicy of Winnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office to force those \ncharged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip-search upon entry into the \nWinnebago County Jail is not only clearly illegal, but it is insensitive and unnecessary. \n3.  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of herself, and on behalf of a class of others \nwho were strip-searched after being charged with minor crimes, to vindicate the clear and \nunnecessary violation of her civil rights and those of the class members she proposes to \nrepresent.  She seeks monetary damages for herself and each member of the proposed \nclass, a declaration that the policy is unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding \nWinnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office from continuing to \nviolate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs \ncomplains as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n1331, 1341 &  1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU .S.c. 1981 &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of28 L.S.C. 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nconstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n\n5.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.c. 139J(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiff s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n6.  On or about January 8, 2007, Plaintiff Rosemary Raymundo was arrested at her \nhome in South Beloit, IL, on a warrant for failing to appear in court for charges of \ntransporting a child without an appropriate child restraint system (625 ILCS 25/4).  She \nwas first taken to the South Beloit police station and then taken to the Winnebago County \nJail. \n7.  Defendant Winnebago County is a county government organized and existing \nunder the laws of the State of Illinois.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting \nthrough its Sheriffs Office, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Winnebago County Jail and \nwas responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffs \nOffice personnel, including those working in the Winnebago County Jail.  In addition, at \nall relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Winnebago \nCounty Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffs Office personnel employed in the jail obeyed \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of Illinois. \n8.  Defendant Winnebago County Sheriffs Office (\"Sheriffs Office\") is a County \nSheri ff s Office organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois.  At all \ntimes relevant hereto, the Sheriffs Office was responsible for operating, organizing, \noverseeing and administering the Winnebago County Jail.  At all times relevant hereto, \nDefendant Sheriffs Office, together with Winnebago County, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \n\nthe Winnebago County Jail, and was responsible for the appointment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Office personnel, including those working at the \nWinnebago County Jail.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriffs \nOffice, together with Winnebago County, was responsible for enforcing the rules of \nWinnebago County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffs Office personnel employed in the \nWinnebago County Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the \nState of Illinois. \n9.  Defendant Richard A. Meyers (\"Sheriff Meyers\") is the duly elected Sheriff of \nWinnebago County, and, as such, is a policy-maker who created and/or implemented an \nunconstitutional policy with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over \nwhich the Winnebago County Jail exercises custodial or other control.  Sheriff Meyers is \nmade a defendant in this action in his individual and official capacities. \n10.  Defendant John Doe (\"Director of Corrections Doe\") is the duly appointed \nDirector of Corrections of the Winnebago County Sheriff s Office and is the officer in \ncharge of the operation of the Winnebago County Jail.  As such, Director of Corrections \nDoe is a policy maker who created and/or implemented an unconstitutional policy  with \nrespect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the Winnebago \nCounty Jail exercises custodial or other control.  Director of Corrections Doe is made a \ndefendant in this action in his individual and official capacities. \n11.  Collectively, Sheriff Meyers and Director of Corrections Doe will be referred to \nas the \"Policy Making Defendants.\" \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n\n12.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were strip-searched without particularized justification upon their entry \ninto the Winnebago County Jail. \n13.  The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be strip-searched without any particularized \njustification upon their being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office \nand Winnebago County.  Specifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants \nand all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or \nassIgnees. \n14.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n15.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are scores of people arrested for minor crimes who are \nplaced into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail every month - all whom are \nmembers of the proposed class. \n16.  Upon information and belief~ joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside \nof Winnebago County and this judicial district.  Futhermore, upon information and belief, \n\nmany members of the calss are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely \nwould have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n17.  COIlil1I011 questions oflaw and fact exist as to all members of the class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip-searches absent particularized justification.  All members of the class \nwere illegally strip-searched without particularized justification upon entering the \nWinnebago County Jail in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial district. \n18.  Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the proposed class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff is typical of the harms suffered by \nthe class members. \n19.  The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Plaintiff has \nno interest that is adverse to the interests of the members of the class. \n20.  Plaintiffs counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to successfully \nprosecute th is action against the Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knmvs of no conflicts \namong members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n21.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(2), in that all class members were \nsubjected to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches without particularized \njustification upon being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail.  In ShOli, \nWinnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office and the Policy Making \nDefendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members. \n\n22.  In addition to celiification under Rule 23(b )(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n23.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class.  These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or defacto policy of strip \nsearching without particularized justification all individuals placed into the custody of the \nWinnebago County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de Jacto policy existed. \n24.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and since they are \ndispersed over a large geographical area.  Futhermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members ofthe \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this district presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the class. \n25.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of the Plaintiff and the proposed class. \n\n26.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n27.  Finally, Plaintiff seeks the certification of a limited fund class action pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(1 )(B) for the purposes of assessing punitive damages against the \nPolicy Making Defendants.  The prohibition against strip-searching without \nparticularized justification has been established in this Judicial circuit for several years, \nand with good reason: Subjecting someone to the indignity of a strip-search is only \nappropriate where there exists some particularized suspicion or cause to believe that the \nindividual possesses weapons or contraband. \n28.  This action is a textbook example of when punitive damages should be imposed \non those in charge of a local correctional facility.  The Policy Making Defendants, \nhowever, have limited personal assets that would quickly be exhausted upon the \nimposition of punitive damages in only a few cases.  As all members of the proposed \nclass deserve to equally share in the assets of the Policy Making Defendants, the \ncertification of a limited fund punitive damages class is appropriate, with the Court, after \nverdict, to establish this limited fund from the liquidated assets of the Policy Making \nDefendants and distribute the fund to all members of the class. \nFACTS \n29.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they \nsupervise, from performing strip-searches of arrestees unless the officer has \nparticularized suspicion or cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or \ncontraband. \n\n30.  Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriffs Office and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto pol icy, custom or practice of strip-searching without particularized justification all \nindividuals who enter into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime and without the presence of particularized suspicion or \ncause to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n31.  Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriffs Office and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching without particularized justification all \nindividuals who enter the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, regardless of the \nindividual characteristics of the nature of their charged crime. \n32.  Winnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy or practice of conducting strip-searches without particularized justification.  This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip-search individuals \nwithout particularized justification, with this principle being clearly established in John \nDoe, et at. v. Calumet City, Illinois, et at. (754 F.Supp. 1211). \n33.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip-searches without particularized justification has been promulgated, \neffectuated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n\n34.  Particluarized justification to conduct a strip-search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n35.  Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriff's Office and the Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or \ndefacto policy made the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip-searches. \n36.  Pursuant to this written and/or defacto policy, each member of the class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, were victims of a routine strip-search upon their entry into \nthe Winnebago County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of particularized justification, and in fact were not supported by \nparticularized justification. \n37.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de[acto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches - each \nmember of the class, including the named Plaintiff - have suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts applicable to the Named Plaintiff \n\n38.  Ms. Raymundo's experience is representative.  On or about January 8, 2007, \nRosemary Raymundo was arrested at her home in South Beloit, IL.  She was picked up \non a warrant for failing to appear for a court date on charges oftransporting a child \nwithout an appropriate child restraint system (625 ILCS 2514). \n39.  Plaintiff Raymundo was initially transported to the South Beloit Police Station \nand subsequently transported to the Winnebago County Jail. \n40.  Upon being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, Plaintiff \nRaymundo was strip searched.  Two women correctional guards ordered her to remove \nher clothing.  Once removed, Plaintiff was ordered to spread her cheeks and cough.  At \nno time did anyone ask if Plaintiff consented to this search, and at no time to Plaintiff \ngive consent for this search. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI: Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law-\n41.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above. \n42.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip-searches without particularized reason to believe that the individual in \nquestion has either contraband or weapons. \n43.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff s rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Winnebago \n\nCounty Corrections Officers to strip-search Plaintiff and class members without \nparticularized justification.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to order/direct Winnebago County Corrections Officers to conduct such \nsearches. \n44.  These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nWinnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office.  As such, Winnebago \nCounty and the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office are directly liable for the damages of \nthe named Plaintiff and member of the class. \n45.  Upon information and belief, Sheriff Meyers and Director of Corrections Doe are \nresponsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of \nthe Winnebago County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip \nsearch policy questioned in the lawsuit.  As such, Meyers and Doe are each individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the class. \n46.  Sheriff Meyers and Director of Corrections Doe knew that the strip-search policy \nwas illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff \nand members of the class of their constitutional rights. \n47.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.c. \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n48.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and proposed class members have been irreparably injured. \nII: Demand for Declaratory Judgement \n49.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above. \n\n50.  The policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office, \nWinnebago County and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Winnebago County Jail without any particularized justification. \n51 .  Plai nti ff and members of the class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip-search policy of Winnebago County and the \nWinnebago County Sheriff's Office to be unconstitutional. \nIII: Demand for Preliminary and Premanent Injunction \n52.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above. \n53.  The policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office, \nWinnebago County and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Winnebago County Jail without any particularized justification. \n54.  Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Winnebago \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members ofthe class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff. \n55.  The continuing pattern of strip-searching individuals without particularized \njustification will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the \nclass, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n56.  Plaintiffs demand that Winnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffs \nOffice, the Policy Making Defendants and Winnebago County Corrections Officers \nimmediately desist from strip-searching individuals placed into the custody of the \n\nWinnebago County Jail absent any particularized justification, and seek both a \npreliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much. \nIV: Against Defendants Winnebago County, The Winnebago County Sheriff's \nOffice, Sheriff Meyers, and Director of Corrections Doe \n--Deliberate Indifference to Training and Supervision--\n57.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above. \n58.  The above-named Defendants were deliberately indifferent in the training and \nsupervision of the individual corrections officers employed at the Winnebago County \nJail, in that Defendants were deliberately indifferent in discharging their duty to make \nsure that any strip-searches conducted at the Winnebago County Jail were performed only \nin circumstances permitted by the United States Constitution. \n59.  The above-named Defendants knew, or should have known, that unconstitutional \nstrip-searches were, or likely to be, taking place in the Winnebago County Jail. \n60.  Despite this knowledge, the above-named Defendants did not act to stop these \nunconstitutional practices from occurring. \n61.  This conduct on the part of the above-named Defendants represents a violation of \n42 U.S.c. 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under the color of state law. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintifTs have been irreparably injured. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n63.  The actions of the individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey continue to propagate an illegal strip-search policy even though they know that their \n\nactions are unconstitutional.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish the Policy Making Defendants. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n64.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and on behalf of a class of others \nsimilarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \nI.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \n2.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffs First Cause \nof Action detailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to the named Plaintiff and \neach member of the proposed class. \n3.  A judgment against Defendant Sheriff Meyers on Plaintiffs First Cause of Action \nfor $1,000,000 in punitive damages. \n4.  A judgment against Defendant Director of Corrections Doe on Plaintiff s First \nCause of Action for $1,000,000 in punitive damages. \n5.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring Winnebago County's \nand the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office's policy, practice and custom of strip \nsearching all detainees entering the Winnebago County Jail without particularized \njustification and regardless ofthe crime charged or suspicion of contraband or weapons, \nto be unconstitutional and improper. \n6.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to \nstrip-search individuals without particularized justification. \n\n7.  A monetary award for attorneys' fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. 1988. \nRespectfully submitted, \nI \nS-)  It( \nOJ \nDated: \nChicab, Illinois \nJames R.

This is a civil rights class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants \nof rights secured to the Plaintiff and proposed class by the United States Constitution and \nthe laws of the United States of America.  Winnebago County and the Winnebago \nCounty Sheriffโs Office have had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the \nWinnebago County Jail and are booked into the facility, regardless of particularized \nsuspicion or cause.  Upon information and belief, this policy is derived from the written \nprocedures of the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office and was promulgated by senior \nofficials within that office; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Richard A. Meyers and Jail \nSuperintendent Andrea Tack.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 027 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 2e IoDf  1#6:75\n2. It has been well established in this judicial district that individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent some level of particularized\nsuspicion or cause to believe that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the \npolicy of Winnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office to force those \ncharged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip-search upon entry into the \nWinnebago County Jail is not only clearly illegal, but it is insensitive and unnecessary.\n3. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of herself, and on behalf of a class of others \nwho were strip-searched after being charged with minor crimes, to vindicate the clear and \nunnecessary violation of her civil rights and those of the class members she proposes to \nrepresent.  She seeks monetary damages for herself and each member of the proposed \nclass, a declaration that the policyis unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding \nWinnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office from continuing to \nviolate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiffs\ncomplains as follows:\nJURISDICTION\n4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nconstitutionality of the policies of a local government.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 037 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 3e IoDf  1#6:76\n5. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiffโs claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district.\nPARTIES\n6. On or about January 8, 2007, Plaintiff Rosemary Raymundo was arrested at her \nhome in South Beloit, WI, on a warrant for failing to appear in court for charges of \ntransporting a child without an appropriate child restraint system (625 ILCS 25/4).  She \nwas first taken to the South Beloit police station and then taken to the Winnebago County\nJail.\n7. Defendant Winnebago County is a county government organized and existing \nunder the laws of the State of Illinois.  At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting \nthrough its Sheriffโs Office, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Winnebago County Jail and \nwas responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffโs \nOffice personnel, including those working in the Winnebago County Jail.  In addition, at \nall relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Winnebago \nCounty Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffโs Office personnel employed in the jail obeyed \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of Illinois.\n8. Defendant Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office (โSheriffโs Officeโ) is a County \nSheriffโs Office organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois.  At all \ntimes relevant hereto, the Sheriffโs Office was responsible for operating, organizing, \noverseeing and administering the Winnebago County Jail.  At all times relevant hereto, \nDefendant Sheriffโs Office, together with Winnebago County, was responsible for the \npolicies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to \n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 047 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 4e IoDf  1#6:77\nthe Winnebago County Jail, and was responsible for the appointment, training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriffโs Office personnel, including those working at the \nWinnebago County Jail.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriffโs \nOffice, together with Winnebago County, was responsible for enforcing the rules of \nWinnebago County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffโs Office personnel employed in the \nWinnebago County Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the \nState of Illinois.\n9. Defendant Richard A. Meyers (โSheriff Meyersโ) is the duly elected Sheriff of \nWinnebago County, and, as such, is a policy-maker who created and/or implemented an \nunconstitutional policy with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over \nwhich the Winnebago County Jail exercises custodial or other control.  Sheriff Meyers is \nmade a defendant in this action in his individual and official capacities.\n10. Defendant Andrea Tack (โJail Superintendent Tackโ) is the duly appointed \nDirector of Corrections of the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office and is the officer in \ncharge of the operation of the Winnebago County Jail.  As such, Jail Superintendent Tack\nis a policy maker who created and/or implemented an unconstitutional policy with respect \nto the treatment of pre-trial and other detainees over which the Winnebago County Jail \nexercises custodial or other control.  Jail Superintendent Tack is made a defendant in this \naction in her individual and official capacities.\n11. Collectively, Sheriff Meyers and Jail Superintendent Tack will be referred to as \nthe โPolicy Making Defendants.โ\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 057 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 5e IoDf  1#6:78\n12. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated \nindividuals who were strip-searched without particularized justification upon their entry \ninto the Winnebago County Jail.\n13. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows:\nAll persons who have been or will be strip-searched without any particularized \njustification upon their being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail \npursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office \nand Winnebago County.  Specifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants \nand all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or \nassignees.\n14. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).\n15. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief, there are scores of people arrested for minor crimes who are \nplaced into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail every month โ all whom are \nmembers of the proposed class.\n16. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside \nof Winnebago County and this judicial district.  Futhermore, upon information and belief, \n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 067 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 6e IoDf  1#6:79\nmany members of the calss are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely \nwould have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.\n17. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendantsโ \nconducting strip-searches absent particularized justification.  All members of the class \nwere illegally strip-searched without particularized justification upon entering the \nWinnebago County Jail in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial district.\n18. Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the proposed class.  \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendantsโ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff is typical of the harms suffered by \nthe class members.\n19. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  Plaintiff has \nno interest that is adverse to the interests of the members of the class.\n20. Plaintiffโs counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to successfully \nprosecute this action against the Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no conflicts \namong members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class.\n21. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the Plaintiff \nseeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(2), in that all class members were \nsubjected to the same policy requiring the illegal strip-searches without particularized \njustification upon being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail.  In short, \nWinnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office and the Policy Making \nDefendants acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 077 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 7e IoDf  1#6:80\n22. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3).\n23. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class.  These \ncommon questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy of strip-\nsearching without particularized justification all individuals placed into the custody of the \nWinnebago County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed.\n24. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and since they are \ndispersed over a large geographical area.  Futhermore, the expense and burden of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this district presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the class.\n25. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendantsโ flagrant violation of the civil rights of the Plaintiff and the proposed class.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 087 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 8e IoDf  1#6:81\n26. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).\n27. Finally, Plaintiff seeks the certification of a limited fund class action pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(B) for the purposes of assessing punitive damages against the \nPolicy Making Defendants.  The prohibition against strip-searching without \nparticularized justification has been established in this judicial circuit for several years, \nand with good reason: Subjecting someone to the indignity of a strip-search is only \nappropriate where thereexists some particularized suspicion or cause to believe that the \nindividual possesses weapons or contraband.\n28. This action is a textbook example of when punitive damages should be imposed \non those in charge of a local correctional facility.  The Policy Making Defendants, \nhowever, have limited personal assets that would quickly be exhausted upon the \nimposition of punitive damages in only a few cases.  As all members of the proposed \nclass deserve to equally share in the assets of the Policy Making Defendants, the \ncertification of a limited fund punitive damages class is appropriate, with the Court, after \nverdict, to establish this limited fund from the liquidated assets of the Policy Making \nDefendants and distribute the fund to all members of the class.\nFACTS\n29. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they \nsupervise, from performing strip-searches of arrestees unless the officer has \nparticularized suspicion or cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or \ncontraband.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 097 o  f   1 P6a Pgaeg 9e IoDf  1#6:82\n30. Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriffโs Office and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching without particularized justification all \nindividuals who enter into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime and without the presence of particularized suspicion or \ncause to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.\n31. Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriffโs Office and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and or de \nfacto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching without particularized justification all \nindividuals who enter the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, regardless of the \nindividual characteristics of the nature of their charged crime.\n32. Winnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a \npolicy or practice of conducting strip-searches without particularized justification.  This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip-search individuals \nwithout particularized justification, with this principle being clearly established in John \nDoe, et al. v. Calumet City, Illinois, et al. (754 F.Supp. 1211).\n33. The Defendantsโ written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale strip-searches without particularized justification has been promulgated, \neffectuated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0170   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g0e IoDf  1#6:83\n34. Particluarized justification to conduct a strip-search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n35. Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County \nSheriffโs Office and the Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a policy, practice or custom of strip-searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail without any \nrequirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or \nde facto policy made the strip-searching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature \nof the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a \nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of \nroutine strip-searches.\n36. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, were victims of a routine strip-search upon their entry into \nthe Winnebago County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of particularized justification, and in fact were not supported by \nparticularized justification.\n37. As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip-searches conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip-searches โ each \nmember of the class, including the named Plaintiff โ have suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nFacts applicable to the Named Plaintiff\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0171   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g1e IoDf  1#6:84\n38. Ms. Raymundoโs experience is representative.  On or about January 8, 2007, \nRosemary Raymundo was arrested at her home in South Beloit, WI.  She was picked up \non a warrant for failing to appear for a court date on charges of transporting a child \nwithout an appropriate child restraint system (625 ILCS 25/4).\n39. Plaintiff Raymundo was initially transported to the South Beloit Police Station \nand subsequently transported to the Winnebago County Jail.\n40. Upon being placed into the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, Plaintiff \nRaymundo was strip searched.  Two women correctional guards ordered her to remove \nher clothing.  Once removed, Plaintiff was ordered to squat and to spread her cheeks and \ncough. Plaintiff was also ordered to spread her vagina.  One or more of the correctional \nguards then lifted Plaintiffโs breasts.  At no time did anyone ask if Plaintiff consented to \nthis search, and at no time to Plaintiff give consent for this search.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\nI: Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law\n--Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Lawโ\n41. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above.\n42. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip-searches without particularized reason to believe that the individual in \nquestion has either contraband or weapons.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0172   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g2e IoDf  1#6:85\n43. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffโs rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Winnebago \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip-search Plaintiff and class members without \nparticularized justification.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to order/direct Winnebago County Corrections Officers to conduct such \nsearches.\n44. These strip-searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of \nWinnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office.  As such, Winnebago \nCounty and the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office are directly liable for the damages of \nthe named Plaintiff and member of the class.\n45. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Meyers and Jail Superintendent Tack are \nresponsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation of \nthe Winnebago County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip-\nsearch policy questioned in the lawsuit.  As such, Meyers and Tack are each individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the class.\n46. Sheriff Meyers and Director of Corrections Doe knew that the strip-search policy \nwas illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive Plaintiff \nand members of the class of their constitutional rights.\n47. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.\n48. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and proposed class members have been irreparably injured.\nII: Demand for Declaratory Judgement\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0173   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g3e IoDf  1#6:86\n49. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above.\n50. The policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office, \nWinnebago County and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Winnebago County Jail without any particularized justification.\n51. Plaintiff and members of the class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip-search policy of Winnebago County and the \nWinnebago County Sheriffโs Office to be unconstitutional.\nIII: Demand for Preliminary and Premanent Injunction\n52. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above.\n53. The policy, custom and practice of the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Office, \nWinnebago County and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that \nthese entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip-searches of all individuals \nplaced into the Winnebago County Jail without any particularized justification.\n54. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Winnebago \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff.\n55. The continuing pattern of strip-searching individuals without particularized \njustification will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the \nclass, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0174   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g4e IoDf  1#6:87\n56. Plaintiffs demand that Winnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriffโs \nOffice, the Policy Making Defendants and Winnebago County Corrections Officers \nimmediately desist from strip-searching individuals placed into the custody of the \nWinnebago County Jail absent any particularized justification, and seek both a \npreliminary and permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much.\nIV: Against Defendants Winnebago County, The Winnebago County Sheriffโs \nOffice, Sheriff Meyers, and Director of Corrections Doe\n--Deliberate Indifference to Training and Supervision--\n57. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realege each and every allegation stated in \nthe paragraphs above.\n58. The above-named Defendants were deliberately indifferent in the training and \nsupervision of the individual corrections officers employed at the Winnebago County\nJail, in that Defendants were deliberately indifferent in discharging their duty to make \nsure that any strip-searches conducted at the Winnebago County Jail were performed only \nin circumstances permitted by the United States Constitution.\n59. The above-named Defendants knew, or should have known, that unconstitutional \nstrip-searches were, or likely to be, taking place in the Winnebago County Jail.\n60. Despite this knowledge, the above-named Defendants did not act to stop these \nunconstitutional practices from occurring.\n61. This conduct on the part of the above-named Defendants represents a violation of \n42 U.S.C. 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under the color of state law.\n62. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0175   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g5e IoDf  1#6:88\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n63. The actions of the individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey continue to propagate an illegal strip-search policy even though they know that their \nactions are unconstitutional.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to \npunish the Policy Making Defendants.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n64. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and on behalf of a class of others \nsimilarly situated, requests that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief:\n1. An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n2. A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiffโs First Cause \nof Action detailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to the named Plaintiff and \neach member of the proposed class.\n3. A judgment against Defendant Sheriff Meyers on Plaintiffโs First Cause of Action \nfor $1,000,000 in punitive damages.\n4. A judgment against Defendant Director of Corrections Doe on Plaintiffโs First \nCause of Action for $1,000,000 in punitive damages.\n5. A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring Winnebago Countyโs \nand the Winnebago County Sheriffโs Officeโs policy, practice and custom of strip-\nsearching all detainees entering the Winnebago County Jail without particularized \njustification and regardless of the crime charged or suspicion of contraband or weapons, \nto be unconstitutional and improper.\n\nCaCsaes: e3 :30:70-7c-vc-v5-05008078 7D  o  c Dumoceunmt #e:n 2t 11 3F-i2le  d  :   1F0il/e2d6 /1007/ 0P5a/g2e0 0176   o  f  P1a6g Pea 1g6e IoDf  1#6:89\n6.
