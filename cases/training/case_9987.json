    "summary": "<p>On October 9, 2003, plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against Cook County, the Cook County Sheriff, the Cook County Department of Corrections Director, the Cook County Department of Public Health Director, and the Cermak Health Services of Cook County Chief Operating Officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff, an attorney proceeding pro se and then represented by private counsel, sought declaratory, compensatory, and injunctive relief, claiming he was the victim of an unreasonable visual cavity search and a urethral swabbing test in violation of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiff alleged state law violations of assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p><p>Specifically, on October 9, 2002, a judge found plaintiff in civil contempt and Sheriff's deputies took plaintiff to the Cook County Jail. Defendants claimed, but plaintiff denied, that plaintiff signed a \"consent for [medical] treatment\" form. Plaintiff alleged he was not informed of his right to refuse the urethral swab test and was unaware of what medical tests would be performed during intake and therefore could not consent. Plaintiff alleged that a doctor threatened the inmates, saying, \"you don't want to piss-off the dick doctor,\" prior to the test. Then Sheriff's deputies did a visual body cavity search of plaintiff in a group of 40-50 inmates.</p><p>On August 8, 2005, the Court (U.S. District Court Judge Matthew F. Kennelly) denied summary judgment to defendants and found that plaintiff could proceed under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, but not under the Eighth Amendment, which does not apply to pretrial detainees. The Court held: (1) There were fact issues as to whether visual cavity searches were necessary for all incoming inmates and Sheriff's deputies had no reasonable suspicion that plaintiff concealed contraband. (2) There were fact issues as to whether urethral swabbing of all inmates violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights because the consent form did not state that the health screening included an invasive test. Furthermore, defendants did not provide evidence of STDs in the jail and the urethral swabbing was not conducted in private. Thompson v. County of Cook, 412 F. Supp. 2d 881 (N.D. Ill. 2005). </p><p>On January 31, 2006, jury trial began before U.S. District Court Judge Kennelly.</p><p>On February 7, 2006, the Court (U.S. District Court Judge Kennelly) dismissed the claims against Defendant Cook County as to the strip search and dismissed claims against Defendant Sheriff as to the urethral swab test. Plaintiff previously withdrew his state law claims. The jury then found for defendants on all remaining counts.</p><p>On February 21, 2006, plaintiff moved for a new trial.</p><p>On April 18, 2006, the Court (U.S. District Court Judge Kennelly) granted a new trial as to the strip search because the jury's verdict as to the body cavity search was against the weight of the evidence. The search was unreasonable because Sheriff's deputies had no reasonable suspicion that plaintiff concealed contraband. The Court affirmed the verdict for defendants as to the urethral swabbing procedure because the Court found that plaintiff had consented to the procedure. Thompson v. County of Cook, 428 F.Supp.2d 807 (N.D. Ill. 2006).</p><p>On March 29, 2007, the Court (Judge Kennelly) dismissed the case pursuant to a stipulation.</p><p></p>",

Bersky, Chief Operating Officer, Cermak Health Services of\nCook County, in his official capacity, Defendants.\nNo. 03 C 7172.\nUnited States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Eastern Division.\nAugust 8, 2005.\n882 *882 Lawrence E. Thompson, Orland Park, IL, pro se.\nFrancis J. Catania, John A. Ouska, Cook County State's Attorney, Chicago, IL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nKENNELLY, District Judge.\nIn this lawsuit, Lawrence Thompson, an attorney proceeding pro se, contends that upon being incarcerated after\nbeing found in civil contempt by a Cook County judge, he was forced by Cook County personnel to submit to a\nvisual cavity strip search and to undergo a urethral swabbing test which involved insertion of a metal rod with a\nswab on the end into his penis. Thompson claims that these procedures violated his Fourth Amendment, Eighth\nAmendment, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. For the\n883 reasons outlined *883 below, the Court denies the defendants' motion.\nFacts\nOn October 9, 2002, a Circuit Court of Cook County judge found Thompson in civil contempt when he refused to\nsign certain documents related to his pending divorce proceedings and ordered him held in custody until he\nsigned the documents. See Pl's Ex. B. A Cook County Sheriff's deputy took Thompson into custody and searched\nhim at the courthouse. Thompson was later transported to the Cook County Jail. Upon his arrival at the jail,\nThompson was processed along with approximately 250 other new inmates. It is likely that most, if not all, of the\nothers were pretrial detainees, that is, persons charged with crimes awaiting trial.\nAfter spending some time in a holding pen, Thompson and the others were given identification cards and were\nphotographed. Thompson was then interviewed by a Cermak Health Services employee, who asked him medical\nscreening questions. The defendants maintain that during this interview, Thompson responded to questions on a\nstandard form concerning his medical history and current problems and signed the following \"consent for\ntreatment\" portion of the form:\nI consent to a medical and mental health history and physical including screening for tuberculosis\nand sexually transmitted diseases as part of the intake process of the Cook County Jail. I also\nconsent to ongoing medical treatment by Cermak Health Services staff for problems identified\nduring this process. I understand I may be asked to sign forms allowing other medical treatments.\nI understand that every effort will be made by CHS staff to keep my medical problems confidential.\nI understand the policy of CHS regarding access to health care at Cook County Jail.\n\nThompson Dep. Ex. 1. Thompson acknowledges that the medical intake form produced by the defendants\naccurately reflects his medical history and current conditions. Though he has no independent recollection of the\nexact questions he was asked, he testified that the questions on the form appear to be the type of questions he\nwas asked during intake. He likewise agrees that the signature on the medical intake form looks like his\nsignature. Thompson denies, however, that it is his signature and says he had never seen the medical intake\nform before it was produced during discovery in this matter.\nThe defendants claim that during the interview, Charles Kinnerk, the employee they say conducted the interview,\n[1]\n informed Thompson of his right to refuse the medical screening. Kinnerk testified that he believed the medical\nintake form informed inmates of their right to refuse consent and that he informs inmates of the existence of a\nrefusal to consent form. Kinnerk Dep. at 22-23. According to Kinnerk, if an inmate refuses to consent, he notes\n\"patient refused\" on the signature line, and the inmate fills out a refusal of medical treatment form. Id. at 12, 52.\nThompson denies that anyone ever informed him of his right to refuse consent.\nFollowing this brief interview, Thompson's personal property was inventoried. Next, he and the inmates\nunderwent a urethral swabbing procedure. According to Thompson, a man who was smoking a cigarette and\nreferred to himself as the \"dick doctor\" addressed the group, making various threats, such as \"you don't want to\n884 piss-off the dick doctor.\" Thompson Supp. Aff. ยถ 14. The inmates, who were in a *884 single file line, went into the\nroom one at a time for the procedure. The prisoner next in line waited at the threshold of the open door while the\ntest was administered to the prisoner in front of him. Thompson testified that when it was his turn, the individual\nperforming the procedure directed him to take out his penis and hang it over a garbage can and then inserted a\nmetal rod into his urethra. He claims he felt pain both during and after the procedure.\nThe defendants assert that in 2002, it was the policy of Cermak Health Services, in conjunction with the Cook\nCounty Department of Health and the City of Chicago Department of Health, to conduct urethral swabbing on\nmale detainees entering Cook County Jail to screen for syphilis and chlamydia. The defendants aver that this\njoint project was developed for purposes of promoting the health of inmates even after they are discharged from\nthe Department of Corrections. Dr. John Raba, the Chief Operating Officer of Cermak Health Services, testified\nthat the test involves inserting a thin swab a short distance into the urethra and gently rotating it to collect any\norganisms or inflammatory cells. Raba Aff. ยถ 3. Dr. Raba described this as a minimally invasive medical\nprocedure that is very safe and rarely causes even minimal injury to the human body. Id. However, he\nacknowledged that the procedure may cause some discomfort during and for a short time after the test. Id.\nDr. Raba also stated that it was the policy of Cermak Health Services to obtain medical consent for the procedure\nin the form of the medical intake forms. Id. at ยถ 5. Though the defendants did not produce any completed refusal\nto consent forms, they maintain that fewer than ten inmates a year refuse the urethral swabbing procedure. Def's\n56.1 Stmt. ยถ 28. Thompson acknowledges that he did not verbally refuse to undergo the procedure. But he\ncontends that prior to the urethral swabbing procedure, he was unaware of what medical tests would be\nperformed as part of the intake process and thus could not have provided informed consent. The defendants\nclaim that there is a sign in the room where the urethral swabbing procedure occurs that describes the procedure.\nSee Kinnerk Dep. at 13-14.\nAfter the urethral swabbing, Thompson and the other inmates received a chest x-ray and had blood drawn.\nThough Thompson maintains that he did not consent to these procedures, they do not form part of his complaint\nin this case.\nFinally, the inmates were escorted into a receiving tunnel00a hallway that is approximately ten feet wide and 100\n97\nyards long00 in groups of forty to fifty at a time. The parties appear to be in agreement concerning the details of\n97\n[2]\nthe subsequent strip/visual body cavity search.  Thompson and the others were lined up on both sides of the\nhallway with their backs against the wall and ordered by Department of Corrections officers to take off all their\n885 clothes and *885 place them on the ground in front of them. As a number of officers watched, Thompson and the\nothers were told to face the wall, reach high up on the wall, and run their fingers through their hair. They were\nthen instructed to bend over and spread their buttocks00a position they had to maintain until an officer was able to\n97\n\nobserve each inmate. Thompson Dep. at 57-58. No prisoners were physically touched during this process. After\nbeing ordered to hold up each item of clothing for inspection, the inmates were allowed to get dressed.\nThompson contends that the visual cavity search violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against\nunreasonable searches. He also maintains that because he did not consent to the urethral swabbing, the\ndefendants subjected him to that test in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, his due process right to be free\nfrom unjustified intrusions into his body and to refuse unwanted medical treatment, and the Eighth Amendment's\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThompson sues Cook County and four Cook County administrators in their official capacities. The defendants are\nMichael Sheahan, the Sheriff of Cook County; Callie Baird, the Director of the Cook County Department of\nCorrections; Ruth Rothstein, the Director of the Cook County Department of Public Health; and Leonard Bersky,\nthe Chief Operating Officer of Cermak Health Services.\nDiscussion\nSummary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,\nthe Court must construe all facts and draw all reasonable and justifiable inferences in favor of Thompson, the\nnon-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nThe defendants' motion presents two issues for consideration: first, whether Thompson has brought suit against\nthe appropriate defendants, and second, whether the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on\nthe merits of Thompson's claims.\n1. The named defendants' liability\nThe defendants contend that Thompson has failed to show personal involvement by any of the defendants in the\nalleged constitutional deprivations and thus may not prevail in a ยง 1983 claim against any of the individuals\nnamed. The defendants correctly point out that the doctrine of respondeat superior cannot be used to hold a\nsupervisor liable for a subordinate's violation of plaintiff's constitutional rights. See Chavez v. Illinois State Police,\n251 F.3d 612, 651 (7th Cir.2001). Thompson, however, has not sued the defendants in their individual capacities.\nInstead, he seeks to hold each defendant liable in his or her official capacity. Official capacity suits are, \"in all\nrespects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity. . . . for the real party in interest is the entity.\" \nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). A governmental entity is subject\nto ยง 1983 liability only if a policy or custom of the entity caused the constitutional deprivation. Monell v. Dept. of\nSocial Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\n886 The record does not reflect the existence of a written policy requiring incoming detainees, *886 including those\nimprisoned for contempt, to undergo a visual cavity search as part of the intake process. But the defendants\nadmit that a security strip search was conducted on all incoming detainees and prisoners at the Cook County Jail.\nDef's 56.1 Resp. ยถ 1. Similarly, Daniel Brown, Superintendent of the Cook County Department of Corrections,\ntestified that all inmates going through intake receive the same type of search. Brown Dep. at 32. Moreover, each\nside appears to agree on the scope of the search conducted. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence to permit\nThompson to proceed on his official capacity claims regarding the visual cavity search; the defendants are not\nentitled to summary judgment on this ground.\nWith respect to the urethral swabbing procedure, it is not crystal clear that a policy existed in October 2002\nmandating urethral swabbing for all males entering the Cook County Jail. Cermak Health Services Policy No.\n01-08B-01, effective January 2000, states that \"Screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) is available\nupon incarceration.\" Cermak Health Services, Infection Control Program, Policy No. 01-08B-01 (emphasis\nadded). The defendants also produced a March 2003 version of a written policy titled \"Sexually Transmitted\nDisease Program\" which provides that \"All individuals entering CCDOC will be screened for sexually transmitted\n\ndiseases. The procedure for testing is to be explained to each individual undergoing testing.\" Cermak Health\nServices, Sexually Transmitted Disease Program, Policy No. 01-08E-41. One of the procedures listed in this\npolicy is urethral swabbing. Though the version of the policy produced by the defendants was a revision that\npost-dates Thompson's processing, it lists the policy's date of origin as July 1984. Though the defendants have\nnot supplied the Court with the version of this policy in place at the time of Thompson's incarceration, for present\npurposes we believe it reasonable to infer that a similar policy existed at that time. And even were this not the\ncase, the circumstances surrounding Thompson's own processing permit a reasonable inference that the Cook\nCounty personnel were acting pursuant to an established policy with regard to the urethral swabbing.\nThompson claims that the swabbing was conducted without his knowing or voluntary consent. As indicated\nearlier, Dr. Raba testified that Cermak Health Services' policy was to obtain consent from new inmates via the\nmedical intake form. Raba Aff. ยถ 5. The consent portion of this form, however, does not mention that what it calls\n\"screening\" for sexually transmitted diseases would include an invasive test. The defendants also contend that a\nsign in the room where the swabbing procedure occurred provided inmates with information about the procedure.\nHowever, none of the signs produced by the defendants provide any such information. Pl's Supp. Aff. Ex. D. In\nany event, inmates would not have had access to this sign until they were actually in the room awaiting the\nprocedure, after they had already signed the consent form. In addition, Charles Kinnerk testified that if Cermak\nHealth Services is short-staffed, inmates sometimes undergo the urethral swabbing before signing the consent\nform. Kinnerk Dep. at 37.\nGiven all the circumstances, a jury reasonably could find that the County had an established custom or practice\nof conducting urethral swabbing tests on detainees without obtaining voluntary consent. As with the visual body\ncavity scan, there is sufficient evidence for Thompson to pursue an official capacity claim against the defendants\nregarding the claim of unconsented urethral swabbing.\n887 *887 2. The applicable constitutional provisions\nThompson asserts claims under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The Eighth Amendment's\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment applies only to prisoners incarcerated after an adjudication of guilt\nregarding a criminal offense. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nPersons convicted of a crime, including those found in criminal contempt, may be punished by the state, id. at\n535 n. 16 & 535 n. 17, 99 S.Ct. 1861, so long as the punishment has some penological justification and does riot\namount to the gratuitous infliction of physical or psychological suffering. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153,\n173, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); see also, e.g., Calhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir.2003).\nBecause he was not a convicted prisoner, Thompson cannot maintain an Eighth Amendment claim. But that does\nnot impair in the least his chances of success in this action. Detainees who have not been convicted of a crime\nare entitled to greater protection than convicted prisoners, not less. See, e.g., Hart v. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887, 891\n(7th Cir.2005); Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d 469, 477 (7th Cir.2005). Specifically, a pretrial detainee enjoys the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and may not be punished at all (except for\ninfractions committed while in custody). See, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861; Hart, 396 F.3d at 893; \nBoard, 394 F.3d at 477; Tesch v. County of Green Lake, 157 F.3d 465, 473 (7th Cir.1998). Thus if a particular\ncondition of pretrial detention amounts to punishment, it is unconstitutional.\nThompson was held in civil contempt; he was not convicted of any sort of a crime. Though he cannot complain\nthat his imprisonment for civil contempt was an act of punishment, see, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651,\n667-68, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977); Rodriguez v. Briley, 403 F.3d 952, 953 (7th Cir.2005), that does\nnot mean that he could be subjected to detention conditions that were punitive in nature. Thompson was\nincarcerated not to be punished, but so that he might be induced to comply with the state court judge's directive.\nThe Court sees no basis to assess his treatment by a more relaxed standard than one that applies to pretrial\ndetainees.\nGiven these considerations, if Thompson could show that the particular practices he challenges were punitive in\nnature, he would prevail. But although Thompson might be able to sustain an individual-capacity claim against\nthe individual who actually administered the urethral swabbing procedure to him00the self-described \"dick\n97\ndoctor\"00he has not made any claims against any of the defendants in their individual capacities. Looking at the\n97\n\npolicies he challenges in his official-capacity claims against the defendants, the Court sees no evidence that\nwould support a claim that the County's practices constituted punishment. To prove that a particular condition or\npractice was punitive, Thompson must establish both that the practice was objectively punitive and that the\nresponsible officials acted with a culpable mental state. See Tesch, 157 F.3d at 473. If a particular condition or\npractice is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to\npunishment; conversely, if the practice is arbitrary or purposeless, a court may infer that it is punitive. Id. at 474\n(citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct. 1861). Thompson has no evidence that the County acted with deliberate\nindifference, the mental state required to sustain a claim of improperly punitive conditions. See id. at 475 & n. 3\n888 (citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303, *888 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991)); see also, Board, 394\nF.3d at 478.\nIn Hart, the Seventh Circuit suggested that proof of a punitive purpose ought not be necessary to establish a\nclaim under the Due Process Clause that a particular condition of pretrial detention is punitive. Hart, 396 F.3d at\n891-92. It proposed a standard under which a gratuitously harsh or severe condition would be considered\npunitive even in the absence of proof of punitive intent. Id. at 892-93. Assuming that is the appropriate standard,\nThompson still fails to provide evidence from which one reasonably could infer that the practices he challenges\nwere punitive. There is no question that the urethral swab procedure produces pain or at least discomfort, as well\nas, perhaps, embarrassment and that the visual body cavity inspection is likewise intrusive and embarrassing.\nBut calling these practices gratuitously harsh or severe and therefore punitive is too big a stretch.\nThompson's case, however, does not rise or fall on the question of whether the procedures he challenges were\npunitive. He also challenges both the urethral swab testing and the body cavity inspection as violative of the\nFourth Amendment and also attacks the former procedure as contrary to his right under the Due Process Clause\nto refuse unwanted medical treatment. We turn next to those challenges.\n3. The visual body cavity search\nWe begin with the body cavity inspection. What is presented for the Court's review in this case is the propriety of\nblanket body cavity inspections of all incoming detainees at the jail, without reasonable suspicion that they might\nbe concealing contraband, and no matter what they are charged with00a felony of any type, a misdemeanor, or,\n97\nlike Thompson, civil contempt. The defendants make no claim, and offer no evidence, of any basis to believe that\nThompson could have been concealing contraband. Nor have they offered evidence that civil contemnors as a\ngroup are at all likely to be concealing contraband on their persons.\nBoth pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners00and thus, by analogy, civil contemnors00retain constitutional\n97 97\nrights, including the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Bell 441 U.S.\nat 545, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Those rights, however, are subject to limitations based on the fact of confinement, the\nlegitimate goals of the penal institution, and the institution's need to maintain security and order. Id. at 545-46, 99\nS.Ct. 1861. An institutional practice claimed to infringe a constitutional guarantee must be evaluated in light of the\ncentral objective of jail administration, that is, keeping the institution secure. Id. at 546, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Courts\nmust make this evaluation deferentially, giving due regard to the professional expertise of correctional officials. Id.\nat 548, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court considered the propriety of body cavity searches of pretrial detainees as well as\nconvicted prisoners under a Fourth Amendment standard, though it appeared to assume, rather than decide, that\nthis was the proper standard. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Several years after the Supreme Court decided Bell, it\nheld that a prison inmate lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in his prison cell and thus cannot sustain a\nFourth Amendment claim regarding a search of his cell. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82\nL.Ed.2d 393 (1984). But Hudson did not disturb Bell's application of the Fourth Amendment to searches of a\ndetainee's or inmate's person, and courts have continued to apply the Fourth Amendment when assessing the\n889 propriety of strip searches and body cavity searches of arrestees, pretrial *889 detainees, and convicted\nprisoners. See, e.g., Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 28-30 (1st Cir.2003) (arrestee); Shain v. Ellison, 273\nF.3d 56, 63-64 (2d Cir.2001) (pretrial detainee); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2001)\n(arrestee); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir.2001) (pretrial detainee); Peckham v. Wisconsin\nDep't of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694, 697 (7th Cir.1998) (convicted prisoner); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't,\n901 F.2d 702, 712-13 (9th Cir.1989) (arrestee). Cf. Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1039 n. 5 (7th Cir.1994)\n\n(convicted prisoner; holding appellant had waived Fourth Amendment challenge, but citing other cases applying\nFourth Amendment).\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches, a standard \"not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. A court considers the scope of the intrusion, the\nmanner in which it was conducted, the justification for the intrusion, and the place where it was conducted. Id.\nIt is beyond argument that the search involved is extremely intrusive. As the Seventh Circuit stated in a case\ninvolving misdemeanor arrestees, \"we can think of few exercises of authority by the state that intrude on the\ncitizen's privacy and dignity as severely as the visual and anal genital searches practiced here.\" Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983). And rather than being conducted in private00as was the case\n97\nin Mary Beth G.00Thompson was searched in full view of dozens of other detainees, not to mention a significant\n97\nnumber of jail guards.\nThe real issue in this case, however, concerns the justification for the visual cavity search. The defendants\ncontend that the routine visual cavity search is required to prevent inmates from smuggling\ncontraband00weapons, drugs, and so on00into the jail. Maintaining institutional security is \"perhaps the most\n97 97\nlegitimate of penological goals.\" Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 133, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003)\n. As we have indicated, the determinations of correctional officials in this regard are entitled to deference, absent\nevidence they have overreacted to concerns inherent in the prison or jail context. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 540, 99\nS.Ct. 1861; see also, Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 966 (7th Cir.2003). But this does not immunize jail\nofficials' decisions from scrutiny. Stanley, 337 F.3d at 966. Officials do not have carte blanche to institute any\npolicy they please under the justification of institutional security. \"An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\napplied . . . [cannot] be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security\nconsiderations.\" Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113 (ellipsis in original; quoting Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th\nCir.1981)).\nAs Thompson argues, defendants have failed to provide any evidence supporting the need to conduct body\ncavity searches on all new detainees, much less on those like Thompson imprisoned for civil contempt. The only\nevidence offered by defendants consists of the following unexplained statement by superintendent Brown at his\ndeposition:\nWe have, yes, in the jail, where detainees have hidden homemade knives, I can't think of a\nspecific instance where I could go back and00you know, but I do know that personally being the\n97\ncase, that that has00when they try to00detainees will try to smuggle things in. A lighter, for instance,\n97 97\nwhich could be considered a weapon, definitely I've seen that in the receiving room. I've seen00\n97\nyou know, you asked about weapons.\n890 Brown Dep. at 20-21. As Thompson suggests, it is unclear whether this testimony *890 concerns items found on\nnewly-arriving detainees, as opposed to detainees who were already at the jail. Without more, this evidence00the\n97\nonly evidence defendants point to as justifying their blanket cavity search policy00is insufficient to entitle them to\n97\nsummary judgment.\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court upheld a detention facility's policy of conducting a strip search, including a visual\ninspection of body cavities, of both sentenced prisoners and pretrial detainees, after every contact visit with a\nperson from outside the institution. Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861. But unlike the inmates in Bell,\nThompson and the other detainees in this case were not being searched following contact with outsiders. Rather,\nthey were subject to an \"intake\" search following their arrest by law enforcement officials. \"Unlike persons already\nin jail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and\nthus an opportunity to hide something.\" Shain, 273 F.3d at 63. And it is a relatively safe assumption00at least in\n97\nthe absence of evidence to the contrary00that only a negligible portion of arrestees have concealed contraband in\n97\nbody cavities prior to their encounter with law enforcement.\nDefendants have cited no cases that per se validate blanket strip searches for non-felony detainees in detention\ncenters. In fact, courts have generally held that persons detained for minor offenses not involving weapons or\ndrugs may not be subjected to a strip search or visual cavity search absent reasonable suspicion that the\n\nparticular arrestee or detainee is concealing such items. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112; Shain, 273 F.3d at 62-66; \nWilson, 251 F.3d at 1343; Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2000); Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819,\n821-22 (5th Cir. 1996); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1997); Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 712-13; Weber v.\nDell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1985); Giles v.\nAckerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir.1984); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. In Roberts, the First Circuit\nindicated that searching all inmates is more reasonable in cases in which the record reflects a history of problems\nwith prisoners smuggling items into the institution. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112. But as indicated earlier, the\ndefendants have offered only scant evidence that Cook County Jail has such a history00certainly insufficient\n97\nevidence to entitle them to summary judgment. In short, genuine issues of material fact exist precluding entry of\nsummary judgment on Thompson's claim regarding the visual body cavity search.\n4. The urethral swabbing\nWe deal next with the urethral swab test. The first question is what provision of the Constitution supplies the\nstandard by which the Court assesses the propriety of the test. Thompson relies on the Fourth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments, but as the Court has already ruled, the Eighth Amendment does not apply.\nIn Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 768-72, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), the Court used the\nFourth Amendment to determine the propriety of imposing an invasive medical procedure on an arrestee00in that\n97\ncase, the drawing of blood. Similarly, in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 616, 109 S.Ct.\n1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989), the Court concluded that a compelled drawing and testing of blood, administration\nof a Breathalyzer test, \"which generally requires the production of alveolar or `deep lung' breath,\" and collection\nand testing of urine, each constituted a search subject to the Fourth Amendment. These cases indicate that the\n891 administration of the urethral *891 swabbing is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment.\nConsent may justify a search under the Fourth Amendment, so long as it is \"freely and voluntarily given.\" \nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); see also, e.g., United\nStates v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 423, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976). The defendants argue that Thompson\nconsented to the search by signing the medical intake form. As noted earlier, Thompson denies signing the form.\nBut even if Thompson had admitted signing the form, the defendants would not be entitled to summary judgment\non this point. The consent form merely advises that the detainee will be screened for sexually transmitted\ndiseases. It says nothing about the testing procedures or bodily intrusions involved. It is difficult to see how a\nform that does not even mention that a search will occur can be deemed to constitute consent for a search. The\ndefendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this ground.\nUnder the Fourth Amendment, the permissibility of a search \"is judged by balancing its intrusion on the\nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" Skinner, 489\nU.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660\n(1979)). In the context of a criminal case or a search for evidence, the balance generally tilts in favor of the\nprocedures described in the Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause. Id. But searches that, like this one, are\nconducted for purposes other than to gather evidence are analyzed under the so-called \"special needs\" standard.\nId. (citing cases). Under this standard, effectively the same one articulated in Bell, courts consider the nature of\nthe privacy interest at stake, the character of the intrusion, and the nature of the government's interest and the\nefficacy of its practice in meeting that interest. See, e.g., Bd. of Educ. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 92 v. Earls, 536\nU.S. 822, 830-32, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735 (2002).\nThe parties also seem to agree that the urethral swab test should be analyzed under the standards that apply to\nadministration of unwanted medical procedures. Indeed, the defendants seek to justify the test on the ground that\nit advances the institution's interest in protecting the health of inmates. An inmate has an interest, protected by\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in refusing unwanted medical treatment. See Cruzan v.\nDirector, Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278-79, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); Washington v.\n[3]\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-22, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990).  A regulation that impinges on this\ninterest is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. Russell v. Richards, 384 F.3d 444,\n447 (7th Cir.2004) (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). The factors to\nbe considered include whether there is a valid and rational connection between the regulation and the\n\ngovernmental interest put forward to justify it; the impact that accommodation of the inmate's right would have on\nguards, other inmates, and jail resources; and whether there is a ready alternative that would fully accommodate\nthe prisoner's right to refuse treatment at a minimal cost to valid penological interests. Id. at 447-49.\n892 *892 Though the Fourth Amendment and due process standards are not identical, there is sufficient overlap to\npermit the Court to discuss the relevant factors together.\nFirst of all, for Fourth Amendment purposes, the privacy interest at stake is significant, and the intrusion involved\ncannot fairly be described as minimal. In Skinner, the Court, though noting that the collection of urine was not an\ninvasive procedure, expressed reluctance to \"characterize . . . as minimal\" the privacy concerns arising from the\nintimacy of the bodily function involved in the intrusion, and relied on the existence of regulations that \"endeavor\n[ed] to reduce the intrusiveness of the collection process,\" including the absence of observation and conduct of\nthe procedure in a medical environment by independent personnel. Skinner, 489 U.S. at 626, 109 S.Ct. 1402.\nThe urethral swabbing procedure, by contrast, involves invasion of one of the most intimate and sensitive parts of\nthe male body, and the evidence submitted by the parties suggests that the procedures used may exacerbate,\nrather than reduce, the procedure's inherent intrusiveness. As a result, the Court can only conclude that the\nintrusion involved is a significant one that is not mitigated by the processes adopted by the defendants.\nAssessment of the governmental interest involved and the \"fit\" between that interest and the procedure at issue is\nan aspect of both the Fourth Amendment and due process standards. Though the due process standard requires\na rational fit, as opposed to a perfect fit, between Cook County's legitimate interests and the policy in question,\nthere must still exist a logical connection between the urethral swabbing and the interests defendants offer as\njustification. See Russell, 384 F.3d at 448.\nThe defendants claim that their STD testing is conducted \"for purposes of promoting health of inmates even after\nthey are discharged from the Cook County Department of Corrections.\" Defs' 56.1 Stmt. ยถ 16. They also contend\nthat \"Cermak Health Services is concerned about the maintenance and improvement of the health of its inmate\npopulation, especially since the medical screening is in some instances the only medical care many inmates have\nreceived.\" Id. at ยถ 49. Noticeably absent from this seemingly benevolent purpose is any indication that the\ndefendants developed this policy to eradicate an existing problem with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in\nthe Cook County Jail.\nThe defendants cite national studies affirming that STDs continue to be a major health threat in the United States\nand provide evidence that \"multiple studies and surveillance projects have demonstrated a high prevalence of\nSTDs in persons entering jails and correctional facilities.\" Raba Aff. ยถ 15. But they have provided no evidence that\nthe Cook County Jail has experienced similar problems. Jean Kiriazes, the director of continuous quality\nimprovement and risk management at Cermak Health Services, who says she is the person in the best position\nto answer questions related to the intake policies, see Kiriazes Dep. at 5, was unaware of venereal diseases\nhaving ever been spread in the Cook County Jail. Id. at 29. Similarly, jail superintendent Brown testified that he is\nunaware of any sexually transmitted disease having been spread in the facility and that nobody has ever\nexpressed a concern to him along these lines. Brown Dep. at 37-38.\nPerhaps more importantly, the defendants have provided no evidence that their program is geared toward\ncurbing the spread of STDs or eliminating such infections in inmates. The laboratory reports do not differentiate\n893 among inmates who *893 test negative and those who refused to consent to the urethral swabbing00a distinction\n97\nthat would seem important if the goal were to prevent the spread of STDs in the jail. See Wicheanvonagoon Aft ยถ\n9. The defendants have also provided no description of the course of action they take if a prisoner tests positive\nfor an STD, such as segregating that prisoner from non-infected inmates until he is treated. The defendants' key\npersonnel do not even seem to know how long it takes to obtain results from the urethral swabbing and whether\nresults are obtained during the relatively short average stay of a detainee (according to Kiriazes, between\nfourteen and twenty-one days). See Kiriazes Dep. at 29; Brown Dep. at 44. In addition, superintendent Brown\nwas unaware of any inmate who has ever been treated for a venereal disease based on the results of the\nscreening. Brown Dep. at 88. On the present record, the connection between the defendants' justifications and\nthe challenged policy is too tenuous to entitle the defendants to summary judgment.\n\nFurthermore, this case concerns an invasive and uncomfortable procedure that is carried out not in a private\nsetting, but rather under the watchful eyes of at least one other detainee who has a view from the open doorway.\nEven considering the jail setting, this is a significant intrusion on privacy. And there may be an available\nalternative that would be far less invasive and might actually reduce the jail's expenses. Dr. Raba testified that\nthe estimated cost of a urine collection technique is the same or slightly less than the cost of the urethral\nswabbing. Id. He opined, however, that urine screening would be logistically unfeasible in the intake facility as it\nnow exists00only one toilet is allegedly available00and that some inmates might, due to anxiety, be unable to\n97 97\nproduce a sample. The record as it now stands does not permit the Court to assess adequately the effectiveness\nof an alternative procedure.\nFinally, as part of the due process analysis, the Court considers the effect that barring unconsented urethral\nswabbing would have on other prisoners and the staff. There is no question that a jail has a duty to ensure the\nsafety and well-being of its inmates and staff. See Russell, 384 F.3d at 448. But as indicated earlier, the\ndefendants have provided no evidence that it uses the policy to carry out that duty. On the present record, one\ncannot find that prisoners or jail staff would be detrimentally affected if this procedure were eliminated. Cf. id. at\n448-49 (\"The fact that the jail has endured a number of lice outbreaks in the past demonstrates that this is more\nthan an abstract possibility.\"). Moreover, the jail stopped conducting urethral swabbing tests during intake in May\n2003 \"due to reprioritization of the medical intake process.\" Def's 56.1 Stmt. ยถ 42. This arguably suggests that the\nCounty itself attached little importance to its use of this procedure.\nIn sum, there are genuine factual issues regarding whether the urethral swabbing policy violated Thompson's\nFourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, thus precluding entry of summary judgment.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court denies defendants' motion for summary judgment [docket no. 34]. The\ncase is set for a status hearing on August 16, 2005 at 9:30 a.m. for the purpose of setting a trial date and\ndiscussing the possibility of settlement.\n[1] Thompson denies that Kinnerk conducted the interview. He says the person who interviewed him was African-\nAmerican. Kinnerk is Caucasian.\n[2] The parties disagree on the relevant terminology. Defendants maintain that inmates are strip searched as part\nof intake procedure, but that they do not receive a cavity search, which defendants say involves touching. Courts,\nhowever, distinguish between visual cavity searches, which involve visually inspecting body cavities, and the\nmore invasive procedure, sometimes referred to as a digital cavity search, that involves touching or physically\nsearching an individual's body cavities. See Thompson v. Souza, Ill F.3d 694, 700-701 (9th Cir.1997); see also \nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1274 (7th Cir.1983) (referring to similar procedure as \"visual\ncavity search\"). As the parties agree that no touching was involved, we will refer to the intake procedure as a\nvisual cavity search.\n[3]Cruzan and Harper involved convicted prisoners, but pretrial detainees00and thus presumably civil\n97\ncontemnors00have at least tho rights guaranteed to convicted prisoners. See Russell v. Richards, 384 F.3d 444,\n97\n447 n. 1 (7th Cir.2004) (citing Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992)).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This action arises under Section 1983 and Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act, \n42 U.S.C. ยงยง1983, 1988.  Plaintiff is an attorney who on October 8, 2002 was required by a \njudge of the Circuit Court of Cook County to sign a document waivmg and relmquishing his \nrights to valuable marital assets m Plaintiff's dissolution proceeding.  Plaintiff refused to sign the \ndocument m order to avoid committing perjury.

As a result ofhis refusal to sign the \n\ndocument, and regardless of his defense upon an effort to avoid committing peIjury, PJaintiffwas \nincarcerated upon a finding of contempt in the Cook County Department of Corrections on \nOctober 9,2002.  On that date, an agent of the Cook County Department of Corrections placed a \nrod in Plaintiff's urethra. Plaintiff was forced to provide blood.  And, Plaintiffwas subjected to a \nfull body cavity search. \n2.  The actions of the Defendants violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights to be free \nof unreasonable searches, to enjoy due process, and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. \nPlaintiff seeks declaratory, injunctive, compensatory, and other relief to remedy the Defendants' \nunconstitutional policies. \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n3.  Plaintiff is a patent attorney who is currently registered in Arizona, Georgia and \nIllinois.  As of October 9,2002 Plaintiffhad passed the Illinois Bar exam and was awaiting his \nadmission to the Illinois Bar. \n4.  Plaintiff is the respondent in a  dissolution of marriage proceeding before The \nHonorable Judge William Stewart Boyd of the Cook County Circuit Court (filed in October \n2001). \n5.  On October 8, 2002, Plaintiffwas ordered to sign a waiver.  The waiver required \nPlaintiff to  provide  sworn testimony  that  he  was  not  signing  the  waiver  under  coercion. \nCoercion was present in that Plaintiff was under threat of incarceration if he failed to sign the \nwaiver. \n6.  On October 9, 2002, upon his refusal to sign the waiver, officers acting under the \nauthority of defendant Michael Sheahan, as Sheriff of Cook County, arrested Plaintiff. \n7.  On October 9, 2002, Plaintiff was transported to the Cook County Department of \nCorrections facility at approximately 26th and California. \n8.  On October 9, 2002, Plaintiff was forced to submit to intake procedures at the \nCook County Department of Corrections facility at approximately 26th and California. \n9.  Pursuant to policies  imposed  by Defendants,  arrestees processed through the \nCook  County  Department  of Corrections  intake  area  receive  medical  and  menta!  health \nscreening.  During  intake,  defendant  County  of Cook,  acting  through  the  Cook  County \nDepartment of Corrections, the Cook County Department of Public Health, and Cermak Health \n2 \n\nServices of Cook County, collect medical samples purportedly for the purpose of syphilis and \ngonorrhea testing.  Upon  information  and  belief;  intake  procedures  at  the  Department  of \nCorrections include urine-based gonorrhea and chlamydia testing for women arrestees.  The \nintake procedures are drastically different for male arrestees. \n10.  On October 9, 2002, an agent of the Defendants placed a metal rod into Plaintiff's \nurethra.  Derendants' actions caused Plaintiff to suffer great pain, humiliation and emotional \ndistress.  The agent who placed the metal rod into Plaintiff's urethra introduced himself to the \nhalf-naked arrestees by telling them to remain in line against the wall, to remain silent, and to \nrefrain from taking any other actions because \"you don't want to piss-off the Dick Doctor\" and \nyou don't want to \"fuck with the Dick Doctor.\"  While smoking a cigarette, the self-described \n\"Dick Doctor\" selected one arrestee for special treatment.  Through verbal abuse, that arrestee \nwas individually informed that he would be making a huge mistake ifhe were to anger the \"Dick \nDoctor.\" \n11.  After Plaintiff passed through a door, the \"Dick Doctor\" ordered Plaintiff to \nexpose his penis and to hold his penis so that it was hanging over a large plastic waste container. \nThe \"Dick Doctor\" then inserted a metal rod into Plaintiff's urethra.  Plaintiff was then forced to \nprovide blood.  Plaintiff was then subjected to a full-body cavity search. \n12.  On October 11, 2002 Plaintiff was again brought before Judge Boyd.  Plaintiff \nagain refused to sign the waiver. Plaintiffwas then released from incarcemtion. \nJURISDICTION \n13.

Plaintiff is a citizen of the United States of America and is a resident of Cook \nCounty Illinois.  Plaintiff has resided at 111760 Brook Hill Drive at all relevant times but for the \ntime he was incarcerated in the Cook County Department of Corrections. \nCount I - The Strip Search - Fourth Amendment \n22.  Plaintiff was subjected to a strip search.  Plaintiff saw no attempt to segregate \ncertain persons who would be subject to strip searches from those who would not be subject to \nstrip searches.  Searches ofp retrial detainees in jail must be reasonable within the meaning of the \nFourth Amendment.  To evaluate the reasonableness of a challenged search, the court or jury \nmust balance the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.  The  county may have a  weighty interest  in preventing the introduction of \nweapons or other contraband into the jail However, a strip search, particularly a full body cavity \nsearch as practiced by defendants, are demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified and humiliating. \n23.  Policies calling for blanket strip searches are invalid.  Strip searches generally \nrequire individualized suspicion that an arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.  Placement \nin a general prison population cannot alone justifY a strip search.  An offense must be sufficiently \nassociated with violence to justify a visual strip search. \n24.  Plaintiff was arrested fur civil contempt for an alleged improper refusal to provide \nhis  signature on a  document.  The county had  no  reasonable  individualized  suspicion that \nPlaintiff was carrying or concealing contraband.  The offense for which Plaintiff was subject to \narrest was not associated in any way with violence. \n5 \n\n25.  Upon information and beliet; the full body cavity search is an official county \npolicy or custom of subjecting non-violent contempt arrestees to unconstitutional strip searches. \nThe information and belief including that Plaintiff did not observe any efforts to segregate those \nwho would be subject to a full-cavity search from those who would be subject to a less invasive \nsearch and  the  fact  that Plaintiff was subject to a  full cavity search though he was not a \nincarcerated based upon any allegations related to violence. \n26.  The defendants  medical procedures  are  also  practiced  in  an unconstitutional \nmanner.  Any claim that the county's medical  screening policy  is justified based upon the \ncounties  interest  in diagnosing  severe  medical problems to  prevent transmission of serious \ndisease among the general jail population must fail in light of the county's failure to test for the \nmv \nvirus which poses a far greater risk to the prison population and could be,  but is not, \nscreened for using the same invasive procedures that are already employed.  Upon information \nand beliet; the insertion of a metal rod into the urethra is of male prisons is an official county \npolicy or custom.  Searches that in theory might be constitutional, run afoul of the Fourth \nAmendment ifc onducted in an unnecessarily cruel, painful or dangerous manner. \n27.  Defendants  have  violated  Plaintiff's  rights  under  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, as enforced through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Plaintiff \nwas subject to unconstitutional prison procedures and conditions. \nCount II -The Deprivation of Liberty without Due Process - Fourteenth Amendments \n28.  Defendants subjected Plaintiff to incarceration and physical harm.  Defendants' \nactions  caused  Plaintiff the  loss  of his  liberty  interest  including  his  interfering  with  his \nemployment opportunities,  his interest  in remaining  free  of unlawful  searches,  and free  of \nexcessive force, and free of unlawful invasions of his privacy.  Defendants deprived Plaintiff of \nhis due process right to be free of unjustified intrusions into his body.  Plaintiff's due process \nright  includes the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment and the right to  information \nsufficient to exercise an intelligent choice.  Retaliation for the exercise of the right to refuse \ntreatment is itself a violation of Plaintiff's rights. \n6 \n\nm -\nCount  The Cruel and Unusual Punishment - Fourteenth Amendment \n29.  Defendants intentionally inflicted upon Plaintiff needless suffering.  Defendants \ndeliberately gave him a kind of medical treatment knowing that it was  more invasive than \nnecessary.  The conditions under which Plaintiff was confined pose a substantial risk of serious \nharm and defendants were acting with a deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of serious \nharm to Plaintiff. \n30.  The Department of Corrections screening procedure is a custom or policy and has \nbeen described as \"universal gonorrhea testiog.\"  The reasonableness of Defendants' actions \nmust  also  take  into  consideration  that  the  U.S.  Department  of Justice  indicates  that  few \ncorrectional systems routinely screen inmates for STDs.  It is very rare for correctional facilities \nto incorporate routine urethral swabbing screening for gonorrhea.  It is possible to perfurm urine \ngonorrhea screening - as is used fur women detainees.  In the absence of such screening in the \nvast majority of correctional institutions the states interest in performiog urethral swabbing must \nbe considered slight. \n31.  Upon information and belief, including that lDV is not tested for despite the \nextremely invasive screening procedures and the self-proclaimed Dick Doctor's warning that he \nshould not be \"fucked\" with, defendants deliberately provide overly invasive and less efficacious \nscreening procedures in order to intimidate arrestees rather that for permissible purposes. \n32.  The presence and actions of the self-described \"Dick Doctor\" indicate the actions \nof placing a rod into the urethra of male prisoners is done with an intent to punish pretrial \ndetainees.  The Defendants' policies and practices violate Plaintiff's rights under the Eight and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as enforced through 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. \nCount IV - Assault \n33.  The defendants and their agents intentionally created a reasonable apprehension in \nPlaintiff of immediate harmful or offensive contact to Plaintiff's person.  Defendants' actions \ncaused injury to Plaintiff. \nCount V - Battery \n34.  The defendants intentionally and without legal justification caused a harmful and \noffensive contact with Plaintiff's person.  The defendants' actions caused injury to Plaintiff.  The \n7 \nโข \n\ndefendants committed an act of sexual penetration by the use of threat of force.  The defendants \ncommitted an act of sexual penetration and the defendants knew that Plaintiff was unable to give \nknowing consent. \nCount VI - Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n35.  The defendants' conduct was extreme and outrageous.  The defendants intended \ntheir conduct inflict severe emotional distress, or knew there was at least a high probability that \ntheir conduct would cause severe emotional distress and were reckless as to the effect of their \nconduct.  The defendants caused Plaintiff severe emotional distress. \nWHEREFORE,  the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable  Court enter  a \njudgment against the Defendants as  well as the  Unknown Officers and the  ''Dick Doctor\" \nproviding as follows: \nA  Declare the  acts  and omissions of the Defendants violates the Fourth,  Fifth, \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \nB.  Enjoining the Defendants, as well as their officers, from conducting strip searches \nwithout warrant and without probable cause; \nC.  Enjoining the  Defendants,  as  well  as  their  officers,  from  urethral  swabbing \nwithout full and informed consent; \nD.  Mandatorily  imposing  upon  the  Defendants  training,  education  and  other \nrequirements with the goal of enhancing the knowledge of discrimination matters \nand relations  and  enhancing  the  skills  of officers  within  Cook  County  law \nenforcement relating to prisoner rights and handling; \nE.  Compensatory damages,  paid to Plaintiff,  by the Defendants in a  reasonable \namount which the trier of fact deems sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for his \ninjuries; \nF.  Punitive damages paid to Plaintiff by Defendants in a reasonable amount which \nthe trier of fact deems sufficient to deter future illegal conduct; and \nG.  Payment by the Defendants of Plaintiffs attorneys' fees, witness fees and costs of \nthis action, in an amount to be set forth in an affidavit from the attorney(s) for \nPlaintiff at the conclusion of this matter. \n8 \n\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITIED this ~day of March 2004. \nV \nLawrence E.

      "text": "428 F.Supp.2d 807 (2006)\nLawrence THOMPSON, Plaintiff,\nv.\nThe COUNTY OF COOK and Michael Sheahan, Sheriff of Cook County, in his official\ncapacity, Defendants.\nNo. 03 C 7172.\nUnited States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Eastern Division.\nApril 18, 2006.\n808 *808 John P. Derose, Jessica Rae Hill, John P. Derose and Associates, Burr Ridge, IL, for Plaintiff.\nFrancis J. Catania, Donald J. Pechous, John A. Ouska, Chicago, IL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nKENNELLY, District Judge.\nPlaintiff Lawrence Thompson sued Cook County and Sheriff Michael Sheahan for allegedly violating his\nconstitutional rights while he was incarcerated in the Cook County Jail for civil contempt. He claims that jail\nofficials subjected him to an unreasonable strip search in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights (Count 1) and\nperformed an invasive urethral swabbing procedure without his consent in violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights (Counts 2 and 3). On February 7, 2006, a jury found in favor of the defendants on all counts.\nThompson has moved for a new trial. For the following reasons, the Court orders a new trial on Count 1 but\notherwise denies Thompson's motion.\nFacts\nOn October 9, 2002, a judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County found Thompson in civil contempt and ordered\nhim held in custody after Thompson refused to sign certain documents related to his pending divorce\nproceedings. Cook County Sheriff s deputies took Thompson into custody and transported him to the Cook\nCounty Jail along with other individuals, some of whom were already wearing jail-issued clothing.\nUpon arrival at the jail, Thompson was processed along with approximately 250 other new inmates. After\nspending some time in a holding pen, Thompson and the others were photographed and given identification\ncards. An employee from Cermak Health Services, the agency responsible for administering medical treatment to\ndetainees at the Cook County Jail, then asked Thompson a number of medical screening questions. During the\ninterview, Thompson responded to questions on a standard form concerning his medical history and signed the\nfollowing \"consent for treatment\" portion of the form:\nI consent to a medical and mental health history and physical including screening for tuberculosis\nand sexually transmitted diseases as part of the intake process of the Cook County Jail. I also\nconsent to ongoing medical treatment by Cermak Health Services staff for problems identified\nduring this process. I understand I may be asked to sign forms allowing other medical treatments.\nI understand that every effort will be made by CHS staff to keep my medical problems confidential.\nI understand the policy of CHS regarding access to health care at Cook County Jail.\nAt trial, the defendants presented evidence that during the interview, a Cook County Jail employee informed\nThompson of his right to refuse the medical screening. Thompson denied that anyone informed him of his right to\nrefuse consent.\n\nFollowing the medical screening interview, Thompson's personal property was inventoried. He and other inmates\nthen underwent a urethral swabbing procedure. Thompson testified that a man who referred to himself as the\n\"dick doctor\" addressed the group, making various threats, such as \"you don't want to piss-off the dick doctor.\"\n809 The inmates went into a room, one at a time, to undergo the procedure. *809 Thompson testified that when it was\nhis turn, the individual performing the procedure directed him to take out his penis and hang it over a garbage\ncan and then inserted into Thompson's urethra a metal rod with a swab on the end. Thompson claims that he felt\npain both during and after the procedure.\nThe defendants conceded that in 2002, it was the policy of Cermak Health Services, in conjunction with the Cook\nCounty Department of Health and the City of Chicago Department of Health, to conduct urethral swabbing on\nmale detainees entering Cook County Jail to screen for syphilis and chlamydia. The defendants aver that this\njoint project was developed for purposes of promoting the health of inmates. Melvin Judkins, a paramedic who\nhas worked for Cermak Health Services for seventeen years, testified that the test involves inserting a thin swab\na short distance into the urethra and gently rotating it to collect any organisms or inflammatory cells.\nAfter the urethral swabbing procedure, Department of Corrections officers escorted Thompson and other inmates\ninto a receiving tunnel in groups of forty to fifty at a time. The officers lined them up on both sides of the hallway\nand ordered them to take off their clothes and place them on the ground in front of them. The officers then\ninstructed Thompson and the others to face the wall, run their fingers through their hair, and then bend or squat\nand cough. After ordering the inmates to hold up each item of clothing for inspection, the officers allowed them to\nget dressed.\nDuring closing argument, Thompson's attorney contended that the strip search violated the Fourth Amendment's\nprohibition against unreasonable searches. He also maintained that because Thompson did not consent to the\nurethral swabbing, the defendants violated Thompson's Fourth Amendment and due process rights to be free\nfrom unjustified intrusions into his body and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. In response, the defendants'\nattorney argued that Thompson knew what he was doing when he signed the medical consent form and that the\nstrip search was reasonable because defendants reasonably suspected that Thompson was concealing\ncontraband on his person.\nAfter a four day trial, the jury returned a verdict in the defendants' favor on all counts.\nDiscussion\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) permits a court to grant a motion for a new trial if the jury's verdict was\nagainst the clear weight of the evidence or the trial was unfair to the moving party. Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.,\n979 F.2d 1187, 1196 (7th Cir.1992). Thompson makes three principal arguments in support of his motion for a\nnew trial: a Cook County employee was erroneously allowed to remain on the jury; the defendants' attorney\nimproperly and inaccurately referred to Thompson as a \"rich lawyer\" during closing argument; and the clear\nweight of the evidence indicated that jail officers lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the strip search.\n1. Failure to excuse juror for cause\nAt trial, one of the prospective jurors was a medical doctor who chairs the neuroanesthesiology department at\nStroger Hospital, which is managed by the Cook County Bureau of Health Services, the same administrative\nagency that manages Cermak Health Services. Thompson challenged this juror for cause, arguing that a Cook\nCounty employee responsible for administering medical treatment would unfairly favor the defendants. The Court\n810 overruled Thompson's challenge after the juror insisted that he could be impartial, *810 and the juror was seated\nafter Thompson declined to use a peremptory challenge to remove him. This juror was eventually elected the\njury's foreperson. Thompson argues that he was denied a fair trial because the Court allowed the juror to remain\non the jury.\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that district courts should excuse certain jurors who have a particularly close\nrelationship to the litigants. See United States v. Polichemi, 219 F.3d 698, 704 (7th Cir.2000) (\"A court must\nexcuse a juror for cause if the juror is related to one of the parties in the case[ ] or if the juror has even a tiny\n\nfinancial interest in the case.\"). Id. Though such a juror may be objective in fact, the law errs on the side of\ncaution and requires the juror's dismissal. Id. In Polichemi, the district court declined to disqualify a juror who was\nemployed by the same United States Attorney's office that was prosecuting the, case before the court. Id. at 705.\nThe court of appeals said that it agreed with the United States that \"government employment alone is not, and\nshould not be, enough to trigger the [common law] rule under which an employee is disqualified from serving as a\njuror in a case involving her employer.\" Id. at 704. The court concluded, however, that an employee of the same\nprosecutor's office was too closely related to the lawsuit and should have been struck for cause. Id. at 705.\nThe Seventh Circuit has not directly considered00so far as the Court can ascertain00whether employees are\n97 97\nprohibited from serving on juries involving their employers, notwithstanding the common law's contrary rule. The\nNinth Circuit, however, has held that it is not an abuse of discretion to allow such an employee to serve. See \nNathan v. Boeing Co., 116 F.3d 422, 425 (9th Cir.1997). In Nathan, two potential jurors were employees of the\ndefendant corporation, but nothing else in the record indicated that they could not render impartial verdicts. The\ncourt said there was no per se rule prohibiting an employee of a party from serving on a jury and held that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the jurors to serve.\nAs noted earlier, the juror at issue in the present case is an employee and department chair of Stroger Hospital.\nStroger Hospital and Cermak Health Services, the agency whose employees performed the urethral swabbing\nprocedure on Thompson, are both part of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services, a government agency that\nemploys thousands of individuals. The juror stated during voir dire that he had administered anesthesia to jail\ninmates in the past, and he is casual friends with Ruth Rothstein, the director of the Cook County Department of\nPublic Health, and Callie Baird, the Director of the Cook County Department of Corrections. Both Rothstein and\nBaird were originally parties to the lawsuit but were no longer parties at the time of trial.\nThough the question is a close one, the Court concludes that it did not err by refusing to strike the juror for cause.\nThe Seventh Circuit's comments in Polichemi suggest that it would not disapprove of a government employee\nsitting on a jury involving his or her employer. Indeed, unlike the juror who was an employee of the United States\nAttorney's office, the juror in this case did not work with any of the witnesses or attorneys involved in the trial.\nRather, the relationship of the juror to the defendants in this case is no closer than the relationship at issue in \nNathan, where the prospective jurors were employees of a large corporate defendant. Our juror is also casual\nfriends with Baird and Rothstein, but neither of them were parties or witnesses in the lawsuit, and for that reason,\n811 the relationship does not suggest *811 potential bias. See United States v. Beasley, 48 F.3d 262, 267 (7th\nCir.1995) (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing juror, whose brother was Madison chief\nof police, to serve in case involving crime that occurred in Madison). For these reasons, the Court concludes that\nin light of the juror's insistence, upon careful questioning, that he could remain impartial, his relationship with the\ndefendants alone was not enough to indicate bias.\nThe two cases cited by Thompson on this issue do not support his argument. In Crawford v. United States, 212\nU.S. 183, 197, 29 S.Ct. 260, 53 L.Ed. 465 (1909), the Court held that a United States Post Office employee could\nnot sit as a juror in a prosecution of an individual charged with conspiracy to defraud the post office, but that case\nwas overruled by statute in 1935. See United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 132, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78\n(1936). In Vasey v. Martin Marietta Corp., 29 F.3d 1460, 1468 (10th Cir.1994), a potential juror's employer had a\nconsulting contract with the defendant, and the juror had interviewed and hired a number of the defendant's\nformer employees. Id. The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the juror to\nserve. Vasey, like Nathan, actually supports defendants' contention that an employee of one of the parties may\nserve on the jury.\n2. Defendants' closing argument\nThompson next argues that he did not receive a fair trial because the defendants' attorney made improper\ncomments during his closing argument. Specifically, Thompson claims it was improper for defendants' attorney to\nrefer to Thompson as a \"rich lawyer\" when the defendants' attorney had copies of Thompson's tax returns (which\nindicated that he was not rich) and attended the foreclosure hearing involving Thompson's home. Thompson also\nclaims it was improper for the defendants' attorney to suggest that Thompson had changed his appearance to\nprevent witnesses from recognizing him.\n\nThese isolated comments were not enough to render the trial unfair. The Court instructed the jury more than once\nthat closing arguments are not evidence and that the jury's verdict should be based on the evidence alone. Given\nthis instruction, coupled with the insignificant nature of the comments in the context of the closing arguments, the\nCourt is confident that the jury considered only evidence that was presented at trial. See Ramsey v. American Air\nFilter, Co., Inc., 772 F.2d 1303, 1311 (7th Cir.1985) (\"[A] party's improper comments during closing arguments\nrarely rise to the level of reversible error.\")\nThe cases that Thompson cites do not demand a different result. In Joseph v. Brierton, 739 F.2d 1244, 1247 (7th\nCir. 1984), defense counsel inappropriately took advantage of a ruling barring plaintiff's counsel from mentioning\nthat the defendants would be indemnified if found liable by extensively arguing that a judgment would financially\nruin his clients. Joseph does not control the outcome of this case, because there was no in limine ruling\npreventing defendants from discussing Thompson's wealth, and the \"rich lawyer\" comment was far more isolated\nthan the comments at issue in Joseph. Cases recognizing the impropriety of remarks concerning the relative\nwealth of the parties also do not control this case. See Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d 352, 364 (3d Cir.1999)\n; Adams Labs., Inc. v. Jacobs Eng'g, 761 F.2d 1218, 1226 (7th Cir.1985). Defendants' counsel made no such\nremarks during closing argument.\nThompson also maintains that the defendants' attorney's comments concerning Thompson's changed\n812 appearance violated *812 the rule against referring to missing witnesses. \"That rule permits an inference of\nunfavorable testimony from the missing witness, but only if that witness is peculiarly within the opposing party's\npower to produce.\" Littlefield v. McGuffey, 954 F.2d 1337, 1346 (7th Cir.1992). Thompson did not object to\nevidence concerning his changed appearance, and though the argument might have sought an unsupported\ninferential leap, the comments were insignificant, even when considered together with the comment describing\nThompson as a \"rich lawyer.\"\n3. Weight of evidence on strip search claim\nFinally, Thompson argues that the jury's verdict on Count 1, in which he alleged that the defendants subjected\nhim to an unreasonable body cavity search, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. A court considering\na motion for new trial may not set aside the jury's verdict \"if a reasonable basis exists in the record to support the\nverdict, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and leaving issues of credibility\nand weight of the evidence to the jury.\" Kapelanski v. Johnson, 390 F.3d 525, 530 (7th Cir.2004). \"As long as\nthere is a reasonable basis in the record to support it, we will not overturn a jury's verdict.\" Robinson v. Burlington\nNorthern R.R. Co., 131 F.3d 648, 656 (7th Cir. 1997).\nOn Count 1, the jury was instructed as follows:\nTo succeed on this claim, Thompson must prove that he was concealing a weapon or contraband\non his person. `Reasonable suspicion' exists when a reasonably, prudent person would be\nwarranted, based on specific and articulable facts, in believing that the person being searched\nwas concealing a weapon or contraband. In determining whether reasonable suspicion existed,\nyou are to consider all of the circumstances that existed at the time.\nSee Jury Instructions at 16.\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that jail\nofficials do not violate the Fourth Amendment by strip searching pretrial detainees after contact visits. In the wake\nof Bell, however, a number of circuit courts, including the Seventh, have held that not all strip searches on pretrial\ndetainees pass constitutional muster. Specifically, courts have held that strip searches at the time of intake of a\ndetainee accused of a minor offense violate the Fourth Amendment unless correctional officers have reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the detainee is concealing contraband. See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d\n107, 111 (1st Cir.2001); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d\n393, 395 (10th Cir.1993); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir.1983). These courts have\nrecognized the particularly invasive nature of a strip search and have distinguished Bell by noting that Bell\ninvolved detainees charged with serious federal crimes and not individuals charged with misdemeanor or traffic\n\noffenses and that Bell involved strip searches after contact visits and not at intake. See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723\nF.2d at 1272.\nThompson contends that there was no evidence at trial indicating that the defendants had reasonable suspicion\nto perform a strip search upon him. In response, defendants offer twenty-four supposed pieces of evidence which\nthey contend support a finding of reasonable suspicion. Defendants' submission, however, subdivides the\nevidence into such microscopic portions as to render it nearly unrecognizable. Each of the multifarious bits of\n813 evidence cited by defendants *813 can be classified in one of five categories: evidence that detainees have been\nobserved in the holding areas holding contraband, passing contraband, and leaving contraband behind; evidence\nthat Thompson knew the day before he was taken into custody that he would likely be going to jail; evidence that\nThompson did not turn in his tie and wallet to booking officers; evidence that Sheriffs deputies had no way of\nknowing anything about Thompson's criminal background; and evidence indicating that, prior to the strip search,\n[1]\nThompson had contact with other detainees, including individuals accused of violent and/or drug offenses.\nDefendants first argue that the jury could have found reasonable suspicion based on testimony that \"[m]any\ndetainees engage in conversations in all the holding cells and have been observed huddling together, squatting\nnear each other, holding contraband, passing contraband, [and] leaving contraband in holding cells.\" See Def.\nResp. at 11. In Mary Beth G., the defendant offered similar non-specific testimony that a few items had been\nrecovered from the body cavities of women arrested on minor charges as well as more specific testimony that in\none study conducted over a thirty-five day period, contraband was found on women charged with offenses such\nas prostitution, assault, and drug possession. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73. The court held that the\nnonspecific testimony, even in combination with the specific testimony, did not create a reasonable suspicion that\nminor offenders were concealing contraband. Id. at 1273. In this case, defendants offered only non-specific\nevidence that Sheriffs deputies have seen unspecified detainees exchanging contraband and that the deputies\nhave recovered contraband in the holding cells. Defendants offered no historical evidence indicating that\ncontraband was brought to the holding cells by anyone charged with minor offenses, let alone persons detained\nfor civil contempt, which is not a crime at all. Consequently, as in Mary Beth G., this evidence does not support a\nfinding of reasonable suspicion.\nDefendants next argue that Sheriffs deputies had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search because\nThompson knew the day before he was taken into custody that he would likely be going to jail and because he\ndid not turn in his tie and wallet to booking officers. Defendants offered no evidence, however, indicating that the\nSheriffs deputies who conducted the strip search or any other sheriffs deputy or jail employee had any clue about\nthis at the time Thompson was strip searched. Indeed, the evidence was essentially undisputed that defendants\nperformed the strip search on all incoming detainees, without regard to their individual circumstances,\nbackgrounds, or the reasons why each was being detained and without consideration of whether there was any\ninformation particular to the detainee indicating a suspicion he might possess contraband. For this reason, these\nfacts cannot support a finding of reasonable suspicion. See Kaniff v. United States, 351 F.3d 780, 785 (7th\nCir.2003) (stating that district court properly determined whether reasonable suspicion was present by examining\nthe facts known to the officer at the time of the search). See generally Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 85, 107\nS.Ct. 1013, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987) (holding that constitutionality of search must be judged \"in light of the\n[2]\ninformation available to [the officers] at the time they acted.\").\n814 *814 Defendants next argue that they showed reasonable suspicion existed by offering evidence that they had no\nrecord of Thompson's prior criminal history at the time of the search. Defendants have not explained nor cited\ncases for the somewhat remarkable proposition that the lack of information can create reasonable suspicion. The\ngeneral rule promulgated by the Supreme Court is that to establish reasonable suspicion, police officers must be\nable to point to \"specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\nreasonably warrant [an] intrusion.\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Absent\ncase law to the contrary, the Court declines to find that the absence of criminal history information00 information\n97\nthat likely was available to the Sheriff and the County if they had taken the time to look for it00supports the finding\n97\nof reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a strip search. Such a rule would encourage law enforcement\nofficers and jailers to deliberately refrain from accessing detainees' criminal histories to justify strip searches in\nsituations where they have been denounced as unconstitutional.\n\nDefendants also contend that Sheriffs deputies had reasonable suspicion because Thompson was intermingled\nwith the general jail population. The First, Second, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have rejected intermingling as\na sole basis for finding the reasonable suspicion that supports strip searches on pretrial detainees. See Roberts,\n239 F.3d at 113; Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396; Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.\n1989); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir.1988).\nThe defendants have not cited, and the Court has not found, any case holding otherwise.\nFour of those five circuits00all but the Second00have stated that intermingling may be one non-determinative factor\n97 97\nused to evaluate whether reasonable suspicion is present. The courts recognizing intermingling as a factor have\nnot described what makes intermingling relevant in determining whether reasonable suspicion is present. One\ncourt has said that in evaluating reasonable suspicion, heavy reliance on intermingling is misplaced where such\nintermingling is both \"limited and avoidable.\" See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 619 (9th Cir.1984). These\ncourts also treat other factors, such as the offense charged, as much more significant in assessing whether\nreasonable suspicion is present. See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447 (finding reasonable suspicion where detainee\ncharged with grand theft auto offense was intermingled with general population); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391,\n394 (10th Cir.1984) (finding no reasonable suspicion where detainee charged with traffic offenses was\nintermingled with general population).\nThis Court likewise does not believe that the Sheriffs decision to intermingle detainees held on serious criminal\ncharges together with those who, like Thompson, are held not on any sort of criminal charge but rather as a\ncoercive sanction for civil contempt can appropriately be a significant factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis,\nassuming that it is properly considered at all. Though we are cognizant that courts must accord prison and jail\n815 administrators deference in adopting and *815 executing policies and practices needed to preserve order,\ndiscipline, and security, see, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, defendants point to no evidence\nregarding the reasons for the Sheriff's decision to intermingle all detainees, criminal and civil, irrespective of the\nreasons why they are brought to the jail for intake. Thus there is no basis to support a determination that\nintermingling is based on anything more than considerations of administrative convenience. For these reasons,\nand because the decision to intermingle is entirely within the Sheriff's control, it would be inappropriate to give\nthis factor significant, let alone controlling weight in the reasonable suspicion analysis. Were the law otherwise, a\njailer could essentially create, at his discretion, a basis for blanket strip searches of detainees irrespective of the\npresence of individualized reasonable suspicion.\nIn sum, the evidence of intermingling in this case did not support the \"particularized suspicion\" required to\nsupport such an invasive search. See Chapman, 989 F.2d at 398; Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69. Thompson was not\ncharged with any crime, let alone one generally associated with violence or contraband, and there was no\nevidence that Sheriff's deputies noticed anything suspicious about him which would have otherwise justified the\nsearch.\nThe only other evidence that defendants cite to support the jury's determination of reasonable suspicion was the\nnon-specific and unquantified testimony that contraband has been found in the jail's holding cells. This adds\nnothing to the intermingling argument00indeed, it is logically part of that same contention00and it does not support\n97 97\nthe jury's verdict.\nThe Court recognizes that it must consider the evidence cited by the defendants in support of a finding of\nreasonable suspicion as a whole, not as separate and unconnected bits of evidence. See United States. v.\nBrown, 232 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir.2000) (court should look to the record as a whole to determine whether\nreasonable suspicion is present). But even when we do so, the manifest weight of the evidence was contrary to\nthe jury's verdict. See Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 (holding that non-specific evidence that the jail had problems with\ncontraband together with evidence of intermingling was not enough to support a finding of reasonable suspicion).\nFinally, defendants maintain that a jury could have concluded that a search never occurred because there was\nsome evidence that Sheriff's deputies never actually looked into Thompson's rectum. But defendants do not\ndispute that Thompson was strip searched. The fact that Sheriff's deputies may not have examined Thompson's\nrectum does not alter the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. See Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1043\n\n(7th Cir.1995) (requiring reasonable suspicion for strip search); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (requiring\nreasonable suspicion for visual body cavity search).\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court grants Thompson's motion for a new trial as it concerns Count 1 but\ndenies the motion as it concerns Counts 2 and 3 [docket no. 113]. The case is set for a status hearing on April\n27, 2006 at 9:30 a.m. for the purpose of setting a date for the retrial of Count 1. Trial counsel are directed to\nappear.\n[1] For instance, defendants' evidentiary points numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and 18 all amount to a contention\nthat Thompson was intermingled with other detainees while in custody prior to the strip search.\n[2] Defendants presented no evidence that at the time of the strip search any jail official had knowledge that\nThompson knew he might be incarcerated the day before he was taken into custody or that Thompson failed to\nturn in his tie or wallet to booking officers. For this reason, defendants cannot rely on the collective knowledge\ndoctrine to establish reasonable suspicion. See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 231, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83\nL.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (holding that knowledge of one officer can be imputed to arresting officer when determining\nwhether probable cause existed to arrest).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

KENNELLY, District Judge:\nPlaintiff Lawrence Thompson sued Cook County and Sheriff Michael Sheahan for\nallegedly violating his constitutional rights while he was incarcerated in the Cook County Jail for\ncivil contempt.  He claims that jail officials subjected him to an unreasonable strip search in\nviolation of his Fourth Amendment rights (Count 1) and performed an invasive urethral\nswabbing procedure without his consent in violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights (Counts 2 and 3).  On February 7, 2006, a jury found in favor of the defendants on all\ncounts.  Thompson has moved for a new trial.  For the following reasons, the Court orders a new\ntrial on Count 1 but otherwise denies Thompsonโs motion.  \nFacts\nOn October 9, 2002, a judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County found Thompson in\ncivil contempt and ordered him held in custody after Thompson refused to sign certain\ndocuments related to his pending divorce proceedings.  Cook County Sheriffโs deputies took\n\nThompson into custody and transported him to the Cook County Jail along with other\nindividuals, some of whom were already wearing jail-issued clothing.  \nUpon arrival at the jail, Thompson was processed along with approximately 250 other\nnew inmates.  After spending some time in a holding pen, Thompson and the others were\nphotographed and given identification cards.  An employee from Cermak Health Services, the\nagency responsible for administering medical treatment to detainees at the Cook County Jail,\nthen asked Thompson a number of medical screening questions.  During the interview,\nThompson responded to questions on a standard form concerning his medical history and signed\nthe following โconsent for treatmentโ portion of the form: \nI consent to a medical and mental health history and physical including screening for\ntuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases as part of the intake process of the Cook\nCounty Jail.  I also consent to ongoing medical treatment by Cermak Health Services staff\nfor problems identified during this process.  I understand I may be asked to sign forms\nallowing other medical treatments.  I understand that every effort will be made by CHS\nstaff to keep my medical problems confidential.  I understand the policy of CHS\nregarding access to health care at Cook County Jail.  \nAt trial, the defendants presented evidence that during the interview, a Cook County Jail\nemployee informed Thompson of his right to refuse the medical screening.  Thompson denied\nthat anyone informed him of his right to refuse consent.  \nFollowing the medical screening interview, Thompsonโs personal property was\ninventoried.  He and other inmates then underwent a urethral swabbing procedure.  Thompson\ntestified that a man who referred to himself as the โdick doctorโ addressed the group, making\nvarious threats, such as โyou donโt want to piss-off the dick doctor.โ  The inmates went into a\nroom, one at a time, to undergo the procedure.  Thompson testified that when it was his turn, the\nindividual performing the procedure directed him to take out his penis and hang it over a garbage\n2\n\ncan and then inserted into Thompsonโs urethra a metal rod with a swab on the end.  Thompson\nclaims that he felt pain both during and after the procedure.  \nThe defendants conceded that in 2002, it was the policy of Cermak Health Services, in\nconjunction with the Cook County Department of Health and the City of Chicago Department of\nHealth, to conduct urethral swabbing on male detainees entering Cook County Jail to screen for\nsyphilis and chlamydia.  The defendants aver that this joint project was developed for purposes of\npromoting the health of inmates.  Melvin Judkins, a paramedic who has worked for Cermak\nHealth Services for seventeen years, testified that the test involves inserting a thin swab a short\ndistance into the urethra and gently rotating it to collect any organisms or inflammatory cells. \nAfter the urethral swabbing procedure, Department of Corrections officers escorted\nThompson and other inmates into a receiving tunnel in groups of forty to fifty at a time.  The\nofficers lined them up on both sides of the hallway and ordered them to take off their clothes and\nplace them on the ground in front of them.  The officers then instructed Thompson and the others\nto face the wall, run their fingers through their hair, and then bend or squat and cough.  After\nordering the inmates to hold up each item of clothing for inspection, the officers allowed them to\nget dressed.\nDuring closing argument, Thompsonโs attorney contended that the strip search violated\nthe Fourth Amendmentโs prohibition against unreasonable searches.  He also maintained that\nbecause Thompson did not consent to the urethral swabbing, the defendants violated Thompsonโs\nFourth Amendment and due process rights to be free from unjustified intrusions into his body\nand to refuse unwanted medical treatment.  In response, the defendantsโ attorney argued that\nThompson knew what he was doing when he signed the medical consent form and that the strip\n3\n\nsearch was reasonable because defendants reasonably suspected that Thompson was concealing\ncontraband on his person.\nAfter a four day trial, the jury returned a verdict in the defendantsโ favor on all counts. \nDiscussion \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a) permits a court to grant a motion for a new trial if\nthe juryโs verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence or the trial was unfair to the\nmoving party.  Allison v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 979 F.2d 1187, 1196 (7th Cir. 1992).  Thompson\nmakes three principal arguments in support of his motion for a new trial:  a Cook County\nemployee was erroneously allowed to remain on the jury; the defendantsโ attorney improperly\nand inaccurately referred to Thompson as a โrich lawyerโ during closing argument; and the clear\nweight of the evidence indicated that jail officers lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the strip\nsearch.\n1.  Failure to excuse juror for cause\nAt trial, one of the prospective jurors was a medical doctor who chairs the\nneuroanesthesiology department at Stroger Hospital, which is managed by the Cook County\nBureau of Health Services, the same administrative agency that manages Cermak Health\nServices.  Thompson challenged this juror for cause, arguing that a Cook County employee\nresponsible for administering medical treatment would unfairly favor the defendants.  The Court\noverruled Thompsonโs challenge after the juror insisted that he could be impartial, and the juror\nwas seated after Thompson declined to use a peremptory challenge to remove him.  This juror\nwas eventually elected the juryโs foreperson.  Thompson argues that he was denied a fair trial\nbecause the Court allowed the juror to remain on the jury.\n4\n\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that district courts should excuse certain jurors who have a\nparticularly close relationship to the litigants.  See United States v. Polichemi, 219 F.3d 698, 704\n(7th Cir. 2000) (โA court must excuse a juror for cause if the juror is related to one of the parties\nin the case[] or if the juror has even a tiny financial interest in the case.โ).  Id.  Though such a\njuror may be objective in fact, the law errs on the side of caution and requires the jurorโs\ndismissal.  Id.  In Polichemi, the district court declined to disqualify a juror who was employed\nby the same United States Attorneyโs office that was prosecuting the case before the court.  Id. at\n705.  The court of appeals said that it agreed with the United States that โgovernment\nemployment alone is not, and should not be, enough to trigger the [common law] rule under\nwhich an employee is disqualified from serving as a juror in a case involving her employer.โ  Id.\nat 704.  The court concluded, however, that an employee of the same prosecutorโs office was too\nclosely related to the lawsuit and should have been struck for cause.  Id. at 705.\nThe Seventh Circuit has not directly considered โ so far as the Court can ascertain โ\nwhether employees are prohibited from serving on juries involving their employers,\nnotwithstanding the common lawโs contrary rule.  The Ninth Circuit, however, has held that it is\nnot an abuse of discretion to allow such an employee to serve.  See Nathan v. Boeing Co., 116\nF.3d 422, 425 (9th Cir. 1997).   In Nathan, two potential jurors were employees of the defendant\ncorporation, but nothing else in the record indicated that they could not render impartial verdicts. \nThe court said there was no per se rule prohibiting an employee of a party from serving on a jury\nand held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the jurors to serve.  \nAs noted earlier, the juror at issue in the present case is an employee and department chair\nof Stroger Hospital.  Stroger Hospital and Cermak Health Services, the agency whose employees\n5\n\nperformed the urethral swabbing procedure on Thompson, are both part of the Cook County\nBureau of Health Services, a government agency that employs thousands of individuals.  The\njuror stated during voir dire that he had administered anesthesia to jail inmates in the past, and he\nis casual friends with Ruth Rothstein, the director of the Cook County Department of Public\nHealth, and Callie Baird, the Director of the Cook County Department of Corrections.  Both\nRothstein and Baird were originally parties to the lawsuit but were no longer parties at the time\nof trial.  \nThough the question is a close one, the Court concludes that it did not err by refusing to\nstrike the juror for cause.  The Seventh Circuitโs comments in Polichemi suggest that it would\nnot disapprove of a government employee sitting on a jury involving his or her employer. \nIndeed, unlike the juror who was an employee of the United States Attorneyโs office, the juror in\nthis case did not work with any of the witnesses or attorneys involved in the trial.   Rather, the\nrelationship of the juror to the defendants in this case is no closer than the relationship at issue in\nNathan, where the prospective jurors were employees of a large corporate defendant.  Our juror\nis also casual friends with Baird and Rothstein, but neither of them were parties or witnesses in\nthe lawsuit, and for that reason, the relationship does not suggest potential bias.  See United\nStates v. Beasley, 48 F.3d 262, 267 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding that trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by allowing juror, whose brother was Madison chief of police, to serve in case\ninvolving crime that occurred in Madison).   For these reasons, the Court concludes that in light\nof the jurorโs insistence, upon careful questioning, that he could remain impartial, his relationship\nwith the defendants alone was not enough to indicate bias.\nThe two cases cited by Thompson on this issue do not support his argument.  In Crawford\n6\n\nv. United States, 212 U.S. 183 (1909), the Court held that a United States Post Office employee\ncould not sit as a juror in a prosecution of an individual charged with conspiracy to defraud the\npost office, but that case was overruled by statute in 1935.  See United States v. Wood, 299 U.S.\n123, 132 (1936).  In Vasey v. Martin Marietta Corp., 29 F.3d 1460, 1468 (10th Cir. 1994), a\npotential jurorโs employer had a consulting contract with the defendant, and the juror had\ninterviewed and hired a number of the defendantโs former employees.  Id.  The court held that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the juror to serve.  Vasey, like Nathan,\nactually supports defendantsโ contention that an employee of one of the parties may serve on the\njury.\n2. Defendantsโ closing argument\nThompson next argues that he did not receive a fair trial because the defendantsโ attorney\nmade improper comments during his closing argument.  Specifically, Thompson claims it was\nimproper for defendantsโ attorney to refer to Thompson as a โrich lawyerโ when the defendantsโ\nattorney had copies of Thompsonโs tax returns (which indicated that he was not rich) and\nattended the foreclosure hearing involving Thompsonโs home.  Thompson also claims it was\nimproper for the defendantsโ attorney to suggest that Thompson had changed his appearance to\nprevent witnesses from recognizing him. \nThese isolated comments were not enough to render the trial unfair.  The Court instructed\nthe jury more than once that closing arguments are not evidence and that the juryโs verdict should\nbe based on the evidence alone.  Given this instruction, coupled with the insignificant nature of\nthe comments in the context of the closing arguments, the Court is confident that the jury\n7\n\nconsidered only evidence that was presented at trial.   See Ramsey v. American Air Filter, Co.,\nInc., 772 F.2d 1303, 1311 (7th Cir. 1985) (โ[A] partyโs improper comments during closing\narguments rarely rise to the level of reversible error.โ)\nThe cases that Thompson cites do not demand a different result.  In Joseph v. Brierton,\n739 F.2d 1244, 1247 (7th Cir. 1984), defense counsel inappropriately took advantage of a ruling\nbarring plaintiffโs counsel from mentioning that the defendants would be indemnified if found\nliable by extensively arguing that a judgment would financially ruin his clients.  Joseph does not\ncontrol the outcome of this case, because there was no in limine ruling preventing defendants\nfrom discussing Thompsonโs wealth, and the โrich lawyerโ comment was far more isolated than\nthe comments at issue in Joseph.  Cases recognizing the impropriety of remarks concerning the\nrelative wealth of the parties also do not control this case.  See Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174\nF.3d 352, 364 (3d Cir. 1999); Adams Labs., Inc. v. Jacobs Engโg, 761 F.2d 1218, 1226 (7th Cir.\n1985).   Defendantsโ counsel made no such remarks during closing argument.\nThompson also maintains that the defendantsโ attorneyโs comments concerning\nThompsonโs changed appearance violated the rule against referring to missing witnesses.  โThat\nrule permits an inference of unfavorable testimony from the missing witness, but only if that\nwitness is peculiarly within the opposing partyโs power to produce.โ  Littlefield v. McGuffey, 954\nF.2d 1337, 1346 (7th Cir. 1992).  Thompson did not object to evidence concerning his changed\nappearance, and though the argument might have sought an unsupported inferential leap, the\ncomments were insignificant, even when considered together with the comment describing\nThompson as a โrich lawyer.โ \n8\n\n3. Weight of evidence on strip search claim\nFinally, Thompson argues that the juryโs verdict on Count 1, in which he alleged that the\ndefendants subjected him to an unreasonable body cavity search, was against the manifest weight\nof the evidence.  A court considering a motion for new trial may not set aside the juryโs verdict\nโif a reasonable basis exists in the record to support the verdict, viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the prevailing party, and leaving issues of credibility and weight of the\nevidence to the jury.โ  Kapelanski v. Johnson, 390 F.3d 525, 520 (7th Cir. 2004).  โAs long as\nthere is a reasonable basis in the record to support it, we will not overturn a juryโs verdict.โ \nRobinson v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., 131 F.3d 648, 656 (7th Cir. 1997).\nOn Count 1, the jury was instructed as follows:\nTo succeed on this claim, Thompson must prove that there was no reasonable suspicion\nthat he was concealing a weapon or contraband on his person.  โReasonable suspicionโ\nexists when a reasonably prudent person would be warranted, based on specific and\narticulable facts, in believing that the person being searched was concealing a weapon or\ncontraband.  In determining whether reasonable suspicion existed, you are to consider all\nof the circumstances that existed at the time.  \nSee Jury Instructions at 16.  \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979), the Supreme Court held that jail officials do\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment by strip searching pretrial detainees after contact visits.  In the\nwake of Bell, however, a number of circuit courts, including the Seventh, have held that not all\nstrip searches on pretrial detainees pass constitutional muster.  Specifically, courts have held that\nstrip searches at the time of intake of a detainee accused of a minor offense violate the Fourth\nAmendment unless correctional officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that the detainee is\n9\n\nconcealing contraband.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 111 (1st Cir. 2001);\nWilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395\n(10th Cir. 1993); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983).  These\ncourts have recognized the particularly invasive nature of a strip search and have distinguished\nBell by noting that Bell involved detainees charged with serious federal crimes and not\nindividuals charged with misdemeanor or traffic offenses and that Bell involved strip searches\nafter contact visits and not at intake.  See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272. \nThompson contends that there was no evidence at trial indicating that the defendants had\nreasonable suspicion to perform a strip search upon him.  In response, defendants offer twenty-\nfour supposed pieces of evidence which they contend support a finding of reasonable suspicion. \nDefendantsโ submission, however, subdivides the evidence into such microscopic portions as to\nrender it nearly unrecognizable.  Each of the multifarious bits of evidence cited by defendants\ncan be classified in one of five categories:  evidence that detainees have been observed in the\nholding areas holding contraband, passing contraband, and leaving contraband behind; evidence\nthat Thompson knew the day before he was taken into custody that he would likely be going to\njail; evidence that Thompson did not turn in his tie and wallet to booking officers; evidence that\nSheriffโs deputies had no way of knowing anything about Thompsonโs criminal background; and\nevidence indicating that, prior to the strip search, Thompson had contact with other detainees,\nincluding individuals accused of violent and/or drug offenses.1 \n1 For instance, defendantsโ evidentiary points numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and 18 all\namount to a contention that Thompson was intermingled with other detainees while in custody\nprior to the strip search.  \n10\n\nDefendants first argue that the jury could have found reasonable suspicion based on\ntestimony that โ[m]any detainees engage in conversations in all the holding cells and have been\nobserved huddling together, squatting near each other, holding contraband, passing contraband,\n[and] leaving contraband in holding cells.โ  See Def. Resp. at 11.  In Mary Beth G., the defendant\noffered similar non-specific testimony that a few items had been recovered from the body\ncavities of women arrested on minor charges as well as more specific testimony that in one study\nconducted over a thirty-five day period, contraband was found on women charged with offenses\nsuch as prostitution, assault, and drug possession.  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73.  The court\nheld that the non-specific testimony, even in combination with the specific testimony, did not\ncreate a reasonable suspicion that minor offenders were concealing contraband.  Id. at 1273.  In\nthis case, defendants offered only non-specific evidence that Sheriffโs deputies have seen\nunspecified detainees exchanging contraband and that the deputies have recovered contraband in\nthe holding cells.  Defendants offered no historical evidence indicating that contraband was\nbrought to the holding cells by anyone charged with minor offenses, let alone persons detained\nfor civil contempt, which is not a crime at all.  Consequently, as in Mary Beth G., this evidence\ndoes not support a finding of reasonable suspicion.  \nDefendants next argue that Sheriffโs deputies had reasonable suspicion to conduct the\nsearch because Thompson knew the day before he was taken into custody that he would likely be\ngoing to jail and because he did not turn in his tie and wallet to booking officers.  Defendants\noffered no evidence, however, indicating that the Sheriffโs deputies who conducted the strip\nsearch or any other sheriffโs deputy or jail employee had any clue about this at the time\nThompson was strip searched.  Indeed, the evidence was essentially undisputed that defendants\n11\n\nperformed the strip search on all incoming detainees, without regard to their individual\ncircumstances, backgrounds, or the reasons why each was being detained and without\nconsideration of whether there was any information particular to the detainee indicating a\nsuspicion he might possess contraband.  For this reason, these facts cannot support a finding of\nreasonable suspicion.  See Kaniff v. United States, 351 F.3d 780, 785 (7th Cir. 2003) (stating that\ndistrict court properly determined whether reasonable suspicion was present by examining the\nfacts known to the officer at the time of the search).  See generally Maryland v. Garrison, 480\nU.S. 79, 85 (1987) (holding that constitutionality of search must be judged โin light of the\ninformation available to [the officers] at the time they acted.โ).2\nDefendants next argue that they showed reasonable suspicion existed by offering\nevidence that they had no record of Thompsonโs prior criminal history at the time of the search. \nDefendants have not explained nor cited cases for the somewhat remarkable proposition that the\nlack of information can create reasonable suspicion.  The general rule promulgated by the\nSupreme Court is that to establish reasonable suspicion, police officers must be able to point to\nโspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\nreasonably warrant [an] intrusion.โ  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968).  Absent case law to the\ncontrary, the Court declines to find that the absence of criminal history information โ information\nthat likely was available to the Sheriff and the County if they had taken the time to look for it โ\n2 Defendants presented no evidence that at the time of the strip search any jail official had\nknowledge that Thompson knew he might be incarcerated the day before he was taken into\ncustody or that Thompson failed to turn in his tie or wallet to booking officers.  For this reason,\ndefendants cannot rely on the collective knowledge doctrine to establish reasonable suspicion. \nSee United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 231 (1985) (holding that knowledge of one officer\ncan be imputed to arresting officer when determining whether probable cause existed to arrest). \n12\n\nsupports the finding of reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a strip search.  Such a rule\nwould encourage law enforcement officers and jailers to deliberately refrain from accessing\ndetaineesโ criminal histories to justify strip searches in situations where they have been\ndenounced as unconstitutional.\nDefendants also contend that Sheriffโs deputies had reasonable suspicion because\nThompson was intermingled with the general jail population.  The First, Second, Sixth, Ninth,\nand Tenth Circuits have rejected intermingling as a sole basis for finding the reasonable\nsuspicion that supports strip searches on pretrial detainees.  See Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113;\nChapman, 989 F.2d at 396; Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.\n1989); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66,\n69 (2d Cir. 1988).  The defendants have not cited, and the Court has not found, any case holding\notherwise.  \nFour of those five circuits โ all but the Second โ have stated that intermingling may be\none non-determinative factor used to evaluate whether reasonable suspicion is present.  The\ncourts recognizing intermingling as a factor have not described what makes intermingling\nrelevant in determining whether reasonable suspicion is present.  One court has said that in\nevaluating reasonable suspicion, heavy reliance on intermingling is misplaced where such\nintermingling is both โlimited and avoidable.โ  See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 619 (9th\nCir. 1984).  These courts also treat other factors, such as the offense charged, as much more\nsignificant in assessing whether reasonable suspicion is present.  See Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n1447 (finding reasonable suspicion where detainee charged with grand theft auto offense was\nintermingled with general population); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984)\n13\n\n(finding no reasonable suspicion where detainee charged with traffic offenses was intermingled\nwith general population).  \nThis Court likewise does not believe that the Sheriffโs decision to intermingle detainees\nheld on serious criminal charges together with those who, like Thompson, are held not on any\nsort of criminal charge but rather as a coercive sanction for civil contempt can appropriately be a\nsignificant factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis, assuming that it is properly considered at\nall.  Though we are cognizant that courts must accord prison and jail administrators deference in\nadopting and executing policies and practices needed to preserve order, discipline, and security,\nsee, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 547-48, defendants point to no evidence regarding the reasons for the\nSheriffโs decision to intermingle all detainees, criminal and civil, irrespective of the reasons why\nthey are brought to the jail for intake.  Thus there is no basis to support a determination that\nintermingling is based on anything more than considerations of administrative convenience.  For\nthese reasons, and because the decision to intermingle is entirely within the Sheriffโs control, it\nwould be inappropriate to give this factor significant, let alone controlling weight in the\nreasonable suspicion analysis.  Were the law otherwise, a jailer could essentially create, at his\ndiscretion, a basis for blanket strip searches of detainees irrespective of the presence of\nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  \nIn sum, the evidence of intermingling in this case did not support the โparticularized\nsuspicionโ required to support such an invasive search.  See Chapman, 989 F.2d at 398; Walsh,\n849 F.2d at 69.  Thompson was not charged with any crime, let alone one generally associated\nwith violence or contraband, and there was no evidence that Sheriffโs deputies noticed anything\nsuspicious about him which would have otherwise justified the search.   \n14\n\nThe only other evidence that defendants cite to support the juryโs determination of\nreasonable suspicion was the non-specific and unquantified testimony that contraband has been\nfound in the jailโs holding cells.  This adds nothing to the intermingling argument โ indeed, it is\nlogically part of that same contention โ and it does not support the juryโs verdict.\nThe Court recognizes that it must consider the evidence cited by the defendants in support\nof a finding of reasonable suspicion as a whole, not as separate and unconnected bits of evidence. \nSee United States. v. Brown, 232 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 2000) (court should look to the record\nas a whole to determine whether reasonable suspicion is present).  But even when we do so, the\nmanifest weight of the evidence was contrary to the juryโs verdict.  See Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112\n(holding that non-specific evidence that the jail had problems with contraband together with\nevidence of intermingling was not enough to support a finding of reasonable suspicion).  \n  Finally, defendants maintain that a jury could have concluded that a search never\noccurred because there was some evidence that Sheriffโs deputies never actually looked into\nThompsonโs rectum.  But defendants do not dispute that Thompson was strip searched.  The fact\nthat Sheriffโs deputies may not have examined Thompsonโs rectum does not alter the Courtโs\nFourth Amendment analysis.  See Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1043 (7th Cir. 1995)\n(requiring reasonable suspicion for strip search); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (requiring\nreasonable suspicion for visual body cavity search).\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court grants Thompsonโs motion for a new trial as it\nconcerns Count 1 but denies the motion as it concerns Counts 2 and 3 [docket no. 113].  The case \n15\n\nis set for a status hearing on April 27, 2006 at 9:30 a.m. for the purpose of setting a date for the\nretrial of Count 1.  Trial counsel are directed to appear.\n____________________________________\nMATTHEW F. KENNELLY\n United States District Judge\nDate: April 18, 2006 (corrected July 6, 2006)\n16",
