In  accordance  with  the  Supreme  Court’s \nholding in Newport, the Tenth Circuit, as well as courts in \n Footnotes \n \n1  A statute is defined as “an enactment made by a legislature and expressed in a formal document.” The American College \n  3 \n \n\nAllen v. Board of County Com’rs of County of Wyandotte, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1990)   \n \n  Dictionary 1181 (1963). \n \n2  An ordinance is defined as “a public injunction or regulation.” The American College Dictionary 853 (1963). In its most common \nmeaning, the term is used to designate the enactments of the legislative body of a municipality. Black’s Law Dictionary 989 \n \n(1979). \n \n3  A regulation is defined as “a rule or order, as for conduct, prescribed by authority; a governing direction or law.” The American \nCollege Dictionary 1021 (1963). More specifically, a regulation is a “rule or order having force of law issued by executive \n \nauthority of government.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (1979). \n \n4  Respondeat superior means literally “let the master answer.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1179 (1979). The Kansas Supreme Court \nrecently summarized several of the general principles relating to the law of respondeat superior: \n \nThe general rule is that the principal and agent are jointly and severally liable for the tortious conduct of the agent for whose \nconduct he is responsible, and that, as a result, they may be joined in a single suit and a judgment may be obtained against each. \nAtkinson v. Wichita Clinic, P.A., 243 Kan. 705, 707, 763 P.2d 1085, 1087 (1988) (quoting Sell, Agency § 94, 83–84 (1975)). \nUnder Kansas law, there is no distinction between the liability of a principal for the torts of his or her agent and the liability of a \nmaster for the torts of his or her servant. Liability in both cases is based upon the doctrine of respondeat superior. Simpson v. \nTownsley, 283 F.2d 743, 746 (10th Cir.1960); Jacob v. Parrill, 186 Kan. 467, 472–73, 351 P.2d 194, 199 (1960). \n \n5  Defendant cites Marks v. Lyon County Bd. of County Comm’rs, 590 F.Supp. 1129 (D.Kan.1984) and Lee v. Wyandotte County, \nKansas, 586 F.Supp. 236 (D.Kan.1984) in support of its argument that the conduct of the sheriff and his subordinates cannot be \n \nattributed to the Board. In these cases, the plaintiffs were attempting to proceed upon alleged violations of their constitutional and \ncivil rights. Marks, supra, 590 F.Supp. at 1132; Lee, supra, 586 F.Supp. at 238. The doctrine of respondeat superior may not be \nused to impose liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a municipality. Monell v. Dep’t of Social Serv., 436 U.S. at 691. The \ninstant case, however, may be distinguished from Marks and Lee because Allen is asserting the doctrine of respondeat superior to \nimpose liability for the state law tort claims of battery, false imprisonment, and negligence. \n \n6  The provisions and requirements of subsection (d) provide in pertinent part as follows: \nThe notice shall be filed with the clerk or governing body of the municipality and shall contain the following: (1) The name and \n \naddress of the claimant and the name and address of the claimant’s attorney, if any; (2) a concise statement of the factual basis of \nthe claim, including the date, time, place and circumstances of the act, omission or event complained of; (3) the name and \naddress of any public officer or employee involved, if known; (4) a concise statement of the nature and extent of the injury \nclaimed to have been suffered; and (5) a statement of the amount of monetary damages that is being requested ... Once notice of \nthe claim is filed, no action shall be commenced until after the claimant has received notice from the municipality that it has \ndenied the claim or until after 120 days ... \nK.S.A.1989 Supp. 12–105b(d). See also Stevenson v. Topeka City Council, 245 Kan. 425, 427–28, 781 P.2d 689, 692 (1989) \n(K.S.A. 12–105b(d) requires plaintiff to file written notice containing specific facts upon which claim is based). \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  4 \n ",

Sully, Wyandotte County\nSheriff's Dept., Joan Grogan, Roger Riley and Theodore Robinson.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nEARL E. O'CONNOR, Chief Judge.\nThis matter comes before the court on the summary judgment motion of defendants Wyandotte County Sheriff's\nDepartment, Owen L. Sully, Joan A. Grogan, Roger C. Riley and Theodore Robinson (hereinafter \"Sheriff's\nDepartment\"). Plaintiff Sarah L. Allen (hereinafter \"Allen\") was allegedly strip searched and incarcerated by the\nSheriff's Department after Kansas University police officers charged her with driving on a suspended license and\nexpired tags. Plaintiff contends defendants deprived her of her civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Allen\nalso alleges that defendants battered and falsely imprisoned her. In addition, she claims that the Sheriff's\nDepartment was negligent. We do not believe that oral argument would be helpful in this case. Plaintiff's request\npursuant to Local Rule 206(d) for oral argument will therefore be denied. For the reasons stated below, the court\nwill grant in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nDefendant officers B.D. Harrelson (hereinafter \"Harrelson\") and Sandra Omtvedt (hereinafter \"Omtvedt\"),\nmembers of the Kansas University Medical Center (hereinafter \"KUMC\") police department, stopped the driver of\na 1985 Ford Mustang on March 11, 1989, at approximately 9:30 p.m. after they observed the expiration of the\nvehicle's license tag. At the officers' request, the driver, Allen, displayed her license. The state's computer system\nrevealed that plaintiff's driver's license had been suspended. Harrelson and Omtvedt therefore performed a pat-\n1446 down search, handcuffed plaintiff, and placed her under *1446 arrest. She was then driven to the KUMC police\nstation.\nAllen was later transported to the Wyandotte County jail by Harrelson. The jail was in the charge and custody of\nSheriff Owen L. Sully (hereinafter \"Sully\"). Sergeant Roger C. Riley (hereinafter \"Riley\"), Deputy Theodore\nRobinson (hereinafter \"Robinson\"), and Deputy Joan A. Grogan (hereinafter \"Grogan\") were on duty during\nAllen's confinement at the jail. After she was escorted to the fifth floor of the jail, plaintiff claims that she was\n[1]\nunlawfully detained and subjected to a strip search by defendant Grogan.  Grogan, according to plaintiff,\nordered her to remove her clothing, exposing her breasts as well as her genitals, buttocks and anus. Allen alleges\nthat the strip search was conducted \"in a rude, insolent, abusive, and violent manner.\" More specifically, plaintiff\ncontends that she was strip searched in a closet at the jail. Allen states that the closet door remained open so\n\nanyone outside the closet could observe the strip search taking place. After the strip search, plaintiff was confined\nwith other prisoners while awaiting her release. At approximately 3:00 a.m. on March 12, Allen was released,\nhaving been charged with driving on a suspended license and expired tags.\nII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS\nIn considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must examine all the evidence in a light most favorable\nto the nonmoving party. Barber v. General Elec. Co., 648 F.2d 1272, 1276 n. 1 (10th Cir. 1981); Mahomes-Vinson\nv. United States, 751 F.Supp. 913, 916 (D.Kan.1990). A moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial is\nentitled to summary judgment only when the evidence indicates that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Fed.\nR.Civ.P. 56(c); Maughan v. S.W. Servicing, Inc., 758 F.2d 1381, 1387 (10th Cir. 1985); see also 6 J. Moore, \nMoore's Federal Practice ¶ 56.04 (1990) (court is authorized to examine materials outside complaint to determine\nwhether there is genuine issue of material fact to be tried). If the moving party does not bear the burden of proof,\nhe must show \"that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\" Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). This burden is met when the moving\nparty identifies those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of material fact. Id. at 323, 106 S.Ct.\nat 2553; Deines v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., 752 F.Supp. 989, 993 (D.Kan.1990).\nOnce the moving party meets these requirements, the burden shifts to the party resisting the motion, who \"must\nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242,\n256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (emphasis added). It is not enough for the party opposing a\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment to \"rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading.\" Id.\nGenuine factual issues must exist that \"can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be\nresolved in favor of either party.\" Id. at 250, 106 S.Ct. at 2511; Tersiner v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 740 F.Supp.\n1519, 1522-23 (D.Kan.1990).\nIII. ALLEGED DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1871 (hereinafter \"the Act\") establishes a civil action for the deprivation of federal rights.\n1447 Plaintiff Allen claims that the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department, acting under *1447 the color of state law,\n[2]\nviolated rights guaranteed to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Act is embodied in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 and provides in pertinent part as follows:\nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\nthe Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in the action at law, suit in equity, or\nother proper proceeding for redress.\nSection 1983 does not create substantive rights. Rather, this provision provides a recovery mechanism for the\ndeprivation of federal rights. Watson v. City of Kansas City, Kan., 857 F.2d 690, 694 (10th Cir. 1988); Williams v.\nAnderson, 562 F.2d 1081, 1101 (8th Cir.1977). In order to establish a cause of action under section 1983, a\nplaintiff must allege: (1) the deprivation of a federal right (2) by a person acting under color of state law. Gomez v.\nToledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); Martinez v. State of Calif., 444 U.S.\n277, 284, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558, 62 L.Ed.2d 481,reh'g denied,445 U.S. 920, 100 S.Ct. 1285, 63 L.Ed.2d 606\n(1980).\nIV. STRIP SEARCH OF PLAINTIFF\nThe Sheriff's Department claims that it was permitted and indeed required by Kansas statutory law to conduct a\n[3]\nstrip search of Allen.  Plaintiff was charged with violating K.S.A. 8-262. Subsection (a)(1) of K.S.A.1989 Supp.\n8-262 prohibits any person from driving a motor vehicle on a state highway \"at a time when such person's\n\n[4]\nprivilege to do so is ... suspended.\"  K.S.A.1989 Supp. 8-2104(a)(2) provides that a person stopped by a law\nenforcement officer for violation of K.S.A. 8-262 \"shall be taken into custody and taken without unnecessary delay\n[5]\nbefore a judge of the district court.\"\nOrdinarily, a person arrested for violation of a traffic offense is not to be strip searched \"unless there is probable\n[6]\ncause to believe that the individual is concealing a weapon or controlled substance.\" K.S.A. 22-2521(a).\n1448 Neither the arresting officers *1448 nor the guards at the jail possessed probable cause to believe that Allen was\nharboring any contraband or weapons. Subsection (b) of K.S.A. 22-2524 provides, however, that the foregoing\nprovision shall not apply \"when a person accused of a crime is, of necessity, confined with other prisoners in a jail\nwhile awaiting appearance before a magistrate.\" K.S.A. 22-2524(b) (emphasis added). Defendants note that\n[7]\n\"[Allen] was, in fact, confined with other prisoners.\"\nThe Fourth Amendment applies with its fullest vigor against any intrusion of the human body. Horton v. Goose\nCreek Indep. School Dist., 690 F.2d 470, 478,reh'g denied,693 F.2d 524 (5th Cir. 1982),cert. denied,463 U.S.\n[8]\n1207, 103 S.Ct. 3536, 77 L.Ed.2d 1387 (1983).  The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\n\"requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search\nentails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d\n[9]\n1437, 1439 (10th Cir.1986).  A strip search is a substantial intrusion of personal rights. Cruz v. Finney County,\nKan., 656 F.Supp. 1001, 1005 (D.Kan.1987); Shoemaker v. Handel, 619 F.Supp. 1089, 1101 (D.N.J.1985),aff'd,\n[10]\n795 F.2d 1136 (3d Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 986, 107 S.Ct. 577, 93 L.Ed.2d 580 (1986).  Strip searches\nmust be conducted with regard for the subject's privacy and be designed to minimize emotional and physical\ntrauma. United States v. Cameron, 538 F.2d 254, 258 (9th Cir.1976); see also N. Strossen, The Fourth\nAmendment in the Balance: Accurately Setting the Scales through the Least Intrusive Alternative Analysis, 63\nN.Y.U.L.Rev. 1173, ___ (1988) (strip searches should not be upheld unless government satisfies least intrusive\nalternative requirement).\n1449 Whether a person subject to a strip search was confined with other prisoners *1449 or detained alone in a cell is\nonly one factor to consider in judging the constitutionality of the search. Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th\n[11]\nCir.1984) (citing Smith v. Montgomery County, Md., 547 F.Supp. 592, 598-99 (D.Md.1982)).  A court must also\nconsider \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, ... and the place in which it is\nconducted.\" Bell v. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884; Bono v. Saxbe, 527 F.Supp. 1182, 1185\n[12]\n(S.D.Ill.),aff'd in part,620 F.2d 609 (7th Cir.1980).  Any policy permitting strip searches must be tightly drawn\nto assure that Fourth Amendment rights are not violated. Where the strip search of a person is conducted\npursuant to a policy or statute encompassing all arrestees and there is no reason to suspect that the person is\nharboring drugs, weapons or contraband, the search is arbitrary and purposeless, and thus unconstitutional. \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 715-16 (9th Cir.1989); Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., 767\nF.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985),cert. denied,475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Doe v.\nCalumet City, Ill., 754 F.Supp. 1211, 1220-21 (N.D.Ill.1990).\nIn the present case, the plaintiff was, as the Sheriff's Department describes her, merely a \"routine traffic offender.\"\nThere was no indication that Allen would be harmful or dangerous. She appears to have fully cooperated with the\narresting officers who conducted an exterior search of her person and the guards at the jail who \"processed\" her.\nThe infraction for which plaintiff was arrested was unrelated to drugs, weapons or predatory conduct. Further,\nAllen's detention was temporary and unplanned. Defendants have failed to articulate any reasons concerning\nappearance, demeanor or criminal history to suggest that Allen might have been concealing drugs, weapons or\ncontraband in her brassiere or in her anal or genital areas. Rather, the Sheriff's Department insists that it is\nrequired under the law of Kansas to conduct a blanket, across-the-board strip search of all individuals who are\n\"confined with other prisoners.\"\nWhile the Sheriff's Department appears to have administered Kansas statutory law in such a manner as to violate\nplaintiff's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches, we will decline to hold K.S.A. 22-2524\nunconstitutionally overbroad. Where possible, courts are to interpret legislative enactments so as to avoid raising\nserious constitutional questions. See, e.g., Cheek v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 604, 611, 112\n\nL.Ed.2d 617 (1991); DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108\nS.Ct. 1392, 1397, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988); see also Arbeitman v. Dist. Court of Vt., 522 F.2d 1031, 1034 (2d\nCir.1975) (courts are reluctant to strike down statutes where they can be validly applied in substantial number of\nsituations). In the instant case, defendants have failed to show that \"by necessity\" Allen was confined with other\n1450 prisoners *1450 while she waited to appear before a magistrate. There is no indication that the Wyandotte\nCounty jail did not have the physical capacity and capability to separate \"routine traffic offenders\" such as plaintiff\n[13]\nfrom the general jail population.  The court will therefore deny defendants' summary judgment motion as to\nAllen's section 1983 claim alleging a strip search in violation of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\nV. DETENTION OF PLAINTIFF\nAllen argues that the length of her detention by the Sheriff's Department was an unreasonable seizure of her\n[14]\nperson, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment obviously does not protect against all\nseizures. See, e.g., United States v. Walsh, 791 F.2d 811, 814 (10th Cir.1986); United States v. Espinosa, 782\nF.2d 888, 890 (10th Cir.1986). The essential inquiry when faced with challenges under the Fourth Amendment is\nwhether the seizure was reasonable. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 9, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2482, 53 L.Ed.2d\n538 (1977); O'Rourke v. City of Norman, Okla., 875 F.2d 1465, 1472 (10th Cir.1989),cert. denied,493 U.S. 918,\n110 S.Ct. 280, 107 L.Ed.2d 260 (1989); United States v. Mireles, 583 F.2d 1115, 1117 (10th Cir.),cert. denied,\n[15]\n439 U.S. 936, 99 S.Ct. 332, 58 L.Ed.2d 332 (1978).  What is a reasonable seizure depends upon all\nsurrounding circumstances, and the nature of the seizure. United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531,\n537, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3308, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985); United States v. Mireles, supra, 583 F.2d at 1117.\nIn the instant case, Allen was detained for approximately five hours from the time of her arrest to the time in\nwhich she was released from the jail. Defendants contend that her release was delayed by a disturbance or riot in\nthe jail. While plaintiff's confinement may have been slightly longer than the time in which one charged with a\ntraffic offense would ordinarily be detained under normal circumstances, we conclude that there was nothing\nunreasonable as to the amount of time in which she was confined to the Wyandotte County jail. The court will\ntherefore grant defendants' summary judgment motion as to any alleged Fourth Amendment violation concerning\nthe duration of Allen's detention.\nVI. ADEQUACY OF STATE REMEDIES\nThe Sheriffs' Department argues that plaintiff's cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must be dismissed\nbecause Allen's state tort claims of false imprisonment, battery, and negligence afford her adequate\npostdeprivation remedies. We disagree. The availability of a postdeprivation remedy in state court does not\npreclude relief under section 1983. Gilmere v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 774 F.2d 1495, 1498-99 (11th Cir.1985),cert.\n1451 denied,476 U.S. 1115, 106 S.Ct. 1970, 90 L.Ed.2d 654 (1986); Hicks v. Feeney, 770 F.2d 375, *1451 378-79 (3d\nCir.1985); Anderson v. City of New York, 611 F.Supp. 481, 491 (S.D.N.Y.1985); Spell v. McDaniel, 591 F.Supp.\n1090, 1107 (E.D.N.C.1984). Further, as discussed in section VIII of this memorandum, plaintiff is precluded from\nrecovering on her state law tort claims by exceptions to the Kansas Tort Claims Act, K.S.A. 75-6101 et seq.\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff's state law tort claims afford adequate\npostdeprivation remedies will be denied by the court.\nVII. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nIn the alternative, the defendants contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense to be asserted by government officials who are sued for their alleged performance of\ndiscretionary functions. Horwitz v. Colo. Bd. of Medical Examiners, 822 F.2d 1508, 1512 (10th Cir.),cert. denied,\n484 U.S. 964, 108 S.Ct. 453, 98 L.Ed.2d 394 (1987). Government officials performing discretionary functions are\ngenerally \"shielded from liability for civil damages in so far as their conduct does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n\n800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); Pleasant v. Lovell, 876 F.2d 787, 794 (10th Cir.1989); \nScott v. City of Overland Park, Kan., 595 F.Supp. 520, 523 (D.Kan.1984).\nOnce a defendant raises the defense of qualified immunity, the plaintiff has the burden of coming \"forward with\nfacts or allegations to show both that the defendant's alleged conduct violated the law and that the law was\nclearly established when the violation occurred.\" Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers v. Losavio, 847 F.2d 642,\n[16]\n646 (10th Cir.1988); Lutz v. Weld County School Dist., 784 F.2d 340, 342-43 (10th Cir.1986).  In meeting this\nburden, the plaintiff must do more than identify in the abstract a clearly established right and allege that the\ndefendant has violated it. Watson v. City of Kansas City, Kan., supra, 857 F.2d at 697; Pueblo Neighborhood\nHealth Centers v. Losavio, supra, 847 F.2d at 645. The plaintiff must demonstrate a substantial correspondence\nbetween the conduct in question and prior law allegedly establishing that the defendant's actions were clearly\n[17]\nprohibited. Hannula v. City of Lakewood, Colo., 907 F.2d 129, 131 (10th Cir.1990).\nThe key to this inquiry is the objective reasonableness of the official's conduct in light of the legal rules that were\nclearly established at the time the action was taken. Laidley v. McClain, 914 F.2d 1386, 1394 (10th Cir.1990); \nMelton v. City of Oklahoma City, Okla., 879 F.2d 706, 727,reh'g granted in part, 888 F.2d 724 (10th Cir.1989).\nThe \"objective reasonableness\" standard was employed by the Harlow court for determining whether an official is\nentitled to qualified immunity in order to \"avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of\nmany insubstantial claims on summary judgment.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738\n; Lewis v. City of Fort Collins, Colo., 903 F.2d 752, 755 (10th Cir.1990).\nA. Liability of Sully, Riley, and Robinson\nPlaintiff urges the court to adopt a respondeat superior theory in holding Sheriff Sully, Sergeant Riley and Deputy\n1452 Robinson liable for the deprivation of her constitutional rights. The Supreme *1452 Court, however, has declined\nto find liability based on respondeat superior under section 1983. See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327,\n334, 106 S.Ct. 662, 666, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018,\n2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Section 1983 liability must be based on more than the right to control employees. \nSmith v. Heath, 691 F.2d 220, 225 (6th Cir.1982); Fann v. City of Cleveland, Ohio, 616 F.Supp. 305, 313-14\n(N.D.Ohio 1985). There must be a showing that \"the supervisor encouraged the specific incident of misconduct or\nin some other way directly participated in it.\" Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 421 (6th Cir.) (citing Hays v.\nJefferson County, Ky., 668 F.2d 869, 872-74,reh'g denied,673 F.2d 152 (6th Cir. 1982)), cert. denied, 469 U.S.\n845, 105 S.Ct. 156, 83 L.Ed.2d 93 (1984). In the present case, there is no indication that Sheriff Sully, Sergeant\nRiley or Deputy Robinson directly participated in or otherwise encouraged the alleged strip search of Allen. Since\nthere is no competent evidence in the record of any participation or encouragement on the part of defendants\nSully, Riley, or Robinson, the court will enter summary judgment in the favor of these defendants.\nB. Liability of Grogan\nPlaintiff claims that defendant Grogan is not entitled to qualified immunity because her conduct 00 the strip search\n97\nof a routine traffic offender 00 was unreasonable. As noted above, the threshold question in determining whether\n97\nan official is entitled to qualified immunity is the objective reasonableness of his or her conduct in light of the legal\nrules that were clearly established at the time the action was taken. Laidley v. McClain, supra, 914 F.2d at 1394; \nMelton v. City of Oklahoma City, Okla., supra, 879 F.2d at 727. The law was clearly established at the time of\nplaintiff's arrest 00 March 11, 1989 00 that the strip search of traffic offenders without some level of suspicion that\n97 97\nthey are harboring drugs, contraband or weapons is per se unreasonable. See, e.g., Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, Ill., 723 F.2d 1263, 1271-73 (7th Cir.1983) (routine strip search of female misdemeanor offenders by\nfemale police personnel was unreasonable); United States v. Couch, 688 F.2d 599, 604 (9th Cir.) (strip search\npermissible only upon showing of reasonable suspicion), cert. denied,459 U.S. 857, 103 S.Ct. 128, 74 L.Ed.2d\n110 (1982); Houlton v. Mohon, 684 F.Supp. 1407, 1415 (N.D.Tex.1987) (female county employee's strip search of\nfemale traffic offender in absence of any suspicion that search would yield weapons or contraband was\n[18]\nunreasonable).  While Grogan generally denies that the alleged strip search ever took place, she concedes\nthat it would be improper to perform a strip search of a traffic offender.\n\nDefendants maintain that any strip search was justified merely because Allen was \"confined with other prisoners.\"\nDefendants, however, have failed to present any evidence that Grogan reasonably suspected plaintiff was hiding\ndrugs, contraband or a weapon on her person. Accordingly, we must conclude that Grogan's alleged strip search\nof Allen was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because Grogan did not possess\nreasonable suspicion and defendants have failed to show that \"by necessity\" Allen was confined with other\nprisoners while she waited to appear before a magistrate. In other words, there is no indication that the\nWyandotte County jail did not have the physical capacity and capability to separate \"routine traffic offenders\"\nsuch as plaintiff from the general jail population. Defendants' summary judgment motion as to the qualified\n1453 immunity of Grogan *1453 will be denied by the court.[19]\nVIII. KANSAS TORT CLAIMS ACT\nAllen has asserted pendent state law claims of battery, false imprisonment, negligence, and negligence per se.\nDefendants contend that plaintiff is precluded from recovering on these claims by the Kansas Tort Claims Act\n(hereinafter \"KTCA\"), K.S.A. 75-6101, et seq. The KTCA takes an open-ended approach to governmental liability.\nUnder the Act, governmental entities are generally liable for damages caused by the negligent or wrongful acts\nand omissions of their employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment. K.S.A. 75-6103(a); \nsee generally Note, Governmental Liability: The Kansas Tort Claims Act [or the King Can Do Wrong], 19\n[20]\nWashburn L.J. 260 (1980).  In other words, \"liability is the rule while immunity the exception.\" Dougan v.\nRossville Drainage Dist., 243 Kan. 315, 318, 757 P.2d 272, 275 (1988); Mid Am. Credit Union v. Bd. of County\nComm'rs of Sedgwick County, Kan., 15 Kan.App.2d 216, 219-20, 806 P.2d 479, 482 (1991). Ordinarily, a strict or\nnarrow interpretation must be applied to statutory exceptions. Barber v. Williams, 244 Kan. 318, 320, 767 P.2d\n1284, 1287 (1989).\nLaw enforcement officers owe a duty to the public at large to use reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in\nexercising their duties, to use their best judgment, and to exercise that reasonable degree of learning, skill and\nexperience which is ordinarily possessed by other law enforcement officers in the same or similar locations. \nShaw v. City of Olathe, Kan., 1990 WL 182366, No. 88-2353-O, slip op. at 19 (D.Kan. Oct. 16, 1990). Police\nofficers who act maliciously, or wantonly fail to exercise the care and diligence required of officers, are not\nafforded protection by the KTCA. Id.; Hopkins v. State, 237 Kan. 601, 611, 702 P.2d 311, 319 (1985). In\ndetermining whether an officers' conduct is protected by the Tort Claims Act, the court must consider the totality\nof circumstances. Hopkins v. State, supra, 237 Kan. at 611, 702 P.2d at 319.\nA. Battery and Negligence per se as to Strip Search\n[21]\nIn the case at bar, plaintiff claims that defendants' strip search of her constituted battery  and negligence per\n[22]\nse.  Defendants contend that the discretionary function exception of the KTCA relieves them from liability on\nthese two state law tort claims. The discretionary function exception of the KTCA provides in pertinent part as\nfollows:\nA governmental entity or an employee acting within the scope of the employee's employment shall\nnot be liable for damages resulting from ... any claim based upon the exercise or performance or\n1454 the *1454 failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a\ngovernmental entity or employee, whether or not the discretion is abused and regardless of the\nlevel of the discretion involved ...\nK.S.A. 75-6104(e). The discretionary function exception does not grant absolute immunity. Beck v. Kan. Adult\nAuth., 241 Kan. 13, 22, 735 P.2d 222, 233 (1987). The burden rests upon defendant to establish governmental\nimmunity. Haehn v. City of Hoisington, Kan., 702 F.Supp. 1526, 1533 (D.Kan.1988); Jackson v. City of Kansas\nCity, Kan., 235 Kan. 278, 286, 680 P.2d 877, 886 (1984).\n\n\"Discretion\" has been defined as \"the power and the privilege to act unhampered by legal rule.\" Dougan v.\nRossville Drainage Dist., supra, 243 Kan. at 323, 757 P.2d at 277. It is also defined as the capacity to distinguish\nbetween \"what is right and wrong, lawful or unlawful, wise or foolish, sufficiently to render one amenable and\nresponsible for his acts.\" Black's Law Dictionary 419 (5th ed. 1979).\nDiscretion implies the exercise of discriminating judgment within the bounds of reason. Sanford v.\nSmith, 11 Cal. App.3d 991, 1000, 90 Cal.Rptr. 256[, 261] (1970). It involves the choice of\nexercising of the will, of determination made between competing and sometimes conflicting\nconsiderations. Discretion imparts that a choice of action is determined, and that action should be\ntaken with reason and good conscience in the interest of protecting the rights of all parties and\nserving the ends of justice.\nHopkins v. State, 237 Kan. 601, 610, 702 P.2d 311, 318 (1985). In determining whether a government employee\nperformed a discretionary function, the court must focus on the \"nature and quality\" of the discretion rather than\nthe status of the employee exercising that discretion. Jackson v. City of Kansas City, Kan., supra, 235 Kan. at\n289, 680 P.2d at 888 (1984); Robertson v. City of Topeka, Kan., 231 Kan. 358, 362, 644 P.2d 458, 462 (1982).\n[23]\nAllen alleges that defendants did not exercise discretion in conducting the strip search, but acted pursuant to\nWyandotte County Sheriff's Department policies and procedures. The first paragraph of defendants' search policy\nstates that all searches at the county's detention center shall be conducted pursuant to Kansas statutory law.\nMore specifically, paragraph 3(a)(1) adds that strip searches of incoming detainees will be performed \"in\naccordance with Kansas statutes.\" K.S.A. 22-2524 governs the administration of strip searches. The statute\nspecifically permits the strip search of a person accused of a crime when that person \"is, of necessity, confined\nwith other prisoners.\" K.S.A. 22-2524(b). This Kansas statute, however, did not require that the defendant officers\nconduct a strip search of Allen. In other words, even when it is necessary to confine a person charged with\nviolating K.S.A. 8-262 with other prisoners, the decision of whether to conduct a strip search of that traffic\noffender remains within the sole discretion of the law enforcement officer. We therefore conclude that the decision\nto strip search plaintiff was a discretionary function. Accordingly, the court will enter summary judgment on\nplaintiff's pendent state law claims of battery and negligence per se as to the alleged strip search.\nB. False and Negligent Imprisonment\nAllen alleges that the Sheriff's Department falsely imprisoned and unlawfully detained her at the Wyandotte\n1455 County Detention Center.[24] Plaintiff also claims *1455 that Sergeant Riley and Officer Robinson negligently and\n[25]\ncarelessly allowed her to be detained at the jail.  The Sheriff's Department maintains that it is protected by the\n\"enforcement of law\" exception to the KTCA, K.S.A. 75-6104(c). Subsection (c) of K.S.A. 75-6104 provides\ngovernmental entities and government employees acting within the scope of their employment with immunity for\n\"enforcement of or failure to enforce a law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited to, any statute,\nregulation, ordinance or resolution.\" If the actions of a government entity or employee are outside the purview of\nthe statute, regulation, ordinance or resolution, however, the exception contained in K.S.A. 75-6104(c) is\ninapplicable. Jackson v. City of Kansas City, Kan., supra, 235 Kan. at 285, 680 P.2d at 885.\nIn the instant action, defendants merely placed plaintiff in custody pursuant to Kansas statutory law. KUMC police\narrested Allen for driving on a suspended license in violation of K.S.A. 8-262(a)(1). K.S.A.1989 Supp. 8-2104(a)\n(2) provides that a person stopped by a law enforcement officer for violation of K.S.A. 8-262 \"shall be taken into\ncustody and taken without necessary delay before a judge of the district court.\" There is no evidence that\ndefendants acted outside the scope or purview of Kansas statutory law. We have no trouble concluding that the\ndefendant Sheriff's Department was enforcing state law by placing plaintiff in custody. Accordingly, the court will\ngrant defendants' summary judgment motion as to Allen's claims of false and negligent imprisonment.\n\nC. Negligent Training, Supervision and Adoption of Policies\nAllen alleges that the Sheriff's Department was negligent in its provision of training and supervision to deputies.\nPlaintiff also claims that defendants \"negligently ... failed to adopt policies, procedures, rules, guidelines and\nregulations which would have reduced the likelihood of or prevented the occurrence of said unlawful detainment,\n[26]\nimprisonment, and strip search of plaintiff.\"  The Sheriff's Department contends that the \"police protection\"\nexception to the KTCA, K.S.A. 75-6104(n), precludes plaintiff from recovering on her negligence claims.\nSubsection (n) of K.S.A. 75-6104 provides that governmental entities and employees acting within the scope of\ntheir employment shall not be liable for the \"failure to provide, or the method of providing, police ... protection.\"\n[27]\nThere is no question that the Sheriff's Department was providing \"police protection\" by taking Allen into its\ncustody. Under Kansas statutory law, the term \"law enforcement officer\" includes \"wardens, superintendents,\ndirectors, security personnel, and keepers of prisons, penitentiaries, jails and other institutions for the detention of\npersons accused or convicted of crime.\" K.S.A. 22-2202(13).\nThe operation of a penal institution is carried on pursuant to the police power of the state, and the\ninstitution itself provides police protection for all Kansas residents by keeping apart from the rest\n1456 of the population those convicted felony *1456 offenders whose actions have been and perhaps\npromise to be dangerous and inimical to society.\nCansler v. State, 234 Kan. 554, 571, 675 P.2d 57, 70 (1984) (emphasis added); see also Jackson v. City of\nKansas City, Kan., supra, 235 Kan. at 292, 680 P.2d at 890 (subsection (m) is aimed at such basic matters as the\ntype and number of police cars; how many personnel might be required; and the selection of equipment options).\nWe are of the opinion that the provision of training and supervision as well as the adoption of policies and\n[28]\nprocedures are covered by the police protection exception to the Kansas Tort Claims Act.  Accordingly, the\ncourt will enter summary judgment for defendants on plaintiff's claims of negligence.\nIX. RECOVERY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES\nDefendants move for summary judgment on Allen's requests for punitive damages in Counts II, III, and IV. The\nSheriff's Department directs the court's attention to subsection (c) of K.S.A. 75-6105, which states:\nA governmental entity shall not be liable for punitive damages or exemplary damages or for\ninterest prior to judgment. An employee acting within the scope of the employee's employment\nshall not be liable for punitive or exemplary damages or for interest prior to judgment, except for\nany act or omission of the employee because of actual fraud or actual malice.\nSee also Polson v. Davis, 635 F.Supp. 1130, 1153 (D.Kan.1986) (Kansas Tort Claims Act precluded recovery of\npunitive damages from city); Lantz v. City of Lawrence, Kan., 232 Kan. 492, 499, 657 P.2d 539, 545 (1983)\n(employee whose acts are exempted by statute not liable for punitive damages). There is no indication that the\nSheriff's Department engaged in fraud or malice. Accordingly, the court will grant defendants' summary judgment\n[29]\nmotion as to plaintiff's request for punitive damages on her state law tort claims.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the summary judgment motion of defendants as to plaintiff's claim that the\nduration of her detainment constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Doc. No.\n51) is hereby granted.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all claims against the\n\"Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department\" as an entity (Doc. No. 51) is granted.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the summary judgment motion of defendants Sully, Riley, and Robinson as to\nplaintiff's remaining claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Doc. No. 51) is granted.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff's common law claims of\nbattery, false imprisonment, negligent imprisonment, negligence per se, and negligent training, supervision, and\nadoption of policies (Doc. No. 51) is granted.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' summary judgment motion as to plaintiff's request for punitive\ndamages in Counts II, III, and IV (Doc. No. 51) is granted.\n1457 *1457 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff's motion pursuant to Local Rule 206(d) for oral argument on\ndefendants' summary judgment motion (Doc. No. 61) is denied.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion of defendants (Doc. No. 51) for summary judgment is hereby denied\nas to plaintiff's section 1983 claim against defendant Joan A. Grogan, alleging a strip search conducted under\ncolor of state law deprived plaintiff of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be secure in her person\nagainst unreasonable searches.\n[1] Plaintiff's counsel has failed to comply with Local Rule 206. Subsection (c) of Local Rule 206 requires the\ndisputed facts contained in memoranda in opposition to motions for summary judgment to be numbered by\nparagraph. Unless the movant's facts are specifically controverted by the opposing party's statement of facts, the\nfacts set forth in the statement of the movant shall be deemed admitted. Id. Further, Allen's attorney also failed to\nappend relevant portions of pleadings, depositions, etc. to his memorandum in opposition to defendants' motion\nfor summary judgment. In the present case, defendants did not object to the violation of Rule 206 by Allen's\nattorney. The court will not hesitate in the future, however, to hold plaintiff's counsel to the strictures of Rule 206.\n[2] Plaintiff appears when she refers to the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department to mean Sheriff Owen L.\nSully. Allen makes no distinction between Sheriff Sully acting in his official capacity and the entity of the Sheriff's\nDepartment as a whole. Nothing in Kansas statutory or common law imposes liability upon sheriffs' departments\nfor alleged violations of the rights of those detained in county jails. Rather, K.S.A. 19-811 states that the sheriff\nshall have \"charge and custody\" of the jail in his or her county and shall be liable for the acts of his or her deputy\nor jailer. We therefore hold that the \"Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department\" is an improper party and enter\nsummary judgment in defendants' favor as to any claims against the Sheriff's Department.\n[3] A \"strip search\" is defined as the removal or rearrangement of \"some or all of a person's clothing, by or at the\ndirection of a law enforcement officer, so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus or female\nbreasts of such person.\" K.S.A. 22-2520(a). Strip searches \"are not a novelty, and are often necessary in order to\nrecover contraband or prevent the destruction of incriminating evidence.\" United States v. Poe, 713 F.2d 579, 584\n(10th Cir.1983),cert. denied,466 U.S. 936, 104 S.Ct. 1907, 80 L.Ed.2d 456 (1984); see also United States v.\nMendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 566, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1883, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (DEA agents lawfully stopped traveler\nchanging planes and escorted her to office for strip search of her person), reh'g denied,448 U.S. 908, 100 S.Ct.\n3051, 65 L.Ed.2d 1138 (1980); United States v. Fitzgibbon, 576 F.2d 279, 284 (10th Cir.) (strip search of\nappellant by customs officials at airport was lawful), cert. denied,439 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 279, 58 L.Ed.2d 256\n(1978); State v. Ross, 247 Kan. 191, 193, 795 P.2d 937, 939 (1990) (complete strip search of pretrial detainee at\ncounty detention center); State v. Walker, 217 Kan. 186, 187, 535 P.2d 924, 926 (1975) (officers conducted strip\nsearch before admitting arrestee into jail).\n[4] A person's first conviction under K.S.A. 8-262(a)(1) constitutes a class B misdemeanor. There is no indication\nthat Allen had previously been convicted of driving a motor vehicle on a suspended license.\n[5] K.S.A.1989 Supp. 22-2202(9) defines \"custody\" as \"the restraint of a person pursuant to an arrest or the order\nof a court or magistrate.\"\n[6] Any reliance by Allen on K.S.A. 22-2521(a) is misplaced. It is entirely possible that the strip search of plaintiff\nwas a violation of K.S.A. 22-2521(a). \"Section 1983 does not, however, provide a basis for redressing violations\nof state law, but only for those violations of federal law done under color of state law.\" Jones v. City & County of\nDenver, Colo., 854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir.1988); see also Spielman v. Hildebrand, 873 F.2d 1377, 1385 (10th\nCir.1989) (threshold inquiry in § 1983 action is whether any federal right has been violated); United States v.\n\nLopez, 777 F.2d 543, 550-51 (10th Cir. 1985) (validity of search and seizure depends on whether officers had\nprobable cause under federal law). It is therefore irrelevant to plaintiff's action for deprivation of civil rights that the\ndeputy conducting the strip search may have violated Kansas statutory law. See Munz v. City of St. John, Kan.,\n1990 WL 260528, No. 88-1342, slip op. at 1 (D.Kan. Dec. 19, 1990) (violation of K.S.A. 22-2521 does not\nestablish strip search was unconstitutional). The only issue is whether the strip search in the case at bar violated\nAllen's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by the Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments.\n[7] Obviously, the alleged strip search conducted by the Sheriff's Department was not a random or unauthorized\nact. Defendants concede any request that Allen remove her clothing would have been made pursuant to an\nestablished state policy and procedure which requires persons who are accused of driving on a suspended\nlicense to succumb to a strip search where they are \"of necessity, confined with other prisoners.\" See K.S.A.1989\nSupp. 8-2104(a)(2); K.S.A. 22-2524(b); Wyandotte County Sheriff's Office Detention Center Policies and\nProcedures, E-150.\n[8] The Fourth Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, provides in pertinent part as follows:\n[T]he right of the people to be secured in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\nbe violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause....\nIt is an established Fourth Amendment principle that \"the greater the intrusion, the greater must be the reason for\nconducting a search.\" Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d 1437, 1439 (10th Cir. 1986) (quoting Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d\n556, 565 (1st Cir.1985)).\n[9]See also L. McIntosh & J. Adams, Nineteenth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: Prisoners' Substantive\nRights, 78 Georgetown L.J. 1430, ___ (1990) (courts closely scrutinize reasonableness of strip searches by\nbalancing need for search against extent of invasion).\n[10] Judge Crow noted in the Cruz case that strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital\nareas are \"`demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submission.'\" Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, Ill., 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983)\n(quoting Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980)); Cruz v. Finney\nCounty, Kan., supra, 656 F.Supp. at 1005 (Crow, J.) (quoting Tinetti v.Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491\n(E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980)).\n[11] The Tenth Circuit concluded in Hill that a jail's \"desire to maintain security, to avoid charges of discriminatory\ntreatment, and to promote administrative convenience\" do not justify routine strip searches of persons detained\nfor minor traffic offenses. Hill v. Bogans, supra, 735 F.2d at 394-95; see also Thompson v. City of Los Angeles,\nCal., 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989) (fact that arrestee was placed in contact with general jail population\ncould not by itself justify strip search of arrestee for purposes of civil rights action); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d\n1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989) (possibility of contact with other prisoners after alleged arrest for failure to appear for\nhearing on traffic violations was not sufficient justification for strip search), cert. denied,493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct.\n503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989). The court finds the rationale of Hill, Thompson, and Masters highly persuasive\nwhen the person charged with a minor offense and strip searched simply as a precaution before placing him or\nher in the general jail population is confined in a facility which has the physical capacity to detain that person in a\nseparate area.\n[12] In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the\npractice of conducting routine body cavity searches of prisoners following contact visits with persons outside the\nprison was \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment. The inmates in Wolfish, however, were charged with\noffenses more serious than mere traffic violations and were being held for substantial pretrial periods. Id. at 524,\n99 S.Ct. at 1866.\n[13] The court is not merely concluding that defendants violated K.S.A. 22-2521(a). Rather, we are holding that\nthe strip search of any person accused of a traffic offense when there is no showing of the necessity to confine\nthat person with other prisoners constitutes an unreasonable search in violation of Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights.\n\n[14] Allen also appears to argue that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the Sheriff's\nDepartment failed to possess probable cause before it detained her. Under the Fourth Amendment, the\ngovernment's interest in detecting and preventing crime are subject to the traditional standards of probable\ncause. See, e.g. Torres v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 474, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 2431, 61 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1979) (generalized urgency of law enforcement does not justify violation of Fourth Amendment probable cause\nrequirement); United States v. Lopez, 777 F.2d 543, 550 (10th Cir.1985) (right to search and validity of seizure do\nnot depend on right to arrest). In the case at bar, however, the Sheriff's Department was not involved in the arrest\nof plaintiff, and therefore, this defendant cannot be liable for any lack of probable cause. A county jail cannot be\ncharged with the responsibility of screening all suspects who have been arrested by the various police\ndepartments throughout the county for the purpose of determining whether probable cause existed for the\narrests.\n[15] The essential purpose of the proscription in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of\nreasonableness upon discretion by government officials, including law enforcement agents, in order to safeguard\nprivacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasion. Delawarev. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653-54, 99 S.Ct.\n1391, 1395-96, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).\n[16] Even if plaintiff meets this burden, defendants may nonetheless prevail if they can establish \"extraordinary\ncircumstances\" and can prove that they neither knew nor should have known of the relevant legal standard. \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, 457 U.S. at 819, 102 S.Ct. at 2738; Pleasant v. Lovell, supra, 876 F.2d at 794.\n[17] The contours of the law must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he or\nshe is doing violates that law. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523\n(1987). Whether the law is clearly established \"should be determined in a particularized sense.\" Watson v. City of\nKansas City, Kan., supra, 857 F.2d at 697 (quoting Garrett v. Rader. 831 F.2d 202, 204 (10th Cir.1987)).\n[18]See also Project, Nineteenth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: Warrantless Searches and Seizures, 78\nGeorgetown L.J. 718, ___ (1990) (strip search of person arrested for misdemeanor or other minor offense\njustified only when particularized suspicion exists that person is concealing contraband); A. Loewy, The Fourth\nAmendment as a Device for Protecting the Innocent, 81 Mich.L.Rev. 1229, ___ (1983) (properly construed Fourth\nAmendment should forbid strip searches in absence of probable cause).\n[19] Since plaintiff's § 1983 claim has survived summary judgment in part, the court will not address defendants'\nargument as to pendent jurisdiction.\n[20] A \"governmental entity\" is defined as a \"state or municipality.\" K.S.A. 75-6102(c). An \"employee\" includes\n\"any ... elected or appointed officials and persons acting on behalf or in service of a governmental entity in any\nofficial capacity, whether with or without compensation.\" K.S.A. 75-6102(d).\n[21] A \"battery\" is the \"unprivileged touching or striking of one person by another, done with the intent of bringing\nabout either a contact or an apprehension of contact, that is harmful or offensive.\" Pattern Instructions for\nKansas, § 14.02 (2d ed. 1977) (citing 6 Am.Jur.2d, Assault and Battery, § 5 (1963)). An intent to injure is a\nprerequisite in battery cases. Murray v. Modoc State Bank, 181 Kan. 642, 646, 313 P.2d 304, 307 (1957).\n[22] Negligence per se consists of the breach of a duty imposed by a specific requirement of law. Plains Transp.\nof Kan., Inc. v. King, 224 Kan. 17, 25, 578 P.2d 1095, 1101 (1978); Noland v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 207 Kan.\n72, 74-75, 483 P.2d 1029, 1032 (1971). The distinction between \"negligence\" and \"negligence per se\" is the\nmeans and method of ascertainment, in that the former must be found by the factfinder from the evidence, while\nthe latter results from violation of a statute, ordinance or regulation; and the only fact for the determination of the\nfactfinder is the commission or omission of the specific act prohibited or required. Watkins v. Hartsock, 245 Kan.\n756, 761, 783 P.2d 1293, 1297 (1989) (citing Kendrick v. Atchinson, Topeka & Santa Fe R.R. Co., 182 Kan. 249,\n258-59, 320 P.2d 1061, 1070 (1958)).\n[23] The premier case on K.S.A. 75-6104(e) is Robertson v. City of Topeka, Kan., 231 Kan. 358, 644 P.2d 458\n(1982), wherein the court rejected the planning level-operational level test of the Federal Tort Claims Act\ndiscretionary function exception, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a), in favor of the nature and quality of the discretion exercise\n\ntest. Robertson, supra, 231 Kan. at 362, 644 P.2d at 462. In reviewing federal decisions, the Robertson court was\nparticularly impressed with Downs v. United States, 522 F.2d 990 (6th Cir.1975), wherein the Sixth Circuit\nconcluded that it is not the mere exercise of judgment \"which immunizes the United States from liability for the\ntorts of its employees.\" Id. at 995.\n[24] False imprisonment consists of the illegal restraint of one person's liberty by the act of another person. \nHolland v. Lutz, 194 Kan. 712, 714, 401 P.2d 1015, 1018 (1965) (citing 22 Am. Jur., False Imprisonment, §§ 2, 3\n(1967)).\n[25] Negligence consists of the failure to exercise that degree of care and vigilance for interests of another which\nis rightly required under the prevailing circumstances. Chaplin v. Gas Serv. Co., 194 Kan. 26, 29, 397 P.2d 317,\n319 (1964) (quoting Blackmore v. Auer, 187 Kan. 434, 440, 357 P.2d 765, 770 (1960)).\n[26] The Supreme Court of Kansas has noted on several occasions that \"it would be virtually impossible for police\ndepartments to establish specific guidelines designed to anticipate every situation an officer might encounter in\nthe course of his [or her] work.\" See, e.g. Mendoza v. Reno County, Kan., 235 Kan. 692, 694, 681 P.2d 676, 678\n(1984); Robertson v. City of Topeka, Kan., supra, 231 Kan. at 362, 644 P.2d at 462. We believe that it would be\nequally difficult for penitentiaries, jails and other institutions that detain persons accused and convicted of crime\nto create guidelines that cover every occurrence personnel may confront in those facilities.\n[27]See also Beck v. Kan. Adult Auth., 241 Kan. 13, 24, 735 P.2d 222, 231 (1987) (University of Kansas Medical\nCenter not liable for method of providing police protection).\n[28] In a negligence action, the plaintiff must establish a duty of reasonable care owed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff, a breach of that duty, damage to the plaintiff, and a causal connection between the duty breached and\nthe damage sustained. Tersiner v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 740 F.Supp. 1519, 1524 (D.Kan.1990); Durflinger v.\nArtiles, 234 Kan. 484, 488, 673 P.2d 86, 91 (1983). Summary judgment is also appropriate in this case because\nplaintiff has failed to prove a duty owed to her by the Sheriff's Department on which actionable negligence will lie.\nAs a general rule, law enforcement officers owe a duty to the public as a whole, not to individuals. Commercial\nUnion Ins. Co. v. City of Wichita, Kan., 217 Kan. 44, 53, 536 P.2d 54, 63 (1975).\n[29] Defendants also argue that plaintiff may not recover punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in Count I of\nthe First Amended Complaint. The issue of punitive damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 has already been\nresolved. The court previously dismissed Allen's request for punitive damages against all defendants. See Allen\nv. Bd. of County Comm'rs of the County of Wyandotte, Kan., No. 90-2059-O, slip op. at 9-11, 1990 WL 254978\n(D.Kan. Dec. 7, 1990).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

ALLEGED DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS  The  Fourth  Amendment  applies  with  its  fullest  vigor \nThe  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1871  (hereinafter  “the  Act”)  against any intrusion of the human body.

Finally,  plaintiff  further \nsearch. Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir.1984)  alleges that Grogan left the door of the closet in which the \n(citing Smith v.

Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 559; Bono v. Saxbe,  place.12 In light of this most obvious question of fact, \n527 F.Supp. 1182, 1185 (S.D.Ill.), aff’d in part, 620 F.2d  summary  judgment  cannot  be  entered.13  Accordingly, \n609 (7th Cir.1980).11 Any policy permitting strip searches  plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment will be \nmust be tightly drawn to assure that Fourth Amendment  denied by the court. \nrights are not violated. Where the strip search of a person    \nis conducted pursuant to a policy or statute encompassing  IT  IS  THEREFORE  ORDERED  that  the  summary \nall arrestees and there is no reason to suspect that the  judgment  motion  of  plaintiff  (Doc.No.  53)  is  hereby \nperson is harboring drugs, weapons or contraband, the  denied. \nsearch  is  arbitrary  and  purposeless,  and  thus    \nunconstitutional. Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep’t,  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion of plaintiff \n901 F.2d 702, 715–16 (9th Cir.1989); Stewart v. Lubbock  for oral argument (Doc.No. 61) is denied. \nCounty, Tex., 767 F.2d 153, 156–57 (5th Cir.1985), cert.    \ndenied, 475 U.S. 1066 (1986); Doe v. Calumet City, Ill.,  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants’ motion for \n754 F.Supp. 1211, 1220–21 (N.D.Ill.1990).  summary  judgment  as  to  all  claims  against  the \n   “Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department” as an entity \n*4  In  the  present  case,  plaintiff  claims  that  she  was  (Doc.No. 51) is granted. \ninstructed by Deputy Grogan to remove her jacket, shirt,    \nshoes, and brassiere. After issuing this instruction, Grogan  \t\r  \nallegedly reached under plaintiff’s brassiere and touched \nher breasts. Plaintiff also contends that the deputy pulled \n Footnotes \n \n1  Plaintiff appears when she refers to the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department to mean Sheriff Owen L. Sully. Allen makes no \ndistinction between Sheriff Sully acting in his official capacity and the entity of the Sheriff’s Department as a whole. Nothing in \n \nKansas statutory or common law imposes liability upon sheriffs’ departments for alleged violations of the rights of those detained \nin county jails. Rather, K.S.A. 19–811 states that the sheriff shall have “charge and custody” of the jail in his or her county and \nshall be liable for the acts of his or her deputy or jailer. We therefore hold that the “Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department” is an \nimproper party and enter summary judgment in defendants’ favor as to any claims against the Sheriff’s Department. \n \n2  A “strip search” is defined as the removal or rearrangement of “some or all of a person’s clothing, by or at the direction of a law \nenforcement officer, so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus or female breasts of such person.” K.S.A. \n \n22–2520(a). Strip searches “are not a novelty, and are often necessary in order to recover contraband or prevent the destruction of \nincriminating evidence.”  United States v. Poe, 713 F.2d 579, 584 (10th Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 936 (1984); see also \nUnited States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 566 (DEA agents lawfully stopped traveler changing planes and escorted her to office \nfor strip search of her person), reh’g denied, 448 U.S. 908 (1980); United States v. Fitzgibbon, 576 F.2d 279, 284 (10th Cir.) (strip \nsearch of appellant by customs officials at airport was lawful), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 910 (1978); State v. Ross, 247 Kan. 191, 193, \n795 P.2d 937, 939 (1990) (complete strip search of pretrial detainee at county detention center); State v. Walker, 217 Kan. 186, \n187, 535 P.2d 924, 926 (1975) (officers conducted strip search before admitting arrestee into jail). \n \n3  A person’s first conviction under K.S.A. 8–262(a)(1) constitutes a class B misdemeanor. There is no indication that Allen had \npreviously been convicted of driving a motor vehicle on a suspended license. \n \n \n4  K.S.A. 1989 Supp. 22–2202(9) defines “custody” as “the restraint of a person pursuant to an arrest or the order of a court or \nmagistrate.” \n \n \n5  Any reliance by Allen on K.S.A. 22–2521(a) is misplaced. It is entirely possible that the strip search of plaintiff was a violation of \nK.S.A. 22–2521(a). “Section 1983 does not, however, provide a basis for redressing violations of state law, but only for those \n \nviolations of federal law done under color of state law.” Jones v. City & County of Denver, Colo., 854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th \nCir.1988); see also Spielman v. Hildebrand, 873 F.2d 1377, 1385 (10th Cir.1989) (threshold inquiry in § 1983 action is whether \nany federal right has been violated); United States v. Lopez, 777 F.2d 543, 550–51 (10th Cir.1985) (validity of search and seizure \ndepends on whether officers had probable cause under federal law). It is therefore irrelevant to plaintiff’s action for deprivation of \ncivil rights that the deputy conducting the strip search may have violated Kansas statutory law. See Munz v. City of St. John, Kan., \n1990 WL 260528, No. 88–1342, slip op. at 1 (D.Kan. Dec. 19, 1990) (violation of K.S.A. 22–2521 does not establish strip search \n  3 \n \n\nAllen v. Board of Com’rs of County of Wyandotte, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1991)   \n \nwas unconstitutional). The only issue is whether the strip search in the case at bar violated Allen’s constitutional right against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n \n6  Obviously, the alleged strip search conducted by the Sheriff’s Department was not a random or unauthorized act. Defendants \nconcede any request that Allen remove her clothing would have been made pursuant to an established state policy and procedure \n \nwhich requires persons who are accused of driving on a suspended license to succumb to a strip search where they are “of \nnecessity, confined with other prisoners.” See K.S.A.1989 Supp. 8–2104(a)(2); K.S.A. 22–2524(b); Wyandotte County Sheriff’s \nOffice Detention Center Policies and Procedures, E–150. \n \n7  The Fourth Amendment, as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, provides in pertinent part as follows: \n[T]he right of the people to be secured in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and \n \nno warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.... \nIt is an established Fourth Amendment principle that “the greater the intrusion, the greater must be the reason for conducting a \nsearch.”  Levoy v. Mills, 788 F.2d 1437, 1439 (10th Cir.1986) (quoting Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 565 (1st Cir.1985)). \n \n8  See also  L. McIntosh & J. Adams, Nineteenth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: Prisoners’ Substantive Rights, 78 \nGeorgetown L.J. 1430, –––– (1990) (courts closely scrutinize reasonableness of strip searches by balancing need for search against \n \nextent of invasion). \n \n9  Judge Crow noted in the Cruz case that strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas are “ \n‘demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and \n \nsubmission.’ ”  Marybeth G. v. City of Chicago, Ill., 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. \n486, 491 (E.D.Wisc.1979), aff’d, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980)); Cruz v. Finney County, Kan., supra, 656 F.Supp. at 1005 (Crow, \nJ.) (quoting Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wisc.1979), aff’d, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980)). \n \n10  The Tenth Circuit concluded in Hill that a jail’s “desire to maintain security, to avoid charges of discriminatory treatment, and to \npromote administrative convenience” do not justify routine strip searches of persons detained for minor traffic offenses. Hill v. \n \nBogans, supra, 735 F.2d at 394–95; see also Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, Cal., 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.1989) (fact that \narrestee was placed in contact with general jail population could not by itself justify strip search of arrestee for purposes of civil \nrights action); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989) (possibility of contact with other prisoners after alleged \narrest for failure to appear for hearing on traffic violations was not sufficient justification for strip search), cert. denied, 493 U.S. \n977, 110 S.Ct. 503 (1989). The court finds the rationale of Hill, Thompson, and Masters highly persuasive when the person is \ncharged with a minor offense and strip searched simply as a precaution before placing him or her in the general jail population is \nconfined in a facility which has the physical capacity to detain that person in a separate area. \n \n11  In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Court held that the practice of conducting routine body cavity searches of \nprisoners following contact visits with persons outside the prison was “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. The inmates in \n \nWolfish, however, were charged with offenses more serious than mere traffic violations and were being held for substantial pretrial \nperiods. Id. at 524. \n \n12  More specifically, Deputy Grogan testified that she would not have performed a strip search of plaintiff unless Allen was charged \nwith a drug offense and she (Grogan) had received authorization from the sergeant to conduct such a search. Grogan added that she \n \ndid not remember plaintiff. \n \n13  In light of the court’s entry of summary judgment in defendants’ favor as to plaintiff’s common law claims of negligent \nimprisonment, negligence per se, and negligent training, supervision, and adoption of policies, there is no need to address Allen’s \n \nrequest that defendants’ comparative negligence defenses be stricken from this case. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  4 \n ",
